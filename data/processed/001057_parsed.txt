20.  GENERIC ISSUES
This chapter discusses the evaluation by the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Committee
(NRC) to determine whether the Westinghouse AP1000 design complies with the requirements
of Title 10, Sections 52.47(a)(1)(ii) and (iv), of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR
52.47(a)(1)(ii) and (iv)), and whether the design incorporates current operating experience.  As
required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv), the applicant for a standard design certification (DC) must
propose resolutions of Unresolved Safety Issues (USIs) and medium- and high-priority Generic
Safety Issues (GSIs), as defined in NUREG-0933, “A Prioritization of Generic Safety Issues.” 
These issues must be (1) technically relevant to the design and (2) identified in the applicable
supplement to NUREG-0933 that was current 6 months before the application.  In addition,
10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) requires the applicant to demonstrate compliance with any technically
relevant portions of the Three Mile Island (TMI) Action Plan items addressed in 10 CFR
50.34(f).
Because a large number of issues are relevant to the AP1000 design, the staff grouped its
evaluations into the following sections, according to the issue type in Appendix B to
NUREG-0933:

Section 20.2 contains the task action plan items.

Section 20.3 contains the new generic issues.

Section 20.4 contains the TMI Action Plan items.

Section 20.5 contains the human factors issues.

Section 20.6 lists the 10 CFR 50.34(f) TMI Action Plan items relevant to the AP1000
design.

Section 20.7 discusses the incorporation of operating experience into the AP1000
design through generic communications.
20.1  Overview of Staff Conclusions
20.1.1  Compliance with 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv)
As stated above, an application for DC must include proposed resolutions of the USIs and
medium- and high-priority GSIs that are technically relevant to the design and are identified in
the NUREG-0933 supplement that was current 6 months before the application.
The applicant made its application for the AP1000 standardized plant design in the Design
Control Document (DCD) Tier 2, in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 52.45.  The staff
reviewed Supplement 25 to NUREG-0933 to identify the list of issues in Appendix B to
NUREG-0933, “Applicability of NUREG-0933 Issues to Operating and Future Plants,” that
should be addressed to conform to 10 CFR Section 52.47(a)(1)(iv).  The staff also added nine
other issues (A-17, A-29, B-5, 14, 22, 29, 43, 82, and II.K.3(5)) that were resolved without the
issuance of new requirements, but for which the staff had recommended developing specific
guidance for future plants.
Generic Issues
20-2
Sections 20.2 through 20.5 of this report evaluate the issues that need to be resolved for the
AP1000 design to comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv).  DCD Tier 2,
Section 1.9.4, includes additional issues that the applicant considers applicable to the AP1000
design.  The staff also evaluated these issues.
The applicant evaluated the issues in Supplement 25 to NUREG-0933 to determine those
issues technically relevant to the AP1000 design. 
The staff concludes that the applicant has adequately demonstrated that the AP1000 design
complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv) because it has addressed the issues
in the relevant supplement of NUREG-0933. 
20.1.2  Compliance with 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii)
As stated above, 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) requires a DC applicant to demonstrate compliance
with any technically relevant parts of the TMI Action Plan requirements found in
10 CFR 50.34(f).  The applicant addressed these requirements in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3,
and Section 20.6 of this report further discusses these requirements.  Because of the overlap
between the TMI Action Plan items and those from NUREG-0933 (discussed in Section 20.4 of
this report), Section 20.6 lists all the relevant TMI Action Plan items in tabular form.  This
provides the issue designation and a reference to the appropriate issue in Section 20.4 of this
report, which summarizes the evaluation of the TMI Action Plan items.
The staff concludes that the applicant has adequately demonstrated that the AP1000 design
complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) because it has addressed the relevant
TMI Action Plan items found in 10 CFR 50.34(f), except as noted in this report. 
20.1.3  Incorporation of Operating Experience
In a staff requirements memorandum (SRM), dated February 15, 1991, concerning
SECY-90-377, “Requirements for Design Certification Under 10 CFR Part 52,” the Commission
directed the staff to ensure that the DC process preserves operating experience insights in the
certified design.  The applicant submitted its evaluation for the AP1000 design in the Topical
Report Westinghouse Commercial Atomic Power (WCAP)-15800, “Operational Assessment for
AP1000.”  As discussed in Section 20.7 of this report, the staff concludes that the applicant has
adequately considered operating experience because the AP1000 design addresses generic
letters (GLs) and bulletins (BLs) issued by the Commission between January 1, 1980, and
January 31, 2002, except as noted in this report.
20.1.4  Resolution of Issues Relevant to the AP1000 Design
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2 and in Section 1.9.4, the applicant listed the issues in
Supplement 25 of NUREG-0933 that it considered relevant to the AP1000 design.  The
applicant also justified why it did not consider an issue to be relevant to the design. 
Sections 20.2 through 20.6 of this report discuss the resolution of the issues that the applicant
and the staff considered relevant to the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-3
Table 20.1-1 of this report lists the USIs and GSIs relevant to the AP1000 design, the sections
in which these issues appear in this chapter, and the basis for the relevance of each issue to
the design.  The relevance of the issues falls into one of the following categories.  The actual
designation used in Table 20.1-1 of this report is included in parentheses.

The issue is required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv) (52.47).

The issue was selected by the applicant as being relevant in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4 
(W).

The staff decided to discuss the issue as being relevant to the AP1000 (staff).
The applicant justified its decision not to consider an issue as relevant to the AP1000 design in
DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2 and Section 1.9.4.  The staff reviewed the justifications for those
issues that the staff considered relevant to the design to meet the requirements of 10 CFR
52.47(a)(1)(iv).  DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, note f states that this screening determined that the
issue was not a DC issue, but is the responsibility of the Combined License (COL) applicant. 
This is COL Action Item 20.1.4-1.

20.2  Task Action Plan Items
This section compares the task action plan items listed in Table 20.1-1 of this report to the
AP1000 design.  The majority of the items were chosen either because (1) the design must
comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv) or 10 CFR 50.34(f), or (2) the applicant
decided that the item applied to the design and included a discussion of the item in DCD Tier 2.
Issue A-1:  Water Hammer
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-1 addresses the issue of water hammer in the fluid
systems of nuclear power plants.  Water hammer can be caused by a number of conditions,
such as voiding in normally filled lines, condensation in lines, entrainment of water in
steam-filled lines, or rapid valve actuation.  Issue A-1 addresses these probable causes, as well
as possible methods for minimizing the susceptibility of systems to water hammer through
design and operational considerations.  This issue was resolved with the publication of
NUREG-0927, “Evaluation of Water Hammer Occurrences in Nuclear Power Plants,”
Revision 1, dated March 1984, which contains evaluation results of water hammer events, as
well as recommendations and measures for water hammer prevention and mitigation.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design meets the
guidance of applicable Standard Review Plan (SRP) sections in NUREG-0800, “Standard
Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants—LWR
Edition,” that provide criteria for mitigating water hammer concerns, and in NUREG-0927.  The
applicant also addressed design features and system operation of the AP1000 to mitigate or
prevent water hammer damage.  The applicant stated that design features are incorporated in
the applicable systems, including the steam generator (SG) feedrings and piping, passive core
cooling system (PXS), passive residual heat removal (PRHR) system, service water system
(SWS), feedwater system, and steam lines.  These features are summarized below.
The automatic depressurization system (ADS) uses multiple, sequenced valve stages to
provide a relatively slow, controlled depressurization of the reactor coolant system (RCS), which
helps reduce the potential for water hammer.  Once depressurization is complete, gravity
injection from the in-containment refueling water storage tank (IRWST) is initiated by opening
check valves, which reposition slowly.  Gravity injection flow actuates slowly, without water
hammer, as the pressure differential across the check valves equalizes and the valves open
and initiate flow.
The PRHR system heat exchangers (PRHR HXs) are normally aligned with open inlet valves
and closed discharge valves.  This keeps the system piping at RCS pressure and prevents
water hammer upon initiation of flow through the heat exchangers.
The core makeup tanks (CMTs) are normally aligned to the cold leg to keep the tanks at RCS
pressure.  The line is also normally kept filled with steam to prevent water hammer upon
actuation of the CMT.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.3, provides additional information on the PXS.
The design and operation of the feedwater delivery system minimizes the potential for water
hammer in the feedwater line.  The features of the SG introduce feedwater into the SG at an
elevation above the top of the tube bundles and below the normal water level by a top
discharge spray tube feedring.  The layout of the feedwater line is consistent with industry
Generic Issues
20-9
standard recommendations to reduce the potential of an SG water hammer.  In addition, the
operational limitations on flow to recover SG levels and on early feedwater flow into the SG
minimize the potential for water hammer.
The startup feedwater system is a non-safety-related system that provides heated feedwater
during plant startup, shutdown, and hot standby.  The heated feedwater reduces the potential
for water hammer in the feedwater piping and SG feedrings.
The main steamlines are designed to remove accumulated condensate from the main
steamlines and to maintain the turbine bypass header at operating temperature during plant
operation.  The system is designed to accommodate flows during startup, shutdown, transients,
and normal operation.  This protects the turbine and turbine bypass valves from water slug
damage.
Based on the above discussions, supplemented by the various measures to minimize the
potential of water hammer described in DCD Tier 2, Sections 1.9.4.2.2, 5.4.2.2, 5.4.6.2, 5.4.7.2,
6.3.2.5, 9.2.1.2.2, 10.4.7, Chapter 14, and Section 3B.2.3.  WCAP-15799, “AP1000
Conformance with SRP Acceptance Criteria,” the staff concludes that the applicant has
provided acceptable commitments for the AP1000 design to meet the water hammer-related
guidelines detailed in applicable sections of the SRP and NUREG-0927.
The results from a small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) test performed earlier for the
AP600 design by Oregon State University (OSU) indicate that rapid condensation events have
the potential to cause unanticipated dynamic loads in the RCS.  The staff concludes that these
results are applicable to the AP1000 design.  The staff’s evaluation of these test results found
that the induced loads are small and inconsequential to the integrity of the components and
piping.  Based on its review of this information, the staff concludes that Issue A-1 is resolved for
the AP1000 design.
Issue A-2:  Asymmetric Blowdown Loads on Reactor Primary Coolant Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-2 addresses the concerns raised in 1975 by the Virginia
Electric Power Company that an asymmetric loading on the reactor vessel supports, resulting
from a pipe break at the vessel nozzle, had not been considered by the utility or the applicant in
the original design of the reactor vessel support system for North Anna Units 1 and 2.  In the
postulated event at the vessel nozzle, asymmetric loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) loads could
result from forces induced on the reactor internals by transient differential pressures across the
core barrel, and by forces on the vessel due to transient differential pressures in the reactor
cavity.  With the advent of more sophisticated computer codes and more detailed analytical
models, it became apparent to the applicant that such differential pressures, although of short
duration, could place a significant load on the reactor vessel supports.
The issue was resolved with the publication of NUREG-0609, “Asymmetric Blowdown Loads on
PWR Primary Systems,” in January 1981.  The asymmetric loads on the reactor vessel,
internals, primary coolant loop, and components should not exceed the limits imposed by the
applicable Codes and standards.  The staff also issued GL 84-04, “Safety Evaluation of
Westinghouse Topical Reports Dealing with Elimination of Postulated Pipe Breaks in PWR
Primary Main Loops,” on February 1, 1984, to permit the application of leak-before-break (LBB)
technology to eliminate the dynamic effects from a postulated pipe rupture from the design
Generic Issues
20-10
basis.  Subsequently, the staff revised General Design Criteria (GDC) 4, “Environmental and
Dynamic Effects Design Bases,” to permit the application of LBB.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the use of LBB criteria permits the
evaluation of the dynamic effects of pipe breaks to be eliminated in the analysis of structures,
systems, and components (SSCs).  Westinghouse uses the term “mechanistic pipe break” to
refer to “leak before break.”  GDC 4 allows the use of LBB to eliminate from the design basis
the dynamic effects of pipe ruptures postulated at locations defined in DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.6.2.  These dynamic effects include jet impingement, pipe whip, jet reaction forces on
other portions of the piping and components, subcompartment pressurization, including reactor
cavity asymmetric pressurization transients, and traveling pressure waves from the
depressurization of the system.  The AP1000 main reactor coolant loops are designed in
accordance with LBB criteria.  This is described in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.6.3, and Appendix 3B.
Section 3.6.3 of this report provides the staff’s review of this information.  Therefore, Issue A-2
is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-3:  Westinghouse Steam Generator Tube Integrity
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-3 addresses the staff’s concerns related to SG tube
degradation.  These concerns stem from the fact that the SG tubes are a part of the RCS
boundary, and that tube ruptures allow primary coolant into the secondary system where its
isolation from the environment is not fully ensured.  In 1978, Issues A-3, A-4, and A-5 were
established to evaluate the safety significance of tube degradation in Westinghouse,
Combustion Engineering (CE), and Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) SGs, respectively.  These
studies were later combined into one effort because of the similarity of many problems faced by
the pressurized-water reactor (PWR) vendors.
This issue was resolved and no new requirements were established (see SECY-88-272,
“Technical Resolution of Unresolved Safety Issues A-3, A-4, and A-5 Regarding SG Tube
Integrity,” September 1988).  However, the staff issued GL 85-02, “Staff Recommended Actions
Regarding Steam Generator Tube Integrity,” dated April 17, 1985, to provide additional details
on the recommended actions contained in the draft NUREG-0844, “NRC Integrated Program
for the Resolution of Unresolved Safety Issues A-3, A-4, A-5 Regarding Steam Generator Tube
Integrity,” which was issued in September 1988.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 SGs are designed in
accordance with GL 85-02 and NUREG-0844.  The SGs have features described in DCD
Tier 2, Section 5.4.2, to enhance tube performance and reliability.  These features include the
following:
•
The design provides access to all tubes to perform inservice inspection (ISI).
•
The tubes are fabricated from thermally treated nickel-chromium-iron Alloy 690.
•
Stainless steel support plates provide support to the tubes.
•
Contact between tubes and support plates is via the trifoil tube hole design, which
provides a high sweeping velocity to reduce sludge accumulation in crevices.
Generic Issues
20-11
•
The portion of the tube within the tube sheet is fully expanded to close the crevices
between the tube and tube sheet.
•
The SG channel head is designed to facilitate the replacement of the SG, if this is
required.
As discussed in DCD Tier 2, Sections 5.2.4 and 5.4.2, the COL applicant will develop the SG
tube preservice inspection (PSI) and ISI programs.  SG tube integrity is verified in accordance
with the surveillance program discussed in DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.15.  The programs are
plant-specific and are contained in the technical specifications (TS) for each plant.  The staff
reviewed the SG surveillance program contained in Section 5.5.4, “Steam Generator (SG) Tube
Surveillance Program,” of the TS found in DCD Tier 2,Chapter 16, “Technical Specifications,”
and found it to be acceptable, as discussed in Section 5.4.2.2 of this report.  Each plant-specific
change made by a COL applicant to this surveillance program in the TS will be reviewed by the
staff for each license application referencing the AP1000 DC.  The staff’s review will consider
the regulatory criteria in place at the time of the COL applicant’s proposed change.  This action
item is designated as COL Action Item 20.2-1.
Based on the above analysis, the staff concludes that Issue A-3 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue A-9:  Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) 
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-9 addresses the issue of ensuring that the reactor can
attain safe shutdown after incurring an anticipated transient with a failure of the reactor trip
system (RTS).  An ATWS is an expected operational occurrence (e.g., loss of feedwater, loss
of condenser vacuum, or loss of offsite power (LOOP) to the reactor) that is accompanied by a
failure of the RTS to shut down the reactor.
Issue A-9 was resolved with the publication of 10 CFR 50.62, “Requirements for Reduction of
Risk from Anticipated Transients Without Scram (ATWS) for Light-Water-Cooled Reactors.”
The acceptance criteria for the resolution of Issue A-9 are as follows:

The design must comply with the mitigation requirement of 10 CFR 50.62(c)(1) that
plant equipment must automatically initiate emergency feedwater (EFW) and a main
turbine trip under conditions indicative of an ATWS.  This equipment must function
reliably and must be diverse and independent from the RTS.

The design must comply with the prevention requirement of 10 CFR 50.62(c)(2) that the
plant must have a scram system that is diverse and independent from the existing RTS.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design complies with the
requirements in 10 CFR 50.62, except the AP1000 does not have a safety-related auxiliary
feedwater system (AFWS).  DCD Tier 2, Sections 1.9.5.1.3 and 7.7 include a discussion of the
design features to minimize the probability of an ATWS.
The applicant indicated that the AP1000 design complies with the requirements of 10 CFR
50.62 by incorporating a diverse actuation system that includes the ATWS mitigation system
Generic Issues
20-12
actuation circuitry (AMSAC) protection features mandated by 10 CFR 50.62 by tripping the
turbine and diversely actuating selected engineered safeguards functions. 
Other AP1000 design features minimize the probability of ATWS occurrence and mitigate the
consequences, as discussed in DCD Section 1.9.5.1.3.  For the AP1000 design with PXS, the
staff requires that an ATWS analysis be performed to demonstrate that its ATWS response is
consistent with that considered by the staff in its formulation of the 10 CFR 50.62 design
requirements for current plant designs.  In response to request for additional information
(RAI) 440.014, Revision 1 (see DCP/NRC1558, March 28, 2003), the applicant provided the
analysis of a complete loss of normal feedwater without reactor trip using the LOFTRAN code. 
Section 15.2.9 of this report provides a detailed discussion of this issue.  The staff reviewed the
AP1000 design and analyses and concluded that the AP1000 design meets the intent of the
10 CFR 50.62 requirements.  The staff, therefore, concludes that Issue A-9 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue A-11:  Reactor Vessel Materials Toughness
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant indicated that it considers Issue A-11 to be relevant to
the AP1000 design; however, resolution of this issue is not necessary for the AP1000 design to
meet the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv).
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-11 addresses the issue that, because of the remote
possibility that nuclear reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) designed to the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code might fail, the design of nuclear facilities must provide
protection against reactor vessel failure.
Prevention of reactor vessel failure depends primarily on maintaining the reactor vessel material
fracture toughness at levels that will resist brittle fracture during plant operation.  As plants
accumulate more service time, neutron irradiation reduces the material fracture toughness and
initial safety margins.  This issue was resolved with the publication of NUREG-0744,
“Resolution of the Task A-11, Reactor Vessel Materials Toughness Safety Issue,” Revision 1,
dated October 1982, and GL 82-26, “NUREG-0744, Revision 1, Pressure Vessel Material
Fracture Toughness,” dated November 12, 1982.  This issue did not result in establishing new
regulatory requirements.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 reactor vessel design
complies with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, “Fracture Toughness
Requirements,” and includes features to reduce neutron fluence, enhance material toughness
at low temperature, and eliminate weld seams in critical areas.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.3.2,
discuss material requirements, and DCD Tier 2, Section 5.3.3, provides pressure and
temperature limits.
The AP1000 reactor vessel design complies with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix G, and includes various features for the vessel to reduce neutron fluence, enhance
material toughness at low temperatures, and eliminate weld seams in critical areas. 
Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 of this report provide the staff’s evaluation of the vessel
material properties and fracture toughness.
Generic Issues
20-13
The staff concludes that Issue A-11 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-12:  Fracture Toughness of Steam Generator and Reactor Coolant Pump Supports
During the course of the licensing action for North Anna, Units 1 and 2, a number of questions
were raised about the potential for lamellar tearing and low-fracture toughness of the SG and
reactor coolant pump (RCP) support materials for these facilities.  Concerns regarding the
supports at North Anna were applicable to all PWRs.  The staff designated this as Issue A-12 in
NUREG-0933.
This issue was resolved and no new requirements were established (see NUREG-0577,
“Potential for Low Fracture Toughness and Lamellar Tearing in PWR Steam Generator and
Reactor Coolant Pump Supports,” Revision 1, October 1983).  However, the staff
recommended developing guidance for new plants based on the fracture toughness
requirements of ASME Code, Section III, Subsection NF, “Supports.”
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.10, describes the SG and RCP supports for the AP1000 design.  The
supports are designed and fabricated in accordance with ASME Code, Section III,
Subsection NF.  Westinghouse stated that Subsection NF requirements provide acceptable
fracture toughness for the support materials.
The staff concludes that the Westinghouse response to Issue A-12 addresses the structural
integrity of the SG and RCP supports.  Therefore, Issue A-12 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue A-13:  Snubber Operability Assurance
Snubbers are primarily used as seismic and pipe whip restraints at nuclear power plants.  They
function as rigid supports for restraining the motion of attached systems or components under
such rapidly applied load conditions as earthquakes, pipe breaks, and severe hydraulic
transients, while allowing free thermal expansion of the piping systems and components during
various operating conditions.  Issue A-13 in NUREG-0933 addresses a concern about the
substantial number of snubber malfunctions, the most frequent of which include (1) seal
leakage in hydraulic snubbers, and (2) high rejection rate during functional testing of snubbers. 
This issue has been resolved and new guidelines were established with the revision of SRP
Section 3.9.3, “ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 Components, Component Supports, and Core
Support Structures,” in 1981.
The staff’s review of DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.3.4.3, concludes that the applicant’s information is
consistent with the guidelines in SRP Section 3.9.3 regarding snubber operability, and
acceptably addresses the issue of snubber operability.  Section 3.9.3.3 of this report includes
the staff’s review of this issue.  On the basis of this evaluation, the staff concludes that the
guidelines in SRP Section 3.9.3 regarding snubber operability have been met, and Issue A-13
is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-17:  Systems Interactions in Nuclear Power Plants
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-17 addresses concerns about adverse systems
interactions (ASIs) in nuclear power plants.  Depending on how they propagate, ASIs can be
Generic Issues
20-14
classified as functionally coupled, spatially coupled, and induced-human-intervention coupled. 
As discussed in NUREG-1229, “Regulatory Analysis for Resolution of USI A-17,” dated
August 1989, and GL 89-18, “Resolution of Unresolved Safety Issue A-17, Systems Interactions
in Nuclear Power Plants,” dated September 6, 1989, Issue A-17 concerns ASIs caused by
water intrusion, internal flooding, seismic events, and pipe ruptures.
A nuclear power plant is comprised of numerous SSCs that are designed, analyzed, and
constructed using many different engineering disciplines.  The degree of functional and physical
integration of these SSCs into any single power plant may vary considerably.  Concerns have
been raised about the adequacy of this functional and physical integration and the coordination
process.  The Issue A-17 program was initiated to integrate the areas of systems interactions
and to consider viable alternatives for regulatory requirements to ensure that ASIs have been or
will be minimized in operating and new plants.  Within the framework of the program, the staff
requested, as stated in NUREG-0933, that plant designers consider the operating experience
discussed in GL 89-18 and use the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) required for future
plants to identify vulnerability and reduce ASIs.
This issue concerns the need to investigate the potential that unrecognized subtle
dependencies, or systems interactions, among SSCs in a plant could lead to safety-significant
events.  In NUREG-1174, “Evaluation of Systems Interactions in Nuclear Power Plants:
Technical Findings Related to Unresolved Safety Issue A-17,” dated May 1989, intersystem
dependencies are categorized based on the way they propagate into functionally coupled,
spatially coupled, and induced-human-intervention coupled systems interactions.  The
occurrence of an actual ASI or the existence of a potential ASI, as well as the potential overall
safety impact, is a function of an individual plant’s design and operational features.  For the
AP1000 with new or differently configured passive and active systems, a systematic search for
ASIs is necessary.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, Westinghouse stated that the AP600 was the subject of a
systematic evaluation of potential ASIs, as documented in WCAP-14477, “The AP600 Adverse
System Interaction Evaluation Report,” and that the conclusions of WCAP-14477 are applicable
to the AP1000 because the fluid system design for the AP1000 is the same as that used in the
AP600.  However, in response to a staff RAI, the applicant submitted WCAP-15992, “AP1000
Adverse System Interactions Evaluation Report,” dated November 2002, and Revision 1 of this
same report, dated February 2003.
The purpose of WCAP-15992 was to identify possible adverse interactions among
safety-related systems and between safety-related and non-safety-related systems, and to
evaluate the potential consequences of such interactions.  The staff reviewed this issue as part
of the regulatory treatment of non-safety systems (RTNSS) described in Chapter 22 of this
report.
The staff concludes that the applicant has adequately assessed possible ASIs and their
potential consequences in WCAP-15992, Revision 1.  Therefore, Issue A-17 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-15
Issue A-24:  Qualification of Class 1E Safety-Related Equipment
Construction permit (CP) applicants for which safety evaluation reports were issued after July 1,
1974, were required by the NRC to qualify all safety-related equipment to Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Std 323-1974, “IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class 1E
Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations.”  From the time this standard originated, the
industry developed methods that were used to qualify equipment in accordance with the
standard.  The NRC determined that a generic approach was required to assess the adequacy
of the equipment qualification methods and acceptance criteria used by nuclear steam supply
system (NSSS) and balance-of-plant (BOP) vendors.  The staff designated this as Issue A-24 in
NUREG-0933.  This issue was resolved with the publication of NUREG-0588, “Interim Staff
Position on Environmental Qualification of Safety-Related Electrical Equipment,” Revision 1,
dated July 1981.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, the applicant stated that the AP1000 environmental qualification
methodology described in DCD Tier 2, Appendix 3D is founded on the generic Westinghouse 
qualification program approved by the NRC.  The applicant also stated that this methodology
addresses the requirements of GDC 4 and 10 CFR 50.49, “Environmental Qualification of
Electrical Equipment Important to Safety for Nuclear Power Plants,” as well as the guidance of
Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.89, “Environmental Qualification of Certain Electric Equipment
Important to Safety for Nuclear Power Plants,” and IEEE Std 323-1974.
On the basis of its review, which is discussed in Section 3.11 of this report, the staff concludes
that the applicant’s approach to environmental qualification of Class 1E equipment complies
with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.49.  Issue A-24 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-25:  Non-Safety Loads on Class 1E Power Sources
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-25 addresses a review of whether non-safety-related
loads should also be allowed to share Class 1E power sources.  Class 1E power sources
provide the electric power for the plant systems that are essential to reactor shutdown,
containment isolation, reactor core cooling, containment heat removal, and preventing
significant release of radioactive material to the environment.  As discussed in NUREG-0933,
this issue was resolved in Revision 2 to RG 1.75, “Physical Independence of Electric Systems,”
with minor exceptions (see Section 8.3.2.3 of this report).  
The 125-V direct current (dc) emergency lighting in the main control room (MCR) and in the
remote shutdown area is non-Class 1E and is fed from a Class 1E uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) through two series fuses that are coordinated for isolation.  Present regulatory practice
allows the connection of non-safety loads to Class 1E (emergency) power sources if it can be
shown that the connection of non-safety loads will not result in degradation of the Class 1E
system.  In the AP1000 design, either of these fuses is able to interrupt any fault current before
initiation of a trip of any upstream fuse.  No credible failure of non-Class 1E equipment or
systems will degrade the Class 1E system below an acceptable level.
Therefore, Issue A-25 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-16
Issue A-26:  Reactor Vessel Pressure Transient Protection
Since 1972, there have been many reported pressure transients that have exceeded the
pressure and temperature (P/T) limits specified in the TS for PWRs.  The majority of these
events occurred at relatively low reactor vessel temperatures, at which the material has less
toughness and is more susceptible to failure through brittle fracture.  This is Issue A-26 in
NUREG-0933.  This issue was resolved with the issuance of SRP Section 5.2.2, “Overpressure
Protection.”  Applicants for construction permits (CPs) and operating licenses (OLs) were
requested to design an overpressure protection system for LWRs following the guidance
provided in SRP Section 5.2.2.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design conforms to the
criteria in Branch Technical Position (BTP) Reactor Systems Branch (RSB) 5-2,
“Overpressurization Protection of Pressurized-Water Reactors While Operating at Low
Temperatures,” of SRP Section 5.2.2.  The  pressurizer is sized to accommodate most
pressure transients, and overpressure protection for the RCS is provided by either the
pressurizer safety valves during power operation, or the normal residual heat removal (RNS)
relief valve for low-temperature overpressure protection (LTOP), as described in DCD Tier 2,
Section 5.2.2.  Section 5.2.2 of this report provides the staff’s evaluation of the RCS
overpressure protection.
The staff concludes that the AP1000 design satisfies the requirements of BTP RSB 5-2. 
Therefore, Issue A-26 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-28:  Increase in Spent Fuel Pool Storage Capacity
The applicant indicated, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that it considers Issue A-28 to be relevant
to the AP1000 design; however, resolution of this issue is not necessary for the AP1000 design
to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv).
Issue A-28 of NUREG-0933 addresses the development of consistent and formalized
acceptance criteria for the conversion of existing spent fuel storage pools to higher density
storage racks to increase storage capacity.  This issue was resolved with a letter from the NRC
to licensees dated April 17, 1978, which provided in a single document the criteria used by the
staff to evaluate applications for spent fuel pool storage modifications.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design incorporates the NRC
criteria, and the heat load is evaluated for the stated spent fuel storage capacity. 
Section 9.1.2 of this report discusses the staff’s evaluation of the conformance of the AP1000
spent fuel pool design to the NRC criteria.  Based on the staff’s conclusions in this section,
Issue A-28 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-29:  Nuclear Power Plant Design for Reduction of Vulnerability to Industrial Sabotage
Issue A-29 addresses potential methods to reduce vulnerability to sabotage.  The NRC staff
concluded that existing requirements dealing with plant physical security, controlled access to
vital areas, screening for reliable personnel appear to be effective.  This item was resolved with
no new requirements.  
Generic Issues
20-17
Westinghouse stated that the passive systems in the AP1000 design provided to mitigate the
effects of potential accidents may have an inherent advantage when considering potential acts
of sabotage compared to the active systems in operating plants.  Also, the AP1000 design
includes provisions for access control to vital areas.  The provisions for security are discussed
in the AP1000 Security Design Report and outlined in DCD Tier 2, Section 13.6.
The staff determined that this issue was acceptably addressed by the applicant.  For further
information, see resolution of Open Item 13.6-1 in Section 13.6 of this report.  Therefore, the
staff concludes that Issue A-29 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-31:  Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Requirements
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-31 addresses the ability of a plant to transfer heat from
the reactor to the environment after shutdown, which is an important safety function.  This issue
was resolved in 1978 with the issuance of SRP Section 5.4.7, “Residual Heat Removal (RHR)
System.”
The safe shutdown of a nuclear power plant following an accident not related to a LOCA has
typically been interpreted as achieving “hot-standby” condition.  The NRC has placed
considerable emphasis on the hot-standby condition of a power plant in the event of an
accident or other abnormal occurrence, as well as on long-term cooling, which is typically
achieved by the RHR system.  The RHR system starts to operate when the reactor coolant
pressure and temperature are substantially lower than the values for the hot-standby condition. 
Although it may generally be considered safe to maintain a reactor in hot-standby condition for
a long time, experience shows that certain events have occurred that required eventual
cooldown or long-term cooling until the RCS is cold enough for personnel to inspect the
problem and repair it.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design includes passive
safety-related core decay heat removal (DHR) systems that establish and maintain the plant in
a safe-shutdown condition following design-basis events.  The applicant further stated that it is
not necessary that these passive systems achieve cold shutdown as defined in RG 1.139,
“Guidance for Residual Heat Removal.”
The PXS is designed to maintain plant safe-shutdown conditions indefinitely.  A cold-shutdown
condition is only necessary for access to the RCS for inspection, maintenance, or repair.  For
the AP1000 design, cold-shutdown conditions can be achieved using highly reliable, but
non-safety-related systems, which have similar redundancy as current generation safety-related
systems and are supplied with alternating current (ac) power from either onsite or offsite
sources.  DCD Section 5.4.7 discusses the non-safety-related normal RHR system (RNS). 
Section 5.4.7 of this report provides the staff’s evaluation of the RNS.
The applicant stated that the passive RHR system, the capability of which is discussed in DCD
Section 6.3, can achieve hot-standby conditions immediately, and can reduce the reactor
coolant temperature to 215.6 °Celcius (C) (420 °Fahrenheit (F)) within 36 hours.  The reactor
pressure is controlled and can be reduced to 1.72 MegaPascal (MPa) (250 pounds per square
inch gauge (psig)).  The passive RHR system also provides a closed cooling system to maintain
long-term cooling.  Therefore, the AP1000 complies with GDC 34, “Residual Heat Removal,” by
using a more reliable and simplified system for both hot-standby and long-term cooling modes. 
Generic Issues
20-18
Further, it is not necessary that these passive systems achieve cold shutdown, as defined by
RG 1.139.
In GDC 34, the NRC requires an RHR system to be provided with suitable redundancy in
components and features to assure that, with or without onsite or offsite power, it can
accomplish its safety functions so as not to exceed the specified acceptable fuel design limits
and the design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB).  The
safe-shutdown condition for which the RHR system should accomplish this is not defined.  The
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Utility Requirements Document (URD) proposes that
the safe-shutdown condition be defined as 215.6 °C (420 °F) for the passive advanced light-
water reactor (ALWR) designs.  The staff concludes that cold shutdown is not the only safe
stable shutdown condition able to maintain the fuel and RCPB within acceptable limits.  In
SECY-94-084, Section C, “Safe Shutdown Requirements,” the staff recommended, and the
Commission approved, that the EPRI-proposed 215.6 °C (420 °F) criteria or below, rather than
the cold-shutdown condition required by RG 1.139, be accepted as a safe stable condition,
which the passive RHR system must be capable of achieving and maintaining following
non-LOCA events.  This acceptance is predicated on an acceptable passive safety system
performance and an acceptable resolution of the issue of RTNSS.  The SECY paper also states
that the passive safety system capabilities can be demonstrated by appropriate evaluations
during detailed design analyses, including the following two analyses:
(1)
a safety analysis to demonstrate that the passive systems can bring the plant to a safe
stable condition and maintain this condition such that no transients will violate the
specified acceptable fuel design limits and pressure boundary design limit, and that no
high-energy piping failure initiated by this condition will violate the 10 CFR 50.46 criteria
(2)
a probabilistic reliability analysis, including events initiated from the safe-shutdown
conditions, to ensure conformance with the safety goal guidelines and to determine the
reliability/availability missions of risk-significant systems and components as a part of
the effort for RTNSS
Chapters 6 and 15 of this report discuss the performance of the passive system capability. 
Section 19.3 of this report discusses the RTNSS issue in terms of the availability of the RNS
system during shutdown and refueling conditions.  The staff found that the AP1000 design
acceptably addresses both these issues and found them acceptable for AP1000 design. 
Therefore the staff considers Issue A-31 resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-35:  Adequacy of Offsite Power Systems
In GDC 17, “Electronic Power Systems,” the NRC requires that an offsite electric power system
be available to assure that (1) the fuel and reactor boundary are maintained within specified
acceptable limits, and (2) core cooling, containment integrity, and other vital safety functions
are maintained during accident conditions.
The AP1000 design includes an offsite power source; however, the AP1000 design does not
require any offsite ac power source to achieve and maintain safe shutdown.  Therefore, this
issue is not applicable to the AP1000 design.

Issue A-36:  Control of Heavy Loads Near Spent Fuel
At all nuclear plants, overhead cranes are used to lift heavy objects in the vicinity of spent fuel. 
If a heavy object, such as a spent fuel shipping cask or shielding block, were to fall onto spent
fuel in the storage pool or reactor core during refueling and damage the fuel, radioactivity could
be released to the environment.  Such an event would also create the potential for
overexposing plant personnel to radiation.  If the dropped object were large and the damaged
fuel contained a considerable amount of undecayed fission products, radiation releases to the
environment could exceed the exposure guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100, “Reactor Site Criteria.” 
With the advent of increased and longer term storage of spent fuel, the NRC determined that a
need existed for a systematic review of requirements, facility designs, and TS regarding the
movement of heavy loads to assess safety margins and improve them where necessary.  The
staff designated this as Issue A-36 in NUREG-0933.
The issue was resolved with the publication of NUREG-0612, “Control of Heavy Loads at
Nuclear Power Plants Resolution of Generic Technical Activity A-36,” dated July 1980, and SRP
Section 9.1.5, “Overhead Heavy Load Handling Systems.”
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design conforms to
NUREG-0612 and Section 9.1.5 of the SRP.  DCD Tier 2, Section 9.1.4, describes the
light-load handling systems, and DCD Tier 2, Section 9.1.5, discusses the overhead heavy-load
handling systems.
Sections 9.1.4 and 9.1.5 of this report present the staff’s evaluation of the conformance of the
AP1000 design to NUREG-0612 and Section 9.1.5 of the SRP.  Based on the staff’s
conclusions in these sections, Issue A-36 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-40:  Seismic Design Criteria
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-40 addresses short-term improvements in seismic
design criteria.  The objectives of Issue A-40 include the following:

investigate selected areas of the seismic design sequence to determine their
conservatism for all types of sites

investigate alternative approaches, when desirable

quantify the overall conservatism of the design sequence

modify the NRC criteria in the SRP, when justified
This issue was initiated in 1978 to identify and quantify conservatism in the seismic design
process, and to develop a basis for revising SRP Section 3.7 on seismic design analyses.
To resolve this issue, the staff revised SRP Sections 2.5.2, “Vibratory Ground Motion,” 3.7.1,
“Seismic Design Parameters,” 3.7.2, “Seismic System Analysis,” and 3.7.3, “Seismic
Subsystem Analysis,” to address areas of vibratory ground motion; design time-history criteria;
development of floor response criteria, damping values, and soil-structure interaction (SSI)
uncertainties; and the combination of modal responses.  The revisions also addressed seismic

analysis of the aboveground tanks and Category 1 buried piping.  The revised SRP Section 3.7
provides guidelines for the (1) site-specific ground response spectra, (2) justification of the use
of single synthetic ground motion time-history by power spectral density function, (3) basis for
location and limitation of input ground motion reduction for SSI analysis, and (4) design of
aboveground vertical tanks and buried piping.
In DCD Tier 2, Sections 2.5.2.1 and 2.5.4.5, the applicant stated that the COL applicant
referencing the AP1000 design will perform a site-specific evaluation and will demonstrate the
acceptability of the AP1000 design to the site-specific characteristics.  On the basis of its
evaluation discussed in Sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.4 of this report, the staff concludes that it is
acceptable for the COL applicant to perform site-specific evaluations of seismic and
geotechnical characteristics.
An acceptable resolution of Issue A-40 is that future nuclear power plants should conform to the
seismic design guidance of Revision 2 to SRP Sections 2.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and 3.7.3.  The
AP1000 response to Issue A-40 in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, references the criteria and
methodology described in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.7, as the basis for resolving this issue. 
Sections 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and 3.7.3 of this report discuss the staff’s review of DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.7.  On the basis of its evaluations in these sections, the staff concludes that the
AP1000 design is consistent with the guidelines in Revision 2 of SRP Sections 2.5.2, 3.7.1,
3.7.2, and 3.7.3.  Therefore, Issue A-40 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-43:  Containment Emergency Sump Performance
Issue A-43 concerns the availability of adequate cooling water following a LOCA when
long-term recirculation from the PWR containment sump or the boiling-water reactor (BWR)
emergency core cooling system (ECCS) suction intake is required to provide core cooling.  The
recirculation cooling water must be sufficiently free of LOCA-generated debris and ingested air
so that pump performance is not impaired, thereby degrading long-term recirculation flow
capability.  Further information concerning Issue A-43 and its resolution may be found in
GL 85-22, “Potential For Loss of Post-LOCA Recirculation Capability Due to Insulation Debris
Blockage.”
Section 6.2.1.8 of this report discusses the staff’s evaluation of the adequacy of the IRWST and
the containment recirculation screens.  On the basis of its evaluation, the staff considers this
issue to be resolved for the AP1000 design because the applicant adequately addressed the
sump performance concerns related to Issue A-43.
Issue A-44:  Station Blackout (SBO)
Issue A-44 was resolved with the publication of 10 CFR 50.63, “Loss of All Alternating Current
Power,” which provides requirements that LWRs be able to withstand for a specified duration
and recover from an SBO.  It addresses the likelihood of the loss of all ac power at the site, and
the potential for severe core damage after the SBO.
In DCD Tier 2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not require ac electrical power
to establish or maintain a plant in safe-shutdown condition.  However, the design includes two
redundant, non-Class 1E diesel generators (DGs) to provide electrical power for non-safety-
related active systems that provide a defense-in-depth function.  The non-Class 1E DGs are
Generic Issues
20-21
identified as risk-significant in the scope of the design-reliability assurance program (D-RAP)
described in DCD Tier 2, Section 17.4, and submitted to the NRC on October 3, 1996.  DCD
Tier 2, Table 17.4-1, “Risk Significant SSCs Under the Scope of D-RAP,” lists non-Class 1E
DGs as RTNSS important.  Section 8.5.2.3 of this report discusses the resolution of the RTNSS
issue. Therefore, Issue A-44 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-46:  Seismic Qualification of Equipment in Operating Plants
Issue A-46 addresses the need to establish an explicit set of guidelines to verify the seismic
adequacy of mechanical and electrical equipment at older operating plants instead of backfitting
the current design criteria for new plants.  Requirements for resolution of this issue were
included in GL 87-02, “Verification of Seismic Adequacy of Mechanical and Electrical
Equipment in Operating Plants, Unresolved Safety Issue (USI) A-46,” issued on February 19,
1987.
DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, states that this issue is applicable to operating plants, and not to
plants to be constructed.  Therefore, Issue A-46 does not apply to the AP1000, which is
designed in accordance with current seismic qualification (not verification) requirements.  DCD
Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, also states that the seismic Category I mechanical and electrical
equipment in the AP1000 design will be qualified in accordance with the AP1000 qualification
methodology discussed in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.10.  Section 3.10 of this report includes the
staff’s review of this seismic qualification methodology.  Based on its review of this information,
the staff agrees that Issue A-46 is not applicable to the AP1000 design.
Issue A-47:  Safety Implications of Control Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-47 concerns the potential for accidents or transients to
become more severe as a result of control systems failures, including power supply faults.  In
evaluating this issue, the staff performed an in-depth review of non-safety-related control
systems and assessed the effect of control system failures on plant safety.
Non-safety-grade control systems are not relied on to perform any safety functions, but they are
used to control plant processes that could have a significant impact on plant dynamics.  To
resolve Issue A-47, the NRC evaluated the effects of control system failures on PWR reference
plants, including a design subjected to single and multiple control system failures during
automatic and manual modes of operation.  The staff’s two concerns related to the design
included (1) SG overfill, and (2) reactor core heat removal to cold shutdown after an SB LOCA,
without overcooling the reactor vessel.  The NRC issued GL 89-19, “Request for Action Related
to Resolution of USI A-47, Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54(f),” dated September 20, 1989, which
required all operating PWR plants and plants under construction to provide the following:

automatic protection from SG overfill by the main feedwater system (MFWS) and
separate from the MFWS control system

plant procedures and TS surveillance requirements (SRs) to periodically verify the
operability of the overfill protection during power operation
Generic Issues
20-22
The resolution of Issue A-47 requires that the plant have, as a minimum, control-grade
protection against SG overfill by the MFWS, and TS and plant operating procedures to ensure
in-service verification of the availability of the overfill protection, in accordance with GL 89-19.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that control system failures are
considered as potential initiating events for the AP1000 design.  The analyses of transients
resulting from these failures demonstrated that the consequences are bounded by American
Nuclear Society (ANS) Condition II criteria, and no design-basis failure for a control system is
expected to violate this criteria.
The applicant stated that the integrated control system for the AP1000 design obtains certain of
its control input signals from signals used in the integrated protection system.  With the
integrated control and protection system, functional independence of the control and protection
systems is maintained by providing a signal selection device in the control system for those
signals used in the protection system.  The purpose of this device is to prevent a failed signal,
caused by the failure of a protection channel, from resulting in a control action that could lead to
a plant condition requiring that protective action.  The signal selection device provides this
capability by comparing the redundant signals and automatically eliminating an aberrant signal
from being used in the control system.  This capability exists for bypassed sensors or for
sensors whose signals diverge from the expected error tolerance.
The AP1000 plant control system incorporates design features, such as redundancy, automatic
testing, and self-diagnostics, to prevent challenges to the protection and safety monitoring
systems.  DCD Tier 2, Chapter 7, provides a discussion of the AP1000 instrumentation and
controls.
In DCD Tier 2, Sections 7.2.1.1.6, 7.3.1.2.6, and 7.7.1.8, and Figure 7.2-1, sheet 10, the
applicant addressed the feedwater isolation function (SG overfill protection).  The protection is
provided by a safety-grade SG high-water-level (High-2) signal with a two-out-of-four initiating
logic.  The plant control system uses a lower SG water level setpoint, High-1, to close the
feedwater control valves.  This provides an interval for operator action to prevent total isolation
of the SG and reactor trip before the safety-grade High-2 setpoint is exceeded.  The safety-
grade signal closes the MFWS control valves and isolation valves.  This is provided in the RTS
logic, which is sufficiently separated from the MFWS control system.  The AP1000 TS 3.3.1,
“Reactor Trip System Instrumentation,” and TS 3.7.3, “Main Feedwater Isolation and Control
Valves,” in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 16, adequately address the SRs to verify the operability of the
SG overfill protection.  Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue A-47 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue A-48:  Hydrogen Control Measures and Effects of Hydrogen Burns on Safety Equipment
The AP1000 DSER regarding Issue A-48 stated the following:
This issue remains open because DCD Tier 2 does not comply with current regulations
for the control of combustible gas in containment during accidents.
The NRC has proposed major changes to 10 CFR 50.44, “Standards for Combustible
Gas Control System in Light-Water-Cooled Power Reactors,” and related changes to
10 CFR 50.34 and 10 CFR 52.47, along with the creation of a new rule, 10 CFR 50.46a. 
Generic Issues
20-23
(See Volume 67 of the Federal Register, p.50374 (67 FR 50374), dated August 2,
2002.)  These proposed changes, which constitute significant relaxations in the
requirements, are meant to make the combustible gas control requirements risk
informed.  The staff plans to finalize the rule changes during 2003.
The applicant wrote DCD Tier 2 was in anticipation of these rule changes.  As such, it is
not in compliance with the current, more restrictive regulations.  Furthermore, until the
proposed rule changes are final and effective, the staff cannot know for certain if the
DCD will comply with the revised rule.  Therefore, the issue of containment combustible
gas control, as well as Issue A-48, must remain open at this time.  This is Open
Item 6.2.5-1.
Subsequent to the publication of the DSER, the NRC revised its regulations regarding the
control of combustible gas in containment.  The revised regulations were published on
September 16, 2003, and became effective on October 16, 2003.  The NRC has extensively
revised 10 CFR 50.44, “Combustible Gas Control for Nuclear Power Reactors,” made
associated changes to Subsections 50.34 and 52.47, and added a new section,
Subsection 50.46a, “Acceptance Criteria for Reactor Coolant System Venting Systems.”  The
revisions apply to current power reactor licensees, and also consolidate combustible gas control
regulations for future power reactor applicants and licensees.  The revised rules eliminate the
requirements for hydrogen recombiners and hydrogen purge systems, and relax the
requirements for hydrogen and oxygen monitoring equipment to make them commensurate
with their risk significance.
The ability of the AP1000 design to comply with the hydrogen control requirements of 10 CFR
50.44 is documented in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.4.  The staff’s evaluation of the ability of the
AP1000 design to comply with the hydrogen control requirements of 10 CFR 50.44 are
documented in Section 6.2.5 of this report.
Concerning equipment survivability, Westinghouse addressed this issue in DCD Tier 2,
Appendix 19D and in Appendix D to the AP1000 PRA, and the staff’s evaluation is documented
in Section 19.2.3.3.7 of this report.
On the basis of the staff's evaluation, as documented in Sections 6.2.5 and 19.2.3.3.7 of this
report, Open Item 6.2.5-1 is closed and Issue A-48 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue A-49:  Pressurized Thermal Shock
Pressurized thermal shock (PTS) occurs in PWRs because unanticipated transients or design-
basis postulated accidents could result in severe overcooling (thermal shock) of the RPV
concurrent with, or followed by, repressurization.  In these events, rapid cooling of the internal
surfaces of the reactor vessel results in thermal stresses with a maximum thermal tensile stress
at the inside surface.  The magnitude of the thermal stress depends on the temperature profile
across the vessel wall as a function of time.  If the vessel is pressurized, the pressure stress
can compound the effects of this thermal stress.
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue A-49 addresses the concern that neutron irradiation of the
RPV weld and plate materials decreases the fracture toughness of the materials.  Decreased
fracture toughness makes it more likely that if a severe overcooling event occurs followed by, or
Generic Issues
20-24
concurrent with, high vessel pressure, and if a small crack is present on the vessel’s inner
surface, that crack could grow to a size that might threaten the integrity of the vessel.  The staff
is concerned about the possibility of vessel failure as a result of a severe pressurized
overcooling event, or PTS.  As long as the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel material is
relatively high, such events are not expected to cause vessel failure.  However, the fracture
toughness decreases during the operating life of a nuclear power plant from the fast neutron
flux.  The rate of decrease is dependent on the chemical composition of the material and the
amount of irradiation.  If the fracture toughness has been reduced significantly, severe high-
pressure, low-temperature events could cause propagation of small flaws that could exist near
the inner surface of the vessel.  The assumed initial flaw might propagate into a crack through
the vessel wall to threaten vessel integrity and core cooling capability.
This issue was resolved and the staff established new requirements in 10 CFR 50.61, “Fracture
Toughness Requirements for Protection against Pressurized Thermal Shock Events.”  This rule
establishes screening criteria that are related to the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel.
The risk from P/T events is acceptably low for reactor vessel materials that are projected to be
below the PTS screening criteria.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design complies with the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.61.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.3.4, discusses reactor vessel integrity
for the AP1000 design.  Material requirements and P/T limits are discussed in DCD Tier 2,
Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.
The staff’s evaluation of this issue, discussed in Section 5.3.4 of this report, concluded that the
reactor vessel beltline materials proposed for the AP1000 design are projected to be below the
screening criteria in 10 CFR 50.61.  Compliance with this rule is an acceptable basis for
resolving this issue.  Therefore, Issue A-49 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-5:  Ductility of Two-Way Slabs and Shells and Buckling Behavior of Steel Containments
In NUREG-0933, this issue was divided into the following two parts, which were evaluated
separately:
Part I—Ductility of Two-Way Slabs and Shells
Part I of Issue B-5 was defined in NUREG-0471, “Generic Task Problem Descriptions
(Categories B, C, and D),” dated June 1978, which addressed the lack of information related to
the behavior of two-way, reinforced concrete slabs loaded dynamically in biaxial tension,
flexure, and shear.  This issue recognized the need to develop design requirements for
concrete two-way slabs to resist loading caused by a LOCA or a high-energy line break (HELB). 
As described below, an acceptable resolution to this issue consists of applying two-way,
reinforced concrete slab analysis methods to adequately address dynamic loading in biaxial
membrane tension, flexure, and shear due to a LOCA or HELB.
Part II—Buckling Behavior of Steel Containments
Part II of Issue B-5 was also identified in NUREG-0471 and addresses the lack of a well-defined
approach for evaluating the design of steel containment vessels subject to asymmetrical
dynamic loadings that may be limited by the instability of the shell.  Adequately addressing the
Generic Issues
20-25
design loads, the asymmetrical vessel configurations associated with the presence of
equipment hatches, and the factor of safety in determining allowable loadings represents an
acceptable resolution of this issue, as described below.
With respect to Part I of this issue, Westinghouse stated in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.8.4.3.1.4,
that pressure and thermal loads within or across a compartment (such as the main steam
isolation valve and SG blowdown compartments) are generated on the basis of a postulated
HELB.  The DCD also states that for structural elements, including compartment walls and floor
slabs, the analysis and design of concrete elements (reinforced concrete structural elements
and steel structural modules) conform to the American Concrete Institute (ACI) ACI-349 code. 
The use of the ACI-349 code, which provides design criteria and design procedures for the
design of reinforced concrete walls and floor slabs under bending and biaxial tension, is
acceptable to the staff, as discussed in Section 3.8.4 of this report.  On this basis, the staff
concludes that the concern of Issue B-5, Part I is resolved.
As for Part II of this issue, DCD Tier 2, Section 3.8.2.4.1.1, states that the buckling evaluation
under external pressure used the criteria in ASME Code, Section III, paragraph NE-3133,
“Components Under External Loading.”  The potential buckling under overall seismic loads was
evaluated in accordance with ASME Code, Case N-284, Revision 1.  Section 3.8.2 of this report
discusses the staff’s evaluation and conclusions for the containment shell buckling under
various loads and combined load conditions.  This section identified two open items (Open
Items 3.8.2.1-1 and 3.8.2.2-1).  Open Items 3.8.2.1-1 and 3.8.2.2-1 in the DSER were related to
this issue.  Both of these open items are now resolved.  The resolution of these open items are
included in Sections 3.8.2.1 and 3.8.2.2, respectively, of this report.  On this basis, the staff
concludes that the concern of Issue B-5, Part II is resolved.
Issue B-5 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-17:  Criteria for Safety-Related Operator Actions
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-17 involves the development of a time criterion for
safety-related operator actions (SROAs), including a determination of whether automatic
actuation is required.  This issue also concerns PWR designs that require manual operations to
accomplish the switchover from the injection mode to the recirculation mode following a LOCA. 
Current plant designs require the operator to take action in response to certain transients. 
Consequently, it becomes necessary to develop appropriate criteria for SROAs.  The criteria
would include a method to determine those actions that should be automated in lieu of operator
actions and development of a time criterion for SROAs.  
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/ANS 58.8-1984, “Time Response Design Criteria
for Nuclear Safety Related Operator Actions,” includes the review criteria for this issue.  Plants
should perform task analysis, simulator studies, and analysis and evaluation of operational data
to assess whether the plants’ engineered safety features (ESFs) and safety-related control
system designs conform to the review criteria.  Where nonconformance is identified,
modification of the design and hardware may be required.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the
applicant stated that for the AP1000 design, the safety-related actions required to protect the
plant during design-basis events are automatically initiated.  The plant systems are designed to
provide the required information to the operator so that plant conditions can be monitored and
the performance of the safety-related passive systems and the non-safety-related active
Generic Issues
20-26
systems can be evaluated.  The non-safety-related active systems are designed to
automatically actuate, provide defense-in-depth for plant events, and preclude unnecessary
actuation of the safety-related passive systems.  A backup manual initiation exists for both the
passive and active systems.  
As described in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 15, the safety systems maintain the plant in a safe
condition following design-basis events.  Issue A-31, above, discusses this in more detail.  For
most design-basis events, this is accomplished without operator action for up to 72 hours. 
Operator action is stated to be planned and expected during plant events to achieve the most
effective plant response consistent with the event conditions and equipment availability.  For
events where operator action is taken, the plant design maximizes the time available for
operators to complete required actions.  For example, the applicant stated that during an SG
tube rupture, no operator action is required to establish safe-shutdown conditions or prevent SG
overfill.  As indicated in Section 18.3 of this report, WCAP-14645, Revision 2, “Human Factors
Engineering Operating Experience Review Report for the AP600 Nuclear Power Plant,”
satisfactorily addresses this item.  The applicant has demonstrated that WCAP-14645 is
applicable to the AP1000 design and staff has agreed.  Therefore, Issue B-17 is resolved for
the AP1000 design.
Issue B-22:  LWR Fuel
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-22 addresses the staff’s concern that individual reactor
fuel rods sometimes fail during normal operations, and that many fuel rods are expected to fail
during severe core accidents.  Failure of fuel rods results in radioactive releases within a plant
and is a potential source of release to the public.  The resolution of this issue is to ensure that
these fuel failures do not result in unacceptable releases to the public.  Several problems were
identified in the staff analysis to improve the predictability of fuel performance, which were then
addressed in the revision to SRP Section 4.2, “Fuel System Design,” in 1981.  Further, fuel
manufactures have taken an active role in resolving this issue since it was identified.  As a
result, fuel failures are now rare and the significance of this issue has been diminished. 
Therefore, the staff concluded that the then-existing requirements on fuel were adequate to
ensure continued low fuel defect rates, and additional requirements would not significantly
increase the number of fuel defects.  As a result, the issue was dropped from further
consideration.
In DCD Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 reactor core design complies
with SRP Section 4.2.  DCD Tier 2, Section 4.2, discusses the fuel system design.
The staff completed its review of the AP1000 fuel assembly design described in DCD
Section 4.2, which is similar to the 17x17 and 17x17 XL robust fuel assemblies.  Section 4.2 of
this report discusses the details of fuel design and acceptance criteria.  Issue B-22 is resolved
for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-29:  Effectiveness of Ultimate Heat Sinks
The applicant indicated in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that it considers Issue B-29 to be relevant to
the AP1000 design; however, resolution of this issue is not necessary for the AP1000 design to
meet the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv).
Generic Issues
20-27
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-29 addresses the staff’s concerns, identified in
NUREG-0471, that the validity of the mathematical models used to predict the performance of
dedicated ponds, spray ponds, and cooling towers had not been confirmed, and that better
guidance was needed regarding the criteria for selecting weather data to define the
design-basis meteorology.  Issues 51, 130, and 153 in Section 20.3 of this report address this
issue and the need for further improvement to the design and operation of ultimate heat sinks
(UHS).  More specifically, this issue concerns confirming the validity of the NRC mathematical
models for predicting UHS performance and providing guidance regarding the criteria for
weather record selection to define UHS design-basis meteorology.  This issue was resolved by
staff studies which confirmed the capabilities of the NRC models and provided assurance that
the existing guidance was adequate.  No new requirements were issued.  However, the
adequacy of the models to simulate the performance of a plant-specific UHS must be justified
on a case-by-case basis.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the passive containment cooling
system for the AP1000 design complies with SRP Section 9.2.5, “Ultimate Heat Sink,” by
providing passive decay heat removal that transfers heat to the atmosphere, which is the UHS
for accident conditions.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.2, describes the passive containment cooling
system.
Section 6.2.2 of this report discusses the staff’s evaluation of the conformance of the AP1000
design to Section 9.2.5 of the SRP.  Based on the staff’s conclusions in that section, Issue B-29
is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-32:  Ice Effects on Safety-Related Water Supplies
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant indicated that it considers Issue B-32 to be relevant to
the AP1000 design; however, resolution of this issue is not necessary for the AP1000 design to
meet the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv).
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-32 addresses the staff’s concerns identified in
NUREG-0471 regarding the need for additional information about the potential effects of
extreme cold weather and ice buildup on the reliability of plant water supplies to confirm that the
design and operation of safety-related water supplies can ensure adequate operation of safety
systems.  SRP Section 2.4.7, “Ice Effects,” offers guidance for the review of licensee submittals
regarding ice effects.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.2, describes
the UHS design and discusses the features that prevent freezing in the passive containment
cooling system.  This issue was addressed and resolved through the resolution of Issue 153,
which is discussed in Section 20.3 of this report.  Therefore, on the basis of the staff’s
conclusions in this section, Issue B-32 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-36:  Develop Design, Testing, and Maintenance Criteria for Atmosphere Cleanup
System Air Filtration and Adsorption Units for Engineered Safety Features
Systems and for Normal Ventilation Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-36 addresses the staff’s concern that the then-current
guidance and staff technical positions regarding ESF and normal ventilation system air filtration
Generic Issues
20-28
and adsorption units needed to be revised.  This issue was resolved by the issuance of
RG 1.52, “Design, Testing, and Maintenance for Postaccident Engineered-Safety-Feature
Atmospheric Cleanup System Air Filtration and Adsorption Units of Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear
Power Plants,” Revision 3 in June 2001 (for EST ventilation filter units), and RG 1.140, “Design,
Testing, and Maintenance Criteria for Normal Ventilation Exhaust System Air Filtration and
Adsorption Units for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Plants,” Revision 2 in June 2001, for
normal atmosphere cleanup systems.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that there are no safety-related air
filtration systems in the AP1000 design.  The specific functions of the normal ventilation
systems are outlined in DCD Tier 2, Sections 6.4 and 9.4.1, with a discussion about the
conformance of the AP1000 design with RG 1.140 found in DCD Tier 2, Appendix 1A.  
The staff determined that Issue B-36 is closed for the AP1000 design because the nuclear
island nonradioactive ventilation system (VBS) and the containment air filtration system (VFS)
conform to RG 1.140.  For the defense-in-depth filtration function of the VBS and VFS,
DCD Tier 2, Appendix 1A compares the AP1000 design to the guidelines of RG 1.140.  In
addition, DCD Tier 2, Section 9.4, provides direct reference to DCD Tier 2, Appendix 1A. 
Therefore, Issue B-36 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-53:  Load Break Switch
GDC 17 requires that two offsite circuits be available to supply vital plant loads following a loss
of all onsite ac power supplies.  For those plants with designs that rely on a generator load
break switch (or circuit breaker), the switch (or breaker) is required to isolate the main
generator from the main transformer following a turbine trip to allow power to be fed from the
grid through the main transformer as a second offsite power source to the onsite Class 1E
power system.
The AP1000 design incorporates a generator load circuit breaker to provide a reliable source of
ac power to the electrical systems; however, the AP1000 design does not require ac power
sources for any safety-related functions to mitigate design-basis accidents. 
Therefore, Issue B-53 is not applicable to the AP1000 design.
Issue B-56:  Diesel Reliability
Issues that result in a LOOP necessitate reliance on the onsite emergency DGs for successful
accident mitigation.  Improving the starting reliability of onsite emergency DGs can reduce the
probability of events that could lead to a core-melt accident.  
The AP1000 design does not required ac power for accident mitigation.  Therefore, the AP1000
DGs are non-Class 1E and their reliability is founded on industry standards and practices.  
Therefore, Issue B-56 is not applicable to the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-29
Issue B-60:  Loose Parts Monitoring System
The presence of a loose object in the primary coolant system can indicate degraded reactor
safety resulting from failure or deterioration of a safety-related component.  As discussed in
NUREG-0933, Issue B-60 addresses the need to have a loose parts detection program for early
detection of loose metallic parts in the primary system.  The NRC has developed hardware
criteria, as well as programmatic criteria, for loose parts detection programs, as described in
RG 1.133, “Loose-Part Detection Program for the Primary System of Light-Water-Cooled
Reactors,” Revision 1.  All CPs and OLs reviewed after January 1, 1978, are required to meet
the provisions of RG 1.133, Revision 1.  Thus, this issue was resolved and no new
requirements were established.
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant indicated that Issue B-60 was resolved with no new
requirements.  As described in DCD Section 4.4.6.4, the AP1000 design has a digital metal
impact monitoring system (DMIMS), which conforms to RG 1.133, for monitoring the RCS for
metallic loose parts.  Section 4.4.4.2 of this report discusses the staff’s evaluation of the
AP1000 DMIMS.  Based on analysis in Section 4.4.4.2 of this report, the staff concludes that
Issue B-60 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue B-61:  Allowable ECCS Equipment Outage Periods
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-61 addresses the need to establish surveillance test
intervals and allowable equipment outage periods, using analytically based criteria and methods
for the TS.  The present TS-allowable equipment outage intervals and test intervals were
determined primarily on engineering judgment.  Studies performed by the NRC on operating
reactors indicate that from 30 to 80 percent of the ECCS unavailability was the result of testing,
maintenance, and allowed outage periods.  Therefore, by optimizing the allowed outage period
and the test and maintenance interval, the equipment unavailability and public risk can be
reduced. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, Westinghouse stated that the AP1000 surveillance test
intervals and allowable outage times help to meet plant safety goals, while maximizing plant
availability and operability.  In determining these limits for the AP1000 TS, the staff considered
a combination of NUREG-1431, “Standard Technical Specifications Westinghouse Plants,”
precedent, system design, and safety-related function.
Chapter 16 of this report presents the staff’s evaluation of the AP1000 TS.  On the basis of this
evaluation and the above, Issue B-61 is resolved for the AP1000  design.
Issue B-63:  Isolation of Low-Pressure Systems Connected to the Reactor Coolant Pressure
        Boundary (RCPB)
Issue B-63 addresses the adequacy of the isolation of low-pressure systems that are connected
to the RCPB.  Design pressures in several systems connected to the RCPB in operating plants
are considerably below the RCS operating pressure.  The NRC has recommended that the
valves forming the interface between these high- and low-pressure systems associated with the
RCPB have sufficient redundancy to ensure that the low-pressure systems are not subjected to
pressures beyond their design limits.
Generic Issues
20-30
Resolution of this issue for the AP1000 has been subsumed by the resolution of Issue 105,
which is discussed in Section 20.3 of this report.  Therefore, Issue B-63 is resolved for the
AP1000 design. 
Issue B-66:  Control Room Infiltration Measurements
The staff reviewed the control room area ventilation systems and control building layout and
structures to ensure that plant operators will be adequately protected against the effects of
accidental releases of toxic and radioactive gases, and that the control room can be maintained
as the backup center from which technical personnel can safely operate during an accident.  A
key parameter affecting control room habitability is the rate of air infiltration into the control
room.  Current estimates of these rates are dependent on data relating to buildings that are
substantially different from typical control room buildings in nuclear power plants.
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue B-66 was intended to facilitate compliance with staff
requirements and guidance on control room habitability, specifically (1) GDC 19, “Control
Room,” and (2) SRP Sections 6.4, “Control Room Habitability System,” and 9.4.1, “Control
Room Area Ventilation System.”  Additional, experimentally measured air exchange rates of
operating reactor control rooms resulted in SRP Section 6.4, Revision 2.  (For further
information on this issue, see the resolution of Issues 83 and III.D.3.4 for the AP1000 design in
Sections 20.3 and 20.4, respectively, of this report.)
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the MCR for the AP1000 design is
essentially leaktight.  Unfiltered air in-leakage is minimized by maintaining the MCR at a slightly
positive pressure, and the verification of the design infiltration rate is in accordance with SRP
Section 6.4.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4, discusses control room habitability.
In DCD Tier 2, Sections 6.4.5.1 and 14.2.9.1.6, the applicant committed to performing
preoperational testing for in-leakage during MCR emergency habitability system (VES)
operation in accordance with American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) E741-2000,
“Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas
Dilution.”  In addition, in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.5.4, the applicant committed to conducting
testing for MCR in-leakage during VES operation in accordance with ASTM E741-2000.  DCD
Tier 2, Section 6.4.7, states that the COL applicant will provide the testing frequency for the
MCR in-leakage test.  This is COL Action Item 6.4-1.  The staff considers Issue B-66 to be
resolved because the testing described above will ensure that the AP1000 design meets the
dose limits of GDC 19.
Issue C-1:    Assurance of Continuous Long-Term Capability of Hermetic Seals on
Instrumentation and Electrical Equipment
Issue C-1 was developed because of concerns regarding the long-term capability of
hermetically-sealed instruments and equipment which must function in postaccident
environments.  When safety-related components within containment must function during post-
LOCA accident conditions, their operability is sensitive to the ingress of steam or water.  As
discussed in the resolution of Issue A-24 above, the AP1000 equipment qualification (EQ)
methodology was reviewed by the staff and found to meet applicable regulations and criteria. 
This methodology confirms the integrity of the seals employed in the design of Class 1E
equipment.  Therefore, Issue C-1 is resolved for the AP1000 design. 
Generic Issues
20-31
Issue C-4:  Statistical Methods for ECCS Analysis
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue C-4 addresses the statistical methods used for evaluating
the performance of the ECCS during a LOCA.  In accordance with the requirements of
10 CFR 50.46, “Acceptance Criteria for ECCS for Light-Water Nuclear Power Reactors,” as
amended on September 16, 1988, the NRC requires that the LOCA analyses for license
applications use either the evaluation models found in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K, “ECCS
Evaluation Models,” or realistic models which statistically account for uncertainties, including the
uncertainty of calculation in the adverse direction.  These realistic models must be supported by
applicable experimental data.  Uncertainties in the realistic models and input must be identified
and assessed so that uncertainty in the calculated results can be estimated.
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K, specifies the requirements for LWR ECCS analysis, which call for
specific conservatism to be applied to certain models and correlations used in the analysis to
account for data uncertainties at the time Appendix K was written.  Issue C-4 addresses the
NRC’s development of a statistical assessment of the uncertainty level of the peak cladding
temperature limit.  In 1988, 10 CFR 50.46 was revised to allow the use of the realistic ECCS
evaluation model, in addition to the evaluation model conforming to the Appendix K
requirements.  This best-estimate evaluation model employs an analytical technique that
realistically describes the behavior of the reactor system during a LOCA, with comparisons to
applicable experimental data.  The realistic evaluation model must identify and account for
uncertainties in the analysis method and inputs so that when the calculated ECCS cooling
performance is compared to the acceptance criteria, there is a high level of probability that the
criteria would not be exceeded.
In DCD Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 methodology applied for LOCA
analysis is discussed in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 15.
As described in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 15, the computer codes WCOBRA/TRAC and NOTRUMP,
respectively, are used for the large- and small-break LOCA analyses.  WCOBRA/TRAC is a
realistic code, and the uncertainties will be included in the analysis.  NOTRUMP is a code using
the Appendix K requirements.  The staff provides its evaluation of the acceptability of these
codes for the AP1000 application in Chapter 21 of this report.  Therefore, Issue C-4 is resolved
for the AP1000 design.
Issue C-5:  Decay Heat Update
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue C-5 addresses the specific decay heat models for the
LOCA analysis models.  This issue involves following the work of research groups in
determining best-estimate decay heat data and associated uncertainties for use in LOCA
calculations.
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.46, as amended on September 16, 1988,
the LOCA analyses for license applications should use either the models included in
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K, or the realistic models supported by applicable experimental data
and including uncertainty of calculation in the adverse direction.  To use the Appendix K models
requires that the 1971 ANS Standard, ANS-5, “Decay Energy Release Rates Following
Shutdown of Uranium-Fueled Thermal Reactors,” be multiplied by a factor of 1.2, to determine
the heat generation rates from the radioactive decay of fission products in the ECCS

calculation.  When realistic models are used, the staff has determined that the 1979 ANSI/ANS
Standard 5.1, “Decay Heat Power in Light-Water Reactors,” is technically acceptable for
licensing applications.
In DCD Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the large-break LOCA analyses for the
AP1000 design, discussed in DCD Section 15.6.5, use the decay heat model identified in the
1979 ANSI/ANS Standard 5.1.
For the AP1000 application, the 1971 ANS decay heat model and the 1979 ANSI/ANS decay
heat model are used in NOTRUMP and WCOBRA/TRAC, respectively, for small- and
large-break LOCAs.  The staff has completed and documented its review of small- and large-
break LOCA analyses using NOTRUMP and WCOBRA/TRAC, respectively, in Chapter 15 of
this report.  The staff considers Issue C-5 resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue C-6:  LOCA Heat Sources
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue C-6 addresses the issue identified in NUREG-0471
involving the staff evaluations of vendors’ data and approaches for determining LOCA heat
sources, as well as the need for developing staff positions.  The contributors to LOCA heat
sources, along with their associated uncertainties and the manner in which they are combined,
have an impact on LOCA calculations.  The staff informed the Commission in SECY-83-472,
“Emergency Core Cooling System Analysis Methods,” dated November 17, 1983, that the
statistical combination of LOCA heat sources could be used to justify the relaxation of non-
required conservatism in ECCS evaluation models.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the discussion of LOCA heat sources
for the AP1000 design is included in DCD Section 15.6.5.  The staff completed and
documented its review of small- and large-break LOCA analyses using NOTRUMP and
WCOBRA/TRAC, respectively, in Chapter 15 of this report.  The staff considers Issue C-6
resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue C-10:  Effective Operation of Containment Sprays in a LOCA
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue C-10 addresses the effectiveness of various containment
sprays to remove airborne radioactive material that could be present within the containment
following a LOCA.  This issue was expanded to include the possible damage to equipment
located within the containment as a result of an inadvertent actuation of the sprays.
The AP1000 relies on natural mechanisms, which are enhanced by the passive containment
system (PCS), for the removal of airborne radioactive material post-LOCA.  Section 15.3 of this
report includes the staff’s evaluation of these natural removal mechanisms (such as holdup,
sedimentation, and diffusion).  In an SRM, dated June 30, 1997, concerning SECY-97-044,
“Policy and Key Technical Issues Pertaining to the Westinghouse AP600 Standardized Passive
Reactor Design,” the Commission approved the staff’s recommendation that the AP600 include
a containment spray system or equivalent for accident management following a severe
accident.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.5.2, describes the containment spray system;
Section 19.2.3.3.9 of this report provides the staff’s evaluation of this system.  The applicant
concluded in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.5.2, that inadvertent actuation of the containment spray
system was not credible.  The staff evaluates this conclusion in Section 6.2.1.1 of this report. 
Generic Issues
20-33
On the basis of the staff’s evaluations presented in Sections 6.2.1.1, 15.3, and 19.2.3.3.9 of this
report, Issue C-10 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue C-17:  Interim Acceptance Criteria for Solidification Agents for Radioactive Solid Wastes
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue C-17 was intended to develop criteria for the acceptability
of radwaste solidification agents as part of a process control program to package diverse
radioactive plant wastes for shallow land burial.  No current criteria exist for finding solidification
agents acceptable.
As stated in NUREG-0933, the Commission issued 10 CFR Part 61, “Licensing Requirements
for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste,” which defines the licensing requirements for land
disposal of radioactive waste, including Section 61.56, which addresses acceptable waste
characteristics.  Also, the staff developed BTP Effluent Treatment System Branch (ETSB) 11-3
to be part of SRP Section 11.4, “Solid Waste Management Systems,” and to provide design
guidance for solid waste management systems (SWMSs) to be used at LWRs.  Therefore, this
issue has been resolved for implementation at nuclear power plants.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.2, the applicant stated that the solid radwaste system for the
AP1000 design transfers, stores, and prepares spent ion exchange resins for disposal.  The
system also provides for the disposal of filter elements, and the sorting, shredding, and
compaction of compressible dry active wastes.  The solid radwaste system does not provide for
liquid waste concentration or solidification.  This will be provided using mobile systems. 
Solidification of waste is not performed by permanently installed systems.
The staff evaluated the conformance of the AP1000 design to Section 11.4 of the SRP in
Section 11.4 of this report.  Based on the staff’s conclusions in that section, Issue C-17 is
resolved for the AP1000 design.
20.3  New Generic Issues
This section compares the new generic issues of NUREG-0933 listed in Table 20.1-1 of this
report to the AP1000 design.  The majority of the items were chosen either because (1) 10 CFR
52.47(a)(1)(iv) or 10 CFR 52.34(f) requires the design to comply with them, or (2) the applicant
decided that the item applied to the design and included a discussion of the item in DCD Tier 2.
Issue 14:  PWR Pipe Cracks
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 14 addresses cracking in PWR nonprimary (i.e.,
secondary) piping systems as a result of stress corrosion, vibratory and thermal fatigue, and
dynamic loading.  Cracking in PWR nonprimary system piping could lead to a decrease of the
system’s functional capability and could possibly result in such situations as degraded core
cooling.  This issue deals with occurrences of main feedwater (MFW) line cracking in certain
Westinghouse and CE PWRs.  In September 1980, the PWR Pipe Study Group completed its
investigation of the issue and published its findings in NUREG-0691, “Investigation and
Evaluation of Cracking Incidents in Piping of Pressurized Water Reactors.”  This report provides
conclusions regarding system safety and recommends technical solutions to the issue. 
Generic Issues
20-34
The staff developed recommendations that included augmented inspections requirements, but
concluded that they had low risk-reduction value.  Therefore, this issue was resolved and no
new requirements were established.  Other recommendations by the staff included upgrading
the ultrasonic testing (UT) procedures and requirements contained in ASME Section V and
Section XI  to achieve more reliable flaw detection and characterization.  Upgrades to ASME
Section V and Section XI have occurred progressively since 1980, and include the development
of the Appendix VIII supplements to ASME Code, Section XI, incorporated by reference in
10 CFR 50.55a, “Codes and Standards.”  These requirements have resulted in more reliable
flaw detection and characterization through performance demonstration requirements on
equipment, personnel, and procedures.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the design and inspection
requirements for feedwater lines are included in DCD Tier 2, Section 10.4.7.  Further, DCD
Tier 2, Section 6.6, “Inservice Inspection of Class 2 and 3 Components,” addresses the issue of
ISI for ASME Class 2 and 3 components.  Section 6.6 of this report also evaluates this issue. 
Both DCD Tier 2, Section 6.6 and Section 6.6 of this report, discuss weld accessibility for
inspection purposes and compliance with ASME Code inspection requirements.  On this basis,
Issue 14 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 15:  Radiation Effects on Reactor Vessel Supports
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 15 addresses the potential for radiation embrittlement of
the reactor vessel support structures.  Neutron irradiation of structural materials causes
embrittlement that may increase the potential for propagation of flaws that might exist in the
materials.  The potential for brittle fracture of these materials is typically measured in terms of
the nil-ductility transition temperature (NDTT) of the materials.  As long as the operating
environment in which the materials are used has a higher temperature than the NDTT of the
materials, failure by brittle fracture is not expected.  Many materials, when subjected to neutron
irradiation, experience an upward shift in the NDTT, that is, they become more susceptible to
brittle fracture at the operating temperatures of interest.  The design and fabrication of reactor
vessel support structures must account for this effect.
As discussed in NUREG-0933, this issue had a high-priority ranking, but after extensive
evaluation, the staff concluded that no new requirements needed to be issued by the NRC.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the supports for the AP1000 reactor
vessel are designed for loading conditions and environmental factors, including neutron fluence. 
The material requirements include fracture toughness and impact testing requirements in
compliance with ASME Code, Section III, Subsection NF.  These supports are not in the region
of high neutron fluence, where neutron radiation embrittlement of the supports would be a
significant concern.
On the basis of the information presented above, the staff considers the reactor vessel supports
for the AP1000 design to be adequately designed to withstand the effects of radiation, and
Issue 15 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-35
Issue 22:  Inadvertent Boron Dilution Events
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 22 addresses the possibility of core criticality resulting
from inadvertent boron dilution events during cold-shutdown conditions.  Although this
issue was resolved with no new requirements, the acceptance criterion is that plants shall
minimize the consequences of such events by meeting SRP Section 15.4.6, “Chemical and
Volume Control System Malfunction that Results in a Decrease in Boron Concentration in the
Reactor Coolant (PWR).”  Specifically, the plant shall meet the criteria regarding fuel damage
and system pressure, and terminate the dilution transient before the shutdown margin is
eliminated.  If operator action is required to terminate the transient, redundant alarms must be
in place and the following minimum time intervals must be available between the alarm
announcing an unplanned dilution and the loss of shutdown margin: 

30 minutes during refueling (Mode 6)

15 minutes during all other operating modes
In DCD Tier 2, Section 15.4.6, the applicant provided a safety analysis for the AP1000 design
that demonstrates that redundant alarms are available to enable operators to detect and
terminate an inadvertent boron dilution event within the above required time intervals.
The staff identified the following two additional boron dilution scenarios in which a deborated
water slug may accumulate in the RCS, and a restart of the RCPs may cause this slug to pass
through the core, resulting in criticality or a power excursion:
(1)
The first scenario occurs during a plant startup when the reactor is deborated as part of
startup procedures.  A LOOP will result in tripping the RCPs and charging pump.  The
subsequent startup of the diesel generator will restart the charging pump and cause the
accumulation of deborated water in the reactor lower plenum.  With recovery of the
offsite power, the RCP restart will cause this deborated water to pass through the core.
(2)
The second scenario relates to transients or accidents, such as an SBLOCA reflux
condensation, during the post RCP-trip natural circulation phase, that may result in an
accumulation of deborated water in the RCS loop.  An inadvertent restart of the RCPs
will cause this water to pass through the core.
Sections 15.2.4.6 and 15.2.8 of this report documents the staff’s review of inadvertent boron
dilution issues.  The staff considers Issue 22 resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 23:  Reactor Coolant Pump Seal Failures
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 23 addresses the concerns about RCP seal failures that
could cause an SBLOCA.  The PRA analyses have indicated that the overall probability of core
damage as a result of an SBLOCA could be dominated by RCP seal failures.  This
issue includes improving the reliability of RCP seals by reducing the probability of seal failure
during normal operations and under abnormal conditions.  Specifically, acceptable resolutions
to this issue include designing the RCP seal to ensure its integrity following an SBO for an
extended period.
Generic Issues
20-36
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 RCPs are canned-motor
pumps that contain the motor and all rotating components inside a pressure vessel designed for
full RCS pressure.  The applicant stated that the shaft for the pump impeller and rotor is within
this vessel; therefore, seals are not required.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.1, further discusses the
canned motor pump design.  The applicant concluded that because the RCPs do not rely on
seals as being part of the RCPB, Issue 23 is not applicable to the AP1000 design.
The staff agrees that the AP1000 design uses canned-motor RCPs, which contain the motor
and all rotating components inside a pressure vessel designed for full RCS pressure.  The shaft
for the impeller and rotor is contained within the pressure boundary; therefore, the staff
concludes that seals are not required to restrict leakage out of the pump into containment, and
Issue 23 does not apply to the AP1000 design. 
Issue 24:  Automatic ECCS Switchover To Recirculation
Issue 24 addresses the staff’s concerns following a review of operating events that indicated a
significant number of ECCS spurious actuations, particularly the four events that occurred at
the Davis-Besse plant during 1980.  Switchover from injection to recirculation involves
realignment of several valves, and may be achieved by (1) manual realignment, (2) automatic
realignment, or (3) a combination of both.  Each option is vulnerable in varying degrees to
human errors, hardware failures, and common cause failures.  The safety significance of the
issue is that switching suction to the sump prematurely could adversely affect the accident
because the containment sump may not have enough inventory to provide pump suction.  In
NUREG-0933, this issue was classified as a medium-safety priority, but had not been
generically resolved.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 does not switch from
injection to recirculation in the sense that injection is not isolated when recirculation is opened. 
The AP1000 provides for automatic opening of the recirculation line upon a low level signal
from the IRWST.  The staff notes that the AP1000 passive safety system design does not have
safety-related pumps, as do the plants originally addressed by Issue 24.  Furthermore, if the
recirculation line were opened in the AP1000, the flow path from the IRWST to the reactor
vessel would still exist.  This differs from conventional PWRs in which the flow path from the
refueling water storage tank would be closed when the recirculation mode is entered. 
Therefore, the AP1000 design is not analogous to the design of operating PWRs in terms of
Issue 24.  Thus, Issue 24 is not applicable to the AP1000 design.
Issue 29:  Bolting Degradation or Failure in Nuclear Power Plants
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 29 addresses the staff’s concerns about the number of
events involving the degradation of threaded fasteners (e.g., bolt cracking, corrosion, and
failure) in operating plants from 1964 to the early 1980s.  Many of the events were related to
the components of the RCPB and the support structures of major components.  This raised
questions about the integrity of the RCPB and the reliability of the component-support
structures following a LOCA or a seismic event.  The licensees reported failures involving a
variety of threaded fasteners.  The most frequently reported degradation mechanisms were
wastage (corrosion) from boric acid attack and stress-corrosion cracking (SCC).  The former
occurred more often at RCPB joints; the latter in structural bolting.
Generic Issues
20-37
This issue was resolved and no new requirements were established on the basis of
(1) operating experience with bolting in both nuclear and conventional power plants, (2) actions
already taken through bulletins, generic letters, and information notices since 1982, and
(3) industry-proposed recommendations and actions, which are documented in the EPRI
reports NP-5769 “Degradation and Failure of Bolting in Nuclear Power Plants,” issued
April 1988, and NP-5067 “Good Bolting Practices, A Reference Manual for Nuclear Power Plant
Maintenance Personnel,” Volume 1, “Large Bolt Manual,” issued in 1987, and Volume 2, “Small
Bolts and Threaded Fasteners,” issued in 1990.  The resolution of this issue is documented in
GL 91-17, “Generic Safety Issue 29, Bolting Degradation or Failure in Nuclear Power Plants,”
dated October 17, 1991, and NUREG-1339, “Resolution of Generic Safety Issue 29:  Bolting
Degradation or Failure in Nuclear Power Plants,” dated June 30, 1990.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the elements of resolving this issue
pertain to operational and maintenance practices, which will be addressed by the COL
applicant.  It also stated that conformance to the ASME Code, Section III, requirements for
pressure boundary components and related supports, which the AP1000 design meets, will
provide safe operation in the event of bolting degradation.  Further, because of the emphasis in
the AP1000 design on access for maintenance and inspection, the recommended maintenance
practices can be readily implemented.
The staff concludes that the applicant has adequately addressed this issue.  Therefore,
Issue 29 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 43:  Reliability of Air Systems
Resolution of Issue 43, as discussed in NUREG-0933, is not required for the AP1000 design to
meet the requirements of 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv); however, the staff believes it should be
addressed for the AP1000 design because the issue deals with all causes of air system
unavailability.  The issue addresses the incident at Rancho Seco in which desiccant particles in
the valve operator caused the slow closure of a containment isolation valve (CIV).  Desiccant
contamination in the instrument air system (IAS) was also found to be a contributing cause of
the loss of the salt water cooling system at San Onofre in March 1980; this incident resulted in
Issue 44, “Failure of the Saltwater Cooling System.”  Because the only new generic concern
found in the evaluation of the San Onofre event was the common-cause failure of safety-related
components as a result of contamination of the IAS, Issue 44 was combined with Issue 43.
Issue 43 was broadened to include all causes of air system unavailability because LWRs in the
United States rely on air systems to actuate or control safety-related equipment during normal
operation, even though they are not safety-grade systems at most operating plants.  Safety
system design criteria require (and plant accident analyses assume) that safety-related
equipment dependent on air systems will either “fail safe” upon loss of air, or perform its
intended function with the assistance of backup accumulators.  An NRC Office for Analysis and
Evaluation of Operational Data (AEOD) case study highlighted 29 failures of safety-related
systems resulting from degraded or malfunctioning air systems.  These failures contradict the
requirement that safety-related equipment dependent on air systems will either “fail safe” upon
loss of air or perform its intended function with the assistance of backup accumulators.  Some
of the systems that may be significantly degraded or failed are decay heat removal, auxiliary
feedwater, boiling-water reactor scram, main steam isolation, salt water cooling, emergency
diesel generator, containment isolation, and the fuel pool seal system.  The end result of
Generic Issues
20-38
degradation or failure of safety or safety-related systems is an increase in the expected
frequency of core-melt events and, therefore, an increase in public risk.
This issue was resolved by the issuance of GL 88-14, “Instrument Air Supply Problems
Affecting Safety-Related Equipment,” dated August 8, 1988, which required licensees and
applicants to review the recommendations in the two volumes of NUREG-1275, “Operating
Experience Feedback Report—Air Systems Problems,” dated July and December 1987,
respectively, and perform a design and operations verification of the IAS.  The following is a
discussion of the purposes for which the applicant considered the recommendations in
NUREG-1275, Volume 2, for the AP1000 design:

Ensure that air system quality is consistent with equipment specifications and is
periodically monitored and tested.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.1, the applicant stated that in accordance with NUREG-1275,
instrument air quality meets the manufacturer’s standards for the pneumatic equipment
supplied as part of the plant.  In addition, periodic checks are made to assure
high-quality instrument air, as specified in ANSI/Instrument Society of America
(ISA)-S7.3-1981, “Quality Standard for Instrument Air.”

Ensure adequate operator response by formulating and implementing anticipated
transient and system recovery procedures for loss-of-air events.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.7, the applicant stated that the COL applicant will address
DCD Tier 2, 1.9.4.2.3, Issue 43 as part of its training and procedures identified in DCD
Tier 2, Section 13.5.  This is COL Action Item 9.3.1-1.

Improve training to ensure that plant operations and maintenance personnel are
sensitized to the importance of air systems to common mode failures.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.7, the applicant stated that the COL applicant will address
DCD Tier 2, 1.9.4.2.3, Issue 43, as part of its training and procedures identified in DCD
Tier 2, Section 13.5.  This is COL Action Item 9.3.1-1.

Confirm the adequacy and reliability of safety-related backup accumulators.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.1, the applicant stated that no safety-related air-operated
valves (AOVs) rely on safety-related air accumulators to actuate to the fail safe position
upon loss of air pressure.

Verify equipment response to gradual losses of air to ensure that such losses do not
result in events that fall outside the final safety analysis report analysis.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.1.4, the applicant stated that during initial plant testing before
reactor startup, the safety systems utilizing instrument air will be tested, as part of the
safety system test, to verify fail-safe operation of the AOVs upon sudden loss of
instrument air or gradual reduction of air pressure, as described in RG 1.68.3,
“Preoperational Testing of Instrument and Control Air Systems.”
Generic Issues
20-39
The items above are adequately addressed for the AP1000 design.  Therefore, the staff finds
Issue 43 to be resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 45:  Inoperability of Instruments Due to Extreme Cold Weather
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 45 addresses the potential for safety-related equipment
instrument lines to become inoperable as a result of freezing or reaching the precipitation point
of the sensing fluids.  Typical safety-related systems employ pressure and level sensors that
use small-bore instrumentation lines.  Most operating plants contain safety-related equipment
and systems, parts of which are exposed to ambient temperature conditions.  These lines
generally contain liquid (e.g., borated water) that is susceptible to freezing.  Where systems or
components and their associated instrumentation are exposed to subfreezing temperatures,
heat tracing or insulation, or both, is used to minimize the effects of cold temperatures.  If these
sensing lines should freeze, they may prevent a safety-related system or component from
performing its safety function.
To resolve this issue, the staff issued RG 1.151, “Instrument Sensing Lines,” to supplement the
existing guidance and requirements in the SRP, applicable GDC, and ISA-67.02, “Nuclear
Safety-Related Instrument Sensing Line Piping and Tubing Standards for Use in Nuclear Power
Plants.”  RG 1.151 addresses the prevention of freezing in safety-related instrument-sensing
lines and includes such design issues as diversity, independence, monitoring, and alarms.  In
February 1984, SRP Sections 7.1, “Instrumentation and Controls—Introduction,” Revision 3; to
Section 7.1, Appendix A, Revision 1; and 7.7, “Control Systems,” Revision 3, were revised to
incorporate the resolution of this issue.  Thus, this issue was resolved and new requirements
were issued.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design complies with
SRP Sections 7.1; Section 7.1, Appendix A; Section 7.5, “Information Systems Important to
Safety”; and Section 7.7.  DCD Tier 2, Appendix 1A, addresses the conformance of the AP1000
design to RG 1.151.
On this basis, the staff concludes that the AP1000 design complies with the relevant sections of
RG 1.151 and the updated SRP sections.  Therefore, Issue 45 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue 51: Proposed Requirements for Improving the Reliability of Open-Cycle Service Water
Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 51 addresses fouling of safety-related, open-cycle SWSs
by either mud, silt, corrosion products, or aquatic bivalves.  This problem has led to plant
shutdowns, reduced power operation for repairs and modifications, and degraded modes of
operation in nuclear power plants.  This issue originally addressed only aquatic bivalves. 
However, the issues of flow blockage in essential equipment caused by corbicula (Issue 32)
and SWS flow blockage caused by blue mussels (Issue 52) were incorporated into this issue,
and Issue 51 was expanded to consider whether the NRC staff should develop new
requirements for improving the reliability of open-cycle water systems.  New requirements for
baseline fouling programs for nuclear power plants were issued in GL 89-13, “Service Water
System Problems Affecting Safety-Related Equipment,” dated July 18, 1989.
Generic Issues
20-40
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the SWS for the AP1000 design
provides cooling water to the component cooling water (CCW) system and has no
safety-related functions.  None of the safety-related equipment requires water cooling to effect
a safe shutdown or mitigate the effects of design-basis events.  Heat transfer to the UHS is
accomplished by heat transfer through the containment shell to the air and water flowing on the
outside of the shell.
DCD Tier 2, Section 9.2.1, discusses the design of the SWS and the provisions for minimizing
long-term corrosion and organic fouling.
On the basis of the staff’s review, which is discussed in Section 9.2.1 of this report, the staff
concludes that the SWS is adequately designed to minimize fouling, and Issue 51 is resolved
for the AP1000 design.
Issue 57:  Effects of Fire Protection System Actuation on Safety-Related Equipment
Issue 57, as well as NUREG-5580, “Evaluation of Generic Issue 57:  Effects of Fire Protection
System Actuation on Safety Related Equipment,” addresses fire protection system (FPS)
actuations that have caused adverse interactions with safety-related equipment at operating
nuclear power plants.  Experience has shown that safety-related equipment subjected to water
spray (e.g., from the FPS) could be rendered inoperable, and that numerous spurious
actuations of the FPS have been initiated by operator testing errors or by maintenance
activities, steam, or high humidity in the vicinity of FPS detectors. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 9A.3.1.1, “Containment/Shield Building,” specifies that inadvertent
operation of an automatic suppression system is prevented by the normally closed CIV in the
water supply line.  Operator action is required to open this valve and admit water to the system. 
Therefore, because the AP1000 design does not provide automatic fire suppression in
safety-related areas, Issue 57 for the AP1000 design is considered resolved.
Issue 67.3.3:  Improved Accident Monitoring
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 67.3.3 addresses weaknesses in reactor system
monitoring that could inhibit correct operator responses to events similar to the SG tube rupture
(SGTR) event at the Ginna Power Plant on January 25, 1982.  During the event, weaknesses in
accident monitoring were apparent including (1) nonredundant monitoring of RCS pressure,
(2) failure of the position indication for the SG relief and safety valves, and (3) limited range of
the charging pump flow indicator.  As stated in NUREG-0933 and NUREG-0737, “Clarification
of TMI Action Plan Requirements,” Supplement 1 dated January 1983, the implementation of
the recommendations described in RG 1.97, “Instrumentation for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear
Power Plants To Assess Plant and Environs Conditions During and Following an Accident,”
Revision 2, December 1980, resolved this issue.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, “Issue 67.3.3: AP1000 Response,” the applicant stated that it
followed the guidance of RG 1.97 in determining the appropriate monitoring parameters for the
AP1000 design.  Section 7.5 of this report describes the postaccident monitoring system.
Generic Issues
20-41
The staff concludes, as stated in Section 7.5 of this report, that the postaccident monitoring
system conforms to RG 1.97, Revision 3 and, therefore, is acceptable.  The staff concludes that
Issue 67.3.3 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 70:  Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORV) and Block Valve Reliability
Power-operated relief valves (PORVs) and block valves were originally designed as non-safety
components in the reactor pressure control system for use only when plants are in operation;
the block valves were installed because of expected leakage from the PORVs.  Neither valve
type is needed to safely shut down a plant or to mitigate the consequences of accidents.  In
1983, the staff determined that PORVs were relied on to mitigate design-basis SGTR accidents
and questioned the acceptability of relying on non-safety-grade components to mitigate design-
basis accidents (DBAs).  Issue 70, addresses the assessment of the need for improving the
reliability of PORVs and block valves.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(iv), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not
include PORVs.  Overpressure protection is provided by two totally enclosed, pop-type safety
valves.  If the pressurizer pressure exceeds the set pressure, the safety valves lift.  A
temperature indicator in the discharge piping for each safety valve alarms on high temperature
levels to alert the operator to when the valves open.  The staff concludes that because the
AP1000 design does not include PORVs and block valves, Issue 70 is not applicable.  
Issue 73:  Detached Thermal Sleeves
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 73 addresses the staff’s concerns about reports of fatigue
failures of thermal sleeve assemblies in the piping systems of both PWRs and BWRs between
1978 and 1980.  Five generations (0 through 4) of thermal sleeves have been used in the
applicant’s reactors.  Only “Generation 3” thermal sleeves are susceptible to high-cycle
stresses due to flow-induced vibrations because of the particular weld attachments used in that
design.  The vibrations caused fatigue failures at the attachment welds and subsequent
cracking and tearing away of the thermal sleeves.  This issue was applicable to the design and
operation of approximately 20 of the applicant’s plants that used Generation 3 thermal sleeves. 
This issue was resolved for the applicant’s plants with the publication of NUREG/CR-6010,
“History and Current Status of Generation 3 Thermal Sleeves in Westinghouse Nuclear Power
Plants,” in July 1992.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 does not use
Generation 3 thermal sleeves.  Based on the staff’s review of this information, Issue 73 is
resolved for the AP1000 design.  
Issue 75:  Generic Implications of ATWS Events at Salem Nuclear Plant
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 75 addresses the generic implications of two events at
Salem Unit 1 where there were failures to scram automatically because of the failure of both
reactor trip breakers to open upon receipt of an actuation signal.  This issue was expanded to
include a number of issues raised by the staff that were closely related to the design and testing
of the reactor protection system (RPS).  The requirements for this issue were stated in
GL 83-28, “Required Actions Based on Generic Implications of Salem ATWS Event,” dated
July 8, 1983.
Generic Issues
20-42
The actions covered by GL 83-28 fell into the following four areas:
(1)
Post-trip review—This action addressed the program, procedures, and data collection
capability to ensure that the causes for unscheduled reactor shutdowns, as well as the
response of safety-related equipment, are fully understood prior to plant restart.
(2)
Equipment classification and vendor interface—This action addressed the programs for
ensuring that all components necessary for performing required safety-related functions
are properly identified in documents, procedures, and information-handling systems that
are used to control safety-related plant activities.  In addition, this action addressed the
establishment and maintenance of a program to ensure that vendor information for
safety-related components is complete.
(3)
Post-maintenance testing—This action addressed post-maintenance operability testing
of safety-related components.
(4)
RTS reliability improvements—This action ensures that (a) vendor-recommended
reactor trip breaker modifications and associated RPS changes are completed in PWRs,
(b) a comprehensive program of preventive maintenance and surveillance testing is
implemented for the reactor trip breakers in PWRs, (c) the shunt trip attachment
activates automatically in all PWRs that use circuit breakers in their RTS, and (d) online
functional testing of the RTS is performed on all LWRs.
DCD Tier 2, Section 7.1, outlines the AP1000 design of the reactor trip breakers and the RPS. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 7.2 details information on the functional requirements for reactor trip and
conformance with industry and regulatory guidance.  DCD Tier 2, Sections 7.1.2.6 and 7.1.2.13
outline the provisions provided to display and record parameters used by the RTS.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 7.5, also provides information on the requirements for safety-related display
information.  Based on the staff’s review of this information, Issue 75 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue 79:  Unanalyzed Reactor Vessel Thermal Stress during Natural Convection Cooldown
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 79 addresses the concern for an unanalyzed reactor
vessel thermal stress during natural convection cooldown (NCC) of PWR reactors.  The
concern emerged from a preliminary evaluation of the voiding event that occurred in the upper
head of the St. Lucie Unit 1 reactor on June 11, 1980.  On the basis of several conservative
assumptions, B&W tentatively concluded that during natural convection cooling, axial
temperature gradients could develop in the vessel flange area, which could produce thermal
stresses in the flange area or in the studs, that might exceed values allowed by ASME Code,
Section III, when added to the stresses already considered (e.g., boltup loads or pressure
loads).
The staff’s efforts to resolve this issue were based on a review of a B&W NCC analysis and the
results of an NCC analysis conducted by an NRC contractor.  Both of these analyses were
performed for the B&W 177 fuel assembly reactor vessel.  NUREG-1374, “An Evaluation of
PWR Reactor Vessel Thermal Stress During NCC,” dated May 1991, and GL 92-02,
“Resolution of Generic Issue 79, ‘Unanalyzed Reactor Vessel (PWR) Thermal Stress During
Natural Convection Cooldown’,” dated March 1992, documents the resolution of Issue 79.  On
Generic Issues
20-43
the basis of conservative analyses and qualitative extrapolation of the results, the staff
concluded the following in NUREG-1374:

The B&W 177 was analyzed for NCC events that are bounded by the NCC transient
profile shown in Figure 3 of NUREG-1374.  The bounding profile in this figure was
generated by the staff’s contractor by using a conservative assumption of a maximum
cooldown rate of 37.8 °C (100 °F) per hour during the NCC event.  The contractor used
this profile in its conservative confirmatory stress analysis of the B&W 177.

Adequate geometric similarity exists between the B&W 177 and other U.S. PWRs to
support extending the findings and conclusions in NUREG-1374 to all U.S. PWRs.

It is extremely unlikely that a single NCC event will cause the failure of any existing U.S.
PWR reactor vessel, even if a cooldown rate of 37.8 °F (100 °F) per hour is exceeded.

NCC events of the type analyzed (i.e., NCC events that result in the plant being brought
to a cold-shutdown condition) have a low frequency of occurrence.  The staff is aware of
only one such event, which occurred at St. Lucie as discussed above.
This issue was resolved and no new requirements were established because (1) NCC events
that result in the plant being brought to a cold-shutdown condition occur infrequently, and
(2) the actual severity of a specific NCC event will determine the need for licensee actions (if
any), and the extent of any required following certain NCC events that may place a reactor
vessel in an unanalyzed condition or outside its documented design basis.
DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, references DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.1.1.2.11, and states that the
COL applicant will respond to the issues raised in GL 92-02.  This is COL Action Item 20.7.1-1. 
The applicant has verified that the analyses to account for NCC events applicable to the
AP1000 reactor vessel integrity were evaluated and bounded by the generic assumptions and
conclusions presented in NUREG-1374 and GL 92-02.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.1.1, the
applicant presented the AP1000 design transients that are considered in the design and fatigue
analysis of ASME Class 1 components.  As discussed in Section 3.9.1.1 of this report, all of
these transients have been adjusted for a 60-year plant life.  DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.1.1.2.11,
specifies the total number of NCC transients used in the reactor vessel design for its 60-year
life span.  In addition, DCD Tier 2, Figure 5.3-3, provides a generic curve presenting operating
temperature, pressure, and cooldown rate (not exceeding 37.8 °C/hr (100 °F/hr)) for the reactor
vessel, which is consistent with recommendations stated in GL 92-02 and NUREG-1374.  On
the basis of the above information, the staff concludes that the AP1000 analyses to account for
NCC events are bounded by the analyses discussed in NUREG-1374 and, therefore, are
acceptable.
Thus, the staff concludes that Issue 79 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 82:  Beyond-Design-Basis Accidents in Spent Fuel Pools
WASH-1400, (NUREG-75/014) “Reactor Safety Study, An Assessment of Accident Risks in
U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants,” dated October 1975 examines the risks of beyond-
design-bases accidents in the spent fuel storage pool. The report concludes that these risks
were orders of magnitude below those involving the reactor core.  Issue 82 in NUREG-0933
Generic Issues
20-44
reexamines accidents in the spent fuel storage pool for two reasons.  First, spent fuel is being
stored instead of reprocessed.  This has led to the expansion of onsite fuel storage by means of
high-density storage racks, which results in a larger inventory of fission products in the pool, a
greater heat load on the pool cooling system, and less distance between adjacent fuel
assemblies.  Second, some laboratory studies suggest the possibility of fire propagation
between assemblies in an air-cooled environment.  These two reasons, in combination, provide
the basis for an accident scenario that was not previously considered.
As stated in NUREG-0933, this issue was resolved and no new requirements were established
because of the large inherent safety margins in the design and construction of spent fuel pools. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 includes design
provisions that preclude draining of the spent fuel pool.  In addition, the AP1000 includes
provisions to supply water to the pool in the event the water covering the spent fuel begins to
boil off. 
The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by the applicant, as well as the information
provided in DCD Tier 2, Section 9.1.  As a result of its review, the staff considers Issue 82 to be
resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 83:  Control Room Habitability
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 83 addresses the significant discrepancies found during a
survey of existing plant control rooms before 1983.  These discrepancies included the
inconsistencies between the design, construction, and operation of the control room habitability
systems and the descriptions in the licensing-basis documentation.  In addition, the staff
determined that total system testing was inadequate, and that the control systems were not
always tested in accordance with the plant TS.  Issues related to Issue 83 include
(1) Issue B-36 regarding the criteria for air filtration and adsorption units for atmospheric
cleanup systems, (2) Issue B-66 regarding the control room infiltration measurements, and
(3) Issue III.D.3.4, also concerning control room habitability.  Sections 20.2 and 20.4 of this
report discuss these three issues. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that habitability of the MCR during normal
operation is provided by the non-safety-related nuclear island VBS.  In the event of a DBA
involving a radiation release or a loss of all ac power event, the non-safety-related nuclear
island VBS is automatically terminated, the MCR pressure boundary is isolated, and the safety-
related VES is actuated.
The safety-related VES supplies breathable quality air for the MCR operators while the MCR is
isolated.  In the event of an external smoke or radiation release, the non-safety-related nuclear
island VBS provides for a supplemental filtration mode of operation, as discussed in DCD
Tier 2, Section 9.4.  In the event of a Hi-Hi radiation level, the safety-related VES is actuated. 
In the unlikely event of a toxic chemical release, the safety-related VES has the capability to be
manually actuated by the operators.  In addition, a 6-hour supply of self-contained portable
breathing equipment is stored inside the MCR pressure boundary.
In a letter dated May 21, 2003, the applicant committed to conform to the guidance of RG 1.78,
Revision 1, to meet the requirements of TMI Action Plan Item III.D.3.4 and GDC 19.  In
Generic Issues
20-45
addition, the applicant agreed to revise the DCD to refer to RG 1.78, Revision 1.  Confirmatory
Item 6.4-1 in the DSER identified the need for inclusion of this information in the DCD.  The
staff has reviewed the DCD and concludes that it appropriately refers to RG 1.78, Revision 1. 
Therefore, Confirmatory Item 6.4-1 is resolved.
DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.7, states that the COL applicant referencing the AP1000 certified
design is responsible for the amount and location of possible sources of toxic chemicals in or
near the plant and for seismic Category I, Class 1E toxic gas monitoring, as required.  It also
states that RG 1.78, Revision 1, addresses control room protection for toxic chemicals and
evaluation of offsite toxic releases (including the potential for toxic releases beyond 72 hours) in
order to meet the requirements of TMI Action Plan Item III.D.3.4 and GDC 19.  This is COL
Action Item 6.4-1.
DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.7, states that the COL applicant is responsible for verifying that
procedures and training for control room habitability are consistent with the intent of GSI 83. 
This is COL Action Item 6.4-2.
The applicant submitted the results of radiological consequence analyses for personnel in the
MCR during a DBA in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.4.  DCD Tier 2, Section 15.6.5.3, detailed the
analysis assumptions for modeling the doses to MCR personnel.  Open Item 6.4-1 in the DSER,
identified that the staff could not complete its review and independent dose assessment until it
had resolved questions on the assumed aerosol removal rates in the containment.
In Section 6.4 of this report, the staff resolved Open Item 6.4-1 and found that the VES, under
“high-high” radiation conditions as described in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4, is capable of mitigating
the dose in MCR following DBAs to meet the dose criteria specified in GDC 19 as applied to the
AP1000 design.
Therefore, Issue 83 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 87:  Failure of High-Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) Steamline without Isolation
Issue 87 addresses the staff’s concerns about a postulated break in the high-pressure coolant
injection (HPCI) steam supply line and the uncertainty regarding the operability of the isolation
valves for the HPCI steam supply line under these conditions.  A break in the line could lead to
high flow and high differential pressure that may inhibit closure of the isolation valve.  These
valves typically cannot be tested in situ for the high design flow rates and pressures. 
Therefore, subsequent to installation of these valves, it is not feasible to demonstrate the
capability of the valves to close when exposed to the forces created by the flow resulting from a
postulated break downstream.  This issue was resolved by the issuance of GL 89-10, “Safety-
Related Motor-Operated Valve Testing and Surveillance,” and its supplements on safety-related
motor-operated valve (MOV) testing, GL 96-05, “Periodic Verification of Design-Basis Capability
of Safety-Related Power Operated Valves,” and SECY-93-087, “Policy, Technical, and
Licensing Issues Pertaining to Evolutionary and Advanced Light-Water Reactors (ALWR)
Designs,” which recommended these valves be periodically tested inservice, under full flow and
actual plant conditions, where practical.  Furthermore, SECY-94-084, “Policy and Technical
Issues Associated with the Regulatory Treatment of Non-Safety Systems in Passive Plant
Designs,” and SECY-95-135, “Changes to Performance Indicator Programs,” provide additional
guidelines for testing MOVs. 
Generic Issues
20-46
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that safety-related MOVs in the AP1000
are subject to qualification testing to demonstrate the capability of the valve to open, close, and
seat against the maximum differential pressure and flow.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.8, outlines
the requirements for MOV qualification testing.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.8.4, the applicant
further stated that the COL applicant will submit the inservice testing (IST) program for
safety-related valves.  This IST program will be developed using the requirements outlined in
DCD Tier 2, Sections 3.9.6 and 5.4.8.  The staff concludes that the information related to
Issue 87 in the above DCD Tier 2 sections is acceptable.  Section 3.9.6 of this report provides
the staff’s evaluation of MOV-related issues.  On the basis of the staff’s review of this
information, Issue 87 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 89:  Stiff Pipe Clamps
Issue 89 addresses the staff’s concerns about the use of structurally stiff clamps to support
safety-related piping systems.  Stiff pipe clamp designs differ from conventional pipe support
clamps by including features such as uncommonly large dimensions for clamp width and/or
thickness, use of high-strength or non-ASME approved materials, and large preloading of
clamp bolts.  The staff found that piping designers commonly assumed that the pipe clamp-
induced localized stresses on piping systems were negligible, and did not warrant any specific
consideration.  This assumption was acceptable for most conventional pipe clamp applications. 
However, for some applications, certain piping system conditions, coupled with the design and
installation requirements for stiff pipe clamps could result in interaction effects that should be
evaluated to determine the significance of any localized stresses induced in the piping.  The
value/impact assessment included in NUREG-0933 assigns this issue a low-priority ranking for
the group of operating plants considered.  However, for future plants, only the value/impact
assessment results in a medium-priority ranking.  
The staff’s review of DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, noted that the applicant did not specifically
address this issue for the AP1000 design.  The staff requested additional information on
whether the effects of using stiff pipe clamps are considered in the AP1000 piping design.  In
response to RAI 210.066, the applicant stated that the pipe support design criteria for the
AP1000 prohibit the use of “stiff” yoke-type pipe clamps because they induce large local
stresses into the supported piping system.  The staff reviewed the Westinghouse pipe support
design criteria document.  Based on its evaluation of this information, the staff concludes that
Issue 89 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 93:  Steam Binding of Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 93 addresses the potential for a common-mode failure of
the AFWS or the emergency feedwater system (EFWS) resulting from steam binding of the
AFWS pumps caused by heated MFW leaking back through check valves.  The AFWS is used
to supply water to the SGs should the MFW system be lost and steam binding of the AFW
pumps result in the loss of the AFWS.
The AFWS may be isolated from the MFW system by a check valve or one or more isolation
valves (depending upon the specific design) to keep hot MFW from entering the AFWS. 
However, operating experience has shown that check valves tend to leak, thus permitting hot
MFW to enter the AFWS.  This hot feedwater can subsequently flash to steam in the AFW
pumps and discharge lines, causing steam binding of the pumps.
Generic Issues
20-47
In addition, the AFW piping is sometimes arranged so that each AFW pump is connected
through a single check valve (which is used to prevent back leakage) to piping that is common
to two or three pumps.  This arrangement creates the potential for common-mode failures as
the hot feedwater leaks back through the check valves into other AFW pumps.
The staff issued GL 88-03,“Resolution of Generic Safety Issue 93, ‘Steam Binding of Auxiliary
Feedwater Pumps,’” dated February 17, 1988, to the industry to resolve this issue.  This generic
letter implements monitoring and corrective procedures to minimize the likelihood of steam
binding of the AFWS pumps.  One of the corrective actions to be taken is the monitoring of
AFW pump discharge piping temperatures to ensure that the fluid temperatures remain at or
near ambient temperature.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not have a
safety-related AFWS.  The PXS provides the safety-related function of cooling the RCS in the
event of loss of feedwater.  The startup feedwater system (SUFWS) provides the SGs with
feedwater during startup, hot standby, cooldown, and when the main feedwater pumps are not
available and have no safety-related function other than containment isolation.  
The SUFWS includes temperature instrumentation in the pump discharge for monitoring of the
temperature of the SUFWS.  The system also includes a normally closed isolation valve and a
normally closed check valve for each pump, limiting potential back leakage. 
The staff concludes that steam binding is not a problem for the AP1000 design because the
PXS does not include any pumps that could fail as a result of steam binding, and the SUFWS is
not safety-related.  Therefore, Issue 93 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 94:  Additional Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection for Light-Water Reactors
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 94 addresses low-temperature overpressurization events,
along with the resolution of Issue A-26, which is discussed in Section 20.2 of this report.  This
issue was intended to address the additional guidance for RCS LTOP to ensure reactor vessel
integrity beyond the requirements specified for Issue A-26 in SRP Section 5.2.2, “Overpressure
Protection,” and BTP RSB 5-2.  Issue 94 was resolved by requiring the TS for overpressure
protection to be consistent with those specified in Enclosure B to GL 90-06, “Resolution of
Generic Issue 70, Power-Operated Relief Valve and Block Valve Reliability, and Generic
Issue 94, Additional Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection for Light-Water Reactors,
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54(f),” dated June 25, 1990.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated (1) that the reactor vessel for the AP1000
was designed to be less susceptible to brittle fracture during an LTOP event, (2) that the
material requirements and welding processes were developed to enhance resistance to
embrittlement, and (3) that the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel is discussed in DCD
Tier 2, Section 5.3.2.
As discussed in DCD Tier 2, Sections 1.9.4.2.3 and 5.4.7, one of the safety-related functions of
the normal RNS is to provide LTOP for the RCS during refueling, startup, and shutdown
operations.  The AP1000 RNS design contains a relief valve to provide this safety-related LTOP
function.  It is designed to limit the RCS pressure to within the limits specified in 10 CFR
Part 50, Appendix G.  In accordance with DCD Tier 2, Table 3.2-3 and Figure 5.4-7, this relief

valve and its associated piping are classified as safety-related ASME Class 2, seismic
Category I components.  DCD Tier 2, Tables 3.2-1 and 3.9-16 identify these components as
being subject to ISI and testing in accordance with the requirements of ASME Code, Section XI. 
On the basis of the above information, the staff concludes that the AP1000 reactor vessel has
been adequately designed for LTOP.
GL 90-06 addresses the establishment of additional guidance for RCS LTOP to ensure reactor
vessel and RCS integrity beyond that identified in the resolution for Issue A-26.  As a resolution
for Issue 94, GL 90-06 requires a revision to the plant’s TS concerning the capability of the
LTOP system.  Other possible solutions identified in GL 90-06 include hardware modifications,
such as the use of the RHR system relief valves, and requiring the LTOP system to be fully
safety-related.
GL 90-06 states that the LTOP availability should be ensured by limiting the allowable outage
time to 24 hours for a single LTOP channel while operating in Modes 5 and 6.  The AP1000 TS
limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.4.14, “Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection
(LTOP) System,” found in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 16, for the LTOP system requires that, with the
accumulators isolated, either the RNS suction relief valve or the RCS depressurized with an
open RCS vent of greater than or equal to 60 centimeters squared (cm2) (9.3 inches squared
(in.2)) be operable.  If the RNS suction relief valve is inoperable, Action Item C of LCO 3.4.14
requires either that the relief valve be restored to operable status, or that the RCS be
depressurized and the RCS vent be established within 8 hours.  The applicant stated in
BASES B3.4.14 that with the RCS depressurized, a vent size of 60 cm2 (9.3 in.2) is capable of
mitigating a limiting overpressure transient.  The area of the vent is equivalent to the area of the
inlet pipe to the RNS suction relief valve so the capacity of the vent is greater than the flow
possible with either the mass or heat input transient, while maintaining the RCS pressure less
than the maximum pressure on the P/T limit curve.  The staff concludes that the AP1000 TS is
consistent with GL 90-06 and, therefore, is acceptable. 
Issue 94 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 103:  Design for Probable Maximum Precipitation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 103 addresses the acceptable methodology for
determining the design flood level for a particular plant site.  The use of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) procedures for determining the probable maximum
precipitation for a site was questioned after a licensee disputed the use of two of NOAA
hydrometeorological reports.  The issue was resolved with the revisions to SRP Sections 2.4.2
and 2.4.3 in 1989, incorporating the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) procedures and
criteria contained in the latest National Weather Service publications.  This was documented in
Volume 54, page 31268, of the Federal Register (54 FR 31268), issued on July 27, 1989, and
GL 89-22, “Potential for Increased Roof and Plant Area Flood Runoff Depth at Licensed
Nuclear Power Plants Due to Recent Change in Probable Maximum Precipitation Criteria
Developed by the National Weather Service,” dated October 19, 1989.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the PMP is a site-related parameter;
the AP1000 is designed for a PMP of 49.3 cm (19.4 inches) per hour and 15.2 cm (6 inches) in
a 5-minute interval, as specified in DCD Tier 2, Table 2-1.  The applicant stated that the COL

applicant is responsible for demonstrating that the specific site parameters are within the limits
specified for the standard AP1000 design.  The specific site is acceptable if the site
characteristics are within the AP1000 plant site design parameters detailed in DCD Tier 2,
Table 2-1.  For cases in which a specific site characteristic is outside the DCD Tier 2, Table 2-1
parameters, the applicant stated that the COL applicant must demonstrate that the site
characteristic does not exceed the capability of the AP1000 design.  DCD Tier 2, Chapter 2,
provides additional information on the site interface parameters.
The COL applicant must use site-specific environmental data to determine the PMP in
accordance with SRP Sections 2.4.2, “Floods,” and 2.4.3, “Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) on
Streams and Rivers.”  This is to ensure that the maximum flood level for the AP1000 design
specified in DCD Tier 2, Table 2-1 shall not be exceeded by the site-specific flood level. 
Section 2.4 of this report further discusses this issue.  This is COL Action Item 2.4.1-1.
Based on its review of this information, the staff concludes that Issue 103 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue 105:  Interfacing Systems LOCA at Light-Water Reactors (LWRs) 
Issue 105 was limited to pressure isolation valves (PIVs) in BWRs and was resolved by
requiring leak-testing of the check valves that isolate low-pressure systems that are connected
at the RCS outside of containment.  It is related to Issue 96, which addressed PIVs between the
RCS and RHR systems in PWRs.  As stated in NUREG-0933, the staff issued Information
Notice (IN) 92-36, “Intersystem LOCA Outside Containment,” dated May 7, 1992, on this
subject.  The individual plant examinations required by the staff on operating plants included
analyses of these sequences.  This issue was resolved without any new requirements for
operating plants.
For advanced reactor design, the staff stated its position regarding intersystem LOCA
(ISLOCA) protection in SECY-90-016, “Evolutionary Light Water Reactor (LWR) Certification
Issues and Their Relationship to Current Regulatory Requirements,” as well as in
SECY-93-087.  The staff states that ALWR designs should reduce the possibility of a LOCA
outside containment by designing, to the extent practicable, all systems and subsystems
connected to the RCS to an ultimate rupture strength (URS) at least equal to full RCS pressure. 
The phrase “to the extent practicable” is a recognition that all systems must eventually interface
with the atmosphere, and that it would be difficult or prohibitively expensive to design certain
large tanks and heat exchangers with the URS equal to full RCS pressure.  Piping runs should
be designed to meet the URS criteria, as should all associated flanges, connectors, and
packings, including valve stem seals, pump seals, heat exchanger tubes, valve bonnets, and
RCS drain and vent lines.  The designer should attempt to reduce the level of pressure
challenge to all systems and subsystems connected to the RCS.
In Section 3.9.3.1 of this report, the staff discusses its evaluation that establishes the minimum
pressure for which low-pressure systems should be designed to ensure reasonable protection
against burst failure, should the low-pressure system be subject to full RCS pressure. 
Section 3.9.3.1.5.7, “AP1000 Design Criteria for ISLOCA,” of this report, contains the design
criteria proposed by the applicant for the low-pressure portion of the RNS.  On the basis of this
evaluation, the staff concludes that these criteria are acceptable to assure that the low-pressure
side of any applicable system has been designed to meet the full RCS URS criteria.
Generic Issues
20-50
For all interfacing systems and components that do not meet the full RCS URS criteria, the
applicant must justify why it is not practical to reduce the pressure challenge any further.  The
applicant must also provide compensating isolation capability.  For example, applicants should
demonstrate for each interface that the degree and quality of isolation or reduced severity of the
potential pressure challenges compensate for and justify the safety of the low-pressure
interfacing systems or components.  The adequacy of pressure relief and the piping of relief
back to primary containment are possible considerations.  As identified in SECY-90-016, each
of these interfacing systems that has not been designed to withstand full RCS pressure must
also include the following three protection measures:  
(1)
the capability for leak testing of the pressure isolation valves
(2)
valve position indication that is available in the control room when isolation valve
operators are deenergized
(3)
high-pressure alarms to warn control room operators when rising RCS pressure
approaches the design pressure of the attached low-pressure system and both isolation
valves are not closed
DCD Section 1.9.5.1.7, “Intersystem LOCA,” provides the applicant’s response regarding
compliance of the AP1000 design with the staff’s position on ISLOCA.  The applicant stated
that the AP1000 design has incorporated various design features to address ISLOCA
challenges.  These design features result in very low AP1000 CDF for ISLOCAs as compared
to currently operating nuclear power plants.  The design features are primarily associated with
the RNS and are discussed in Section 3 of WCAP-15993, Revision 1, “Evaluation of the
AP1000 Conformance to Inter-System Loss-of-Coolant Accident Acceptance Criteria,” dated
March 2003, and DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.7.  WCAP-15993 provides a systematic evaluation of
the AP1000 design responses of various systems interfacing the RCS to the ISLOCA
challenges. 
The systematic evaluation process includes (1) a review of the AP1000 piping and
instrumentation drawings (P&ID) to identify those primary interfacing systems or subsystems
directly interfacing with the RCS, and the secondary interfacing systems or subsystems
interfacing with the primary interfacing systems, and (2) identification of primary and secondary
systems and subsystems having a URS less than the RCS pressure.  For those systems or
subsystems not meeting the criterion of the URS greater than or equal to the RCS pressure, a
design evaluation is made considering whether the system or subsystem is inside containment,
whether it meets the three criteria specified in SECY-90-016, and whether it includes other
specific design features that would prevent an ISLOCA to the extent practical.  The report also
provides the reasons why it is not practical to design large, low-design pressure tanks and tank
structures that are vented to the atmosphere to the high-pressure criterion.  Interfacing systems
or subsystems that connect directly to an atmospheric tank are excluded from further ISLOCA
consideration.  This is limited to the piping connected directly to the atmospheric tank, up to the
first isolation valve, other than a locked-open, manual isolation valve. 
The staff’s evaluation of various interfacing systems and subsystems follows.
Generic Issues
20-51
Normal Residual Heat Removal System
The portions of the RNS from the RCS to the CIVs outside containment are designed to the
RCS operating pressure.  The portions downstream of the CIV and upstream of the discharge
line CIV are designed so that the URS is not less than the RCS operating pressure.  Therefore,
these portions are not of ISLOCA concern.  The only portion of the RNS having a URS lower
than the RCS pressure is the mechanical shaft seal of the RNS pump, which has a design
pressure of 6200 kPa (900 psig).  Section 3.1.3.2 of WCAP-15993 discusses the difficulties of
designing the RNS pump seal to withstand full RCS pressure.  A fundamental problem is that
any type of seal that can withstand RCS pressure will likely have abnormally fast wear of the
seal faces during normal plant operation at low seal pressures.  This increased wear at normal
plant operating conditions could well prevent the seal from maintaining the pressure boundary if
ever exposed to the full RCS pressure.  Use of high-pressure seals will also require more
frequent maintenance during normal operation.  Therefore, it is impractical to design a seal that
would maintain the RCS pressure boundary with no leakage and also operate satisfactorily at
low-pressure conditions.  The AP1000 RNS pump mechanical seal is designed to minimize the
amount of leakage if exposed to full RCS pressure.  An Idaho National Engineering Laboratory
(INEL) study on the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station DHR pump seal, with a design
pressure of 3,100 kPa (450 psig), found that the rotating seal would maintain its structural
integrity at pressures in excess of 17,200 kPa (2,500 psi), and the mechanical seals can
withstand a pressure of 8,300–8,600 kPa (1,200–1,250 psi) without leaking.  The AP1000 RNS
pump mechanical seal is similar to the Davis-Besse DHR pumps, but its design pressure is
twice as high.  The AP1000 RNS pump is fitted with a disaster bushing that limits the leakage
from the pump to within the capabilities of the normal makeup system in case of catastrophic
mechanical seal failure.  Leakage can be controlled with the seal leakoff line routed to a floor
drain that is routed to the auxiliary building sump.  This is more favorable than a seal specially
designed for full RCS pressure at the expense of normal-condition reliability. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.7.2.2, the applicant discussed the AP1000 design features in the
RNS specifically aimed at reducing the likelihood of an ISLOCA.  On the suction side, there is a
normally closed, motor-operated isolation valve in the common suction line outside
containment, and two normally closed, motor-operated isolation valves in each parallel suction
line inside the containment.  There is a relief valve with a set pressure of 4385 kPa (636 psig)
connected to the RNS pump suction line inside containment, which is designed to provide
LTOP of the RCS to reduce the risk of overpressurizing the RNS.  On the discharge side, the
common discharge line has a safety-related containment isolation check valve inside
containment and a safety-related motor-operated isolation valve outside containment.  MOVs
inside the containment are interlocked to prevent them from opening when the RCS pressure is
above the RNS operating pressure of 3100 kPa (450 psig).  The power to these isolation valves
is administratively blocked at the valve motor control centers to prevent inadvertent opening.  In
addition, the discharge header contains a relief valve, which discharges to the liquid radwaste
system (WLS) effluent holdup tanks (EHTs), to prevent overpressure in the RNS pump
discharge line that could occur if the three check valves and the motor-operated CIV leaked
back to the low-pressure portions of the RNS.
The RNS design also includes an instrumentation channel that indicates pressure in each RNS
pump suction line, and a high-pressure alarm is provided in the MCR to alert the operator to a
condition of rising RCS pressure that could eventually exceed the RNS design pressure.  The
motor-operated pressure isolation valves also have remote position indications in the MCR.  In
Generic Issues
20-52
addition, these pressure isolation valves are specified in DCD Tier 2, Table 3.9-18, to be
subject to TS LCO 3.4.16, which requires the leakage of each RCS PIV to be within limits with
leak testing in accordance with SR 3.4.16.1.  Based on the above information, the staff
concludes that the RNS design meets the requirements of SECY-90-016.
Chemical and Volume Control System/Makeup Systems 
DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.6 provides a detailed description of the design, functions, and
operations of the AP1000 chemical and volume control system (CVS).  The purification flow
path of the CVS is a high-pressure, closed-loop design, which is entirely within the containment
and, therefore, is of no ISLOCA concern.  The potential contributors to an ISLOCA are the
portions of the CVS located outside the containment (i.e., the letdown line to the liquid radwaste
system and the makeup system).
The CVS makeup pumps operate intermittently to make up for RCS leakage.  The pumps start
and stop automatically when the pressurizer level reaches the bottom and the top of the normal
level band, respectively.  The makeup pumps take suction from either the boric acid tank, or the
demineralized water storage tank (DWST), and inject into the CVS purification loop return
stream.  The makeup pumps can also take suction from the waste holdup tanks or the spent
fuel pool.  The makeup line from the makeup pump discharge to the RCS has a design
pressure greater than or equal to the RCS design pressure.  However, the pump suction line
piping and associated components are low-pressure segments, with the URS less than the
RCS operating pressure.  
In Section 3.3.3 of WCAP-15993, the applicant stated that it is not practical to design the
low-pressure portions of the makeup suction piping to higher design pressure.  It is not practical
to have a high design pressure for large tanks, such as the boric acid tank which are vented to
the atmosphere, as well as the piping directly connected to these atmospheric tanks up to the
first isolation valve.  The suction lines each contain a check valve that separates the suction
piping from a large atmospheric tank.  These check valves are designed to open on low
differential pressure and have a high tendency to leak.  The suction lines contain relief valves
that protect the low-pressure portions of the piping from overpressure in the event of leaking
check valves in the discharge line or thermal expansion caused by a loss of miniflow cooling. 
The relief valves direct any leakage from the discharge line check valves to the WLS EHTs,
which are designed to handle radioactive fluids.  The EHT levels are monitored by remote
instrumentation.  
The passage of the high-pressure reactor coolant to the CVS makeup suction is possible only
when the makeup pumps are not running, and only if failures or leakage of multiple check
valves on the makeup pump discharge side occurs.  A high-pressure alarm exists in the pump
suction line to alert the operator of overpressurization.  In the event of a suction-side
overpressurization, the makeup pumps can be operated to terminate overpressurizing the
suction piping.  If the makeup pumps did not start, the makeup line CIVs would automatically
close to terminate the ISLOCA.  In addition, the purification loop inlet isolation valves would also
be closed upon a safeguards actuation signal.  These multiple, safety-related isolation valves
prevent an ISLOCA in the makeup suction line.  As specified in DCD Tier 2, Table 3.9-16, the
purification inlet stop valves and the purification return line stop valve and check valve are
subject to leak testing.  These stop valves are provided with position indication in the control
room.  In addition, the makeup line CIVs also have the capability for leak testing and are

provided with valve position indication in the control room at all times.  The staff finds that these
protection measures meet the intent of the staff’s ISLOCA position, as stated in SECY-90-016.
CVS Letdown/Liquid Radwaste System
The CVS letdown line connects to the high-pressure purification loop inside containment. 
Immediately downstream of this connection is a high-pressure, multistage letdown orifice, which
reduces pressure in the letdown line from the RCS operating pressure to below the design
pressure of the low-pressure portion of the letdown line.  Around the letdown orifice is a bypass
line containing a locked-closed manual isolation valve that is opened only at shutdown when the
RCS is depressurized to provide sufficient letdown flow, when required.  The letdown line is
then equipped with two safety-related, normally-closed, fail-closed CIVs where it penetrates
containment to the WLS degasifier package and EHTs.  The letdown line down to and including
the outboard CIV has a design pressure of 17,130 kPa (2,485 psig).  Downstream of the
outboard CIV, the WLS letdown line is a low-pressure portion and, therefore, does not meet the
RCS URS criteria.
In Section 3.2.3 of WCAP-15993, the applicant contended that it is not practical to design the
low-pressure portions of the letdown line to a higher design pressure.  The WLS EHTs are large
atmospheric tanks and cannot be designated to a higher design pressure.  In addition, the
letdown line, which is routed to the degasifier package or the EHTs, and the degasifier
package, which discharges directly to the WLS EHTs, cannot be designed to a higher design
pressure.  The CVS letdown system includes the following features to meet the ISLOCA
criteria:  

The pressure drop across the CVS letdown orifice protects the WLS from
overpressurization during letdown operations by reducing the pressure in the WLS.

In case of an inadvertent valve closure in the WLS during letdown, a relief valve, which
discharges directly to the EHT, is provided that would protect the WLS from
overpressurization.

Due to the letdown orifice, a break in the WLS during letdown from the CVS would result
in an RCS leak that is within the capability of the normal makeup system.

If an ISLOCA should occur, it would be terminated by automatic isolation of the two
purification loop isolation valves and two letdown isolation valves upon a low pressurizer
level or a safeguards actuation signal.

The letdown line CIVs have the capability for leak testing and have valve position
indication in the control room at all times.

The WLS degasifier column contains a high-pressure alarm that would warn the control
room operators that the WLS pressure was approaching the design pressure.
In addition, as discussed previously, the purification inlet and return stop valves and check
valve are subject to leak testing.  The staff finds that the CVS letdown piping meets the staff’s
ISLOCA position, as stated in SECY-90-016. 
Generic Issues
20-54
Primary Sampling System
The primary sampling system (PSS) collects representative samples of fluids from the RCS,
and associated auxiliary system process streams, and the containment atmosphere for analysis
by the plant operating staff.  Section 3.4 of WCAP-15993 provides an ISLOCA evaluation of the
PSS.  The PSS lines consist of small, 0.64-cm (0.25-in.) pipes.  The whole PSS is designed to
full RCS pressure and temperature, with the exception of the eductor water storage tank and its
drainage and level indication lines, eductor supply pump seal, and demineralized water supply
line.  These low-pressure portions have design pressures with the URS below the RCS
operating pressure.  The applicant contended that it is not practical to design the low-pressure
portion of the PSS to a higher design pressure because these portions are at atmospheric
pressure and connect to the low-pressure demineralized water transfer and storage system
(DWS).  Designing the eductor water storage tank to high pressure to meet ISLOCA criteria
would require the DWS to be designed for high pressure, which is not practical.
The PSS is connected to the RCS through the local sample points in the RCS hot legs,
pressurizer vapor, and liquid spaces.  Each of these sampling connection lines contains a
flow-restricting orifice that limits the flow from the RCS in the event of a sample line break, and
reduces the pressure in the sampling lines during sampling operations.  Each sampling line also
contains a normally closed isolation valve before being connected to a common header.  The
common header then penetrates the containment with two normally closed CIVs, which are also
PIVs, and will be isolated upon safeguards signal if open for sampling operation.  The sampling
line then connects to a sample cooler and the sample bottles.
During sampling operations, flow limiting orifices plus the small diameter of the PSS lines limit
flow to approximately 0.5 gpm, and the PSS lines are never pressurized above the design
pressure of the low-pressure portions of the PSS.  The PSS high-pressure/low-pressure
interface occurs within the grab sample panel, which is a standard panel with design features to
prevent backflow and overpressurization of the low-pressure portions of the system.  Even in
the unlikely event that overpressurization occurred, leakage flow from the RCS would be well
within the makeup capability of the normally operating makeup system.  At any time, the
operator would be able to isolate the leakage by closing the PSS CIVs.  The CIVs have remote
position indication in the control room and are subject to the CIV leakage test.  In addition, the
leakage from these CIVs through the 0.64-cm (0.25-in.) pipes would be small.  Therefore, the
staff finds that the PSS design meets the intent of the ISLOCA criteria, as stated in
SECY-90-016.
Solid Radwaste System
The solid radwaste system (WSS), which provides storage facilities for both wet and dry solid
wastes prior to and subsequent to processing and packaging, is connected to the high-pressure
CVS demineralizers to facilitate transfer of spent resin from the CVS demineralizers to the
spent resin storage tanks (SRSTs).  The spent resin header connects to each of the three CVS
demineralizers with an individual normally closed isolation valve, and then penetrates
containment with two normally closed CIVs to the SRSTs outside.  A manual valve is placed
downstream of the outboard CIV to isolate the downstream piping to facilitate CIV leak testing. 
The portion of piping downstream of the manual isolation valve is a low-pressure design with a
URS below the RCS operating pressure.  Section 3.5.2 of WCAP-15993 asserts that it is not
practical or necessary to design the WSS to a higher design pressure because the system
Generic Issues
20-55
contains many low-pressure components, such as the SRST and resin transfer and mixing
pumps. 
The WSS spent resin line is normally isolated by locked-closed manual CIVs, which are
administratively controlled, have position indications in the control room, and are leak tested in
accordance with the IST plan described in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.6.  The CVS demineralizers
are inside containment and normally circulate reactor coolant at RCS pressure.  As such, resin
transfer operations are conducted only during refueling operations when the RCS is fully
depressurized.  During normal power operation, the only pathway to the low-pressure portion of
the WSS is for all three closed isolation valves to fail.  Should that extremely unlikely event
happen, the recirculation loop isolation valves can be closed to isolate the purification loop and
the WSS from the RCS.  In addition, downstream of the inboard CIV in the resin transfer line,
there is a relief valve which discharges to the WLS containment sump inside containment. 
Therefore, the staff finds that the WSS spent resin lines are not required to be designed to a
higher design pressure. 
Demineralized Water Transfer and Storage System
DWS receives water from the demineralized water treatment system, and provides a reservoir
of demineralized water to supply the condensate storage tank and for distribution throughout
the plant.  DCD Tier 2, Section 9.2.4 provides the design and functional details of the DWS. 
The demineralized water transfer pumps take suction from the DWST and supply water through
a catalytic oxygen reduction unit to the demineralized water distribution header.  From this
header, demineralized water is supplied to various systems in the plant.  One DWS supply line
penetrates containment to a supply header inside containment, which serves as the DWS
interface with the PSS and the CVS demineralizers.  The DWS provides demineralized water to
the PSS to flush the PSS lines prior to RCS sampling, and to the CVS demineralizers to sluice
resin to the WSS.
The DWS is a low-pressure system design with a URS below RCS operating pressure. 
However, the only possible overpressurization pathways from the RCS are the connections to
the PSS and the CVS demineralizers inside containment.  Overpressurization of the DWS can
only occur if there are multiple failures and misalignments of isolation valves and check valves
in the high-pressure systems.  The DWS supply header inside containment has a relief valve to
preclude the possibility of overpressurizing the DWS.  In addition, an overpressurization of the
DWS would most likely result in the rupture of the DWS header inside containment.  Therefore,
the staff finds that it is not a concern for ISLOCA. 
Conclusions
The staff concludes that the AP1000 design is consistent with the staff position discussed in
SECY-90-016 regarding ISLOCA.  Therefore, Issue 105 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 106:  Piping and Use of Highly Combustible Gases in Vital Areas
Issue 106 addresses the release of combustible gases from leaks or pipe breaks resulting in
combustible gas accumulation in buildings containing safety-related equipment.  NUREG-1364,
“Regulatory Analysis for the Resolution of Generic Safety Issue 106:  Piping and the Use of
Highly Combustible Gases in Vital Areas,” specifically addresses Issue 106 and provides
Generic Issues
20-56
alternatives for prevention of, detection of, and protection against hazards associated with the
release of combustible gases used, stored, and piped through safety-related areas and areas
that expose safety-related equipment.
As discussed in NUREG-0933 and NUREG-1364, except for hydrogen, most combustible
gases are used in limited quantities and for relatively short periods of time.  Hydrogen is stored
in high-pressure storage vessels and is supplied to various systems in the auxiliary building
through small-diameter piping.  A leak or break in this piping could result in an explosive
mixture of air and hydrogen, posing a potential loss of safety-related equipment. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, Issue 106, the applicant specified that the AP1000 design
uses small amounts of combustible gases for normal plant operations.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 9.3.2, discusses the plant gas system.  Most such gases are stated to be used in
limited quantities and associated with plant functions or activities that do not jeopardize
safety-related equipment.  These gases are found in areas of the plant that are removed from
the nuclear island, except the hydrogen supply line to the CVS inside containment which is the
only system on the island that uses hydrogen gas.
Hydrogen gas is supplied to the CVS from a single hydrogen bottle.  The release of the
contents of an entire bottle of hydrogen in the most limiting building volumes (both inside
containment and in the auxiliary building) would not result in a volume percent of hydrogen
large enough to reach a detonable level.  DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, also specifies that the
CVS hydrogen supply piping is routed through the turbine building, into the auxiliary building,
and then into containment.  The hydrogen supply line is routed through the piping/valve room
on Elevation 100’ of the auxiliary building.  The piping valve penetration room in the auxiliary
building on Elevation 100’ is designed as a 3-hour fire zone.  DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.2,
specifies that the hydrogen gas portion of the plant system is a packaged system consisting of
a liquid hydrogen storage tank and vaporizer to supply hydrogen gas to the main generator for
generator cooling, to the demineralized water transfer and storage system to support removal
of dissolved oxygen, and to other miscellaneous services.  The hydrogen supply package
system is located outdoors at the hydrogen storage tank area.  The turbine building does not
house any safety-related systems or equipment.  The containment has hydrogen sensors to
detect hydrogen leaks.  The containment hydrogen concentration monitoring subsystem is
designed as Class 1E and seismic Category I (see DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.4.1 ).
The BTP Chemical Engineering Branch (CMEB) 9.5-1, Section C.5.d, “Control of
Combustibles,” specifies that care should be taken to locate high-pressure storage containers
with the long axis parallel to building walls.  In addition, BTP CMEB 9.5-1 specifies that
hydrogen lines in safety-related areas be either designed to seismic Class 1 requirements, or
sleeved such that the outer pipe is directly vented to the outside, or equipped with excess flow
valves so that in case of a line break, the hydrogen concentration in the affected area will not
exceed 2 percent.  The applicant specified in DCD Tier 2, Table 9.5.1-1, that the AP1000
design complies with Section C.5.d of BTP CMEB 9.5.1.  
In addition, in DCD Tier 2, Section 9.5.1, the applicant referenced National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA), Standard 50A, “Gaseous Hydrogen Systems at Consumers Sites,”
1999 Edition.  DCD Tier 2, Table 9.5.1-3, identifies no exceptions to the referenced NFPA
Standard.  Therefore, based on the compliance of the AP1000 with the guidance provided in
BTP 9.5.1 and the applicable NFPA standard, Issue 106 is considered resolved.

Issue 113:  Dynamic Qualification Testing of Large-Bore Hydraulic Snubbers
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 113 addresses the staff’s concerns in 1985 that no
requirements existed for dynamic qualification testing or surveillance testing of large-bore
hydraulic snubbers (LBHSs) (i.e., greater than 222411 Newtons (N) (50 (1000 pounds force)
(kips)) load rating).  The staff was concerned about the integrity of the SG lower support
structures when subjected to a seismic event.  However, this issue was applicable to all SSCs
that rely on large-bore hydraulic snubbers for restraint from seismic loads and other dynamic
loads, such as water hammer and fluid blowdown caused by HELBs.
LBHSs are active mechanical devices used to restrain safety-related piping and equipment
during seismic or other dynamic events, yet also allow for sufficient piping component flexibility
to accommodate system expansion and contraction from such thermal transients as normal
plant heatups and cooldowns.  Dynamic testing and periodic functional testing are important to
verify that the LBHSs are properly designed and maintained for the life of the plant.  Issue 113
was resolved with no new requirements, although in a draft RG, SC-708-4, “Qualification and
Acceptance Test for Snubbers Used in Systems Important to Safety,” the staff provided
recommendations for testing hydraulic snubbers used in the design of new plants.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 plant uses significantly
fewer hydraulic snubbers than do currently operating plants.  It further stated that in addition to
the recommendations in the NRC draft RG, testing requirements have been established in
ANSI/ASME OM Code, “Code for Operation and Maintenance of Nuclear Power Plants.” 
Because ANSI/ASME OM Code, Subsection ISTD, is referenced as an alternative requirement
for IST of snubbers in 10 CFR 50.55a(b)(3)(v), this is an acceptable commitment for periodic
functional testing of LBHSs, and is in accordance with applicable portions of
10 CFR 50.55a(g)(4).  DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.3.4.3, provides a commitment to include
dynamic testing as a part of the production operability tests for all snubbers.  The production
operability tests for LBHSs include (1) a full service Level D load test to verify sufficient load
capacity, (2) testing at full load capacity to verify proper bleed with the control valve closed,
(3) testing to verify the control valve closes within the specified velocity range, and (4) testing to
demonstrate that breakaway and drag loads are within the design limits.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.9.8.3, identifies the requirements for the COL applicant information on snubber
operability testing.  Section 3.9.3.3 of this report discusses further the staff’s evaluation of this
issue.  Based on the staff review of the information provided in DCD Tier 2 relative to periodic
functional testing and dynamic qualification testing of LBHSs, the staff concludes that Issue 113
is resolved for the AP1000 design. 
Issue 120:  On-Line Testability of Protection Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 120 addresses requirements for conducting at-power
testing of safety system components without impairing plant operation.  The staff raised this
issue because it found, in the review of several plant TS in 1985, that some older plants did not
provide as complete a degree of on-line testing as other plants.  GDC 21, “Protection System
Reliability and Testability,” includes the requirements for on-line testing of protection systems. 
These requirements apply to both the RPS and the engineered safety features actuation
system (ESFAS).  A protection system with two-out-of-four logic that can operate with one
channel in bypass, and the remaining three channels in a two-out-of-three logic configuration
meets this requirement.  This issue was resolved with no new requirements.
Generic Issues
20-58
Guidance for this issue is provided in RG 1.22, “Periodic Testing of Protection System Actuation
Functions,” RG 1.118, “Periodic Testing of Electric Power and Protection Systems,” and IEEE
Std 338.  Conformance to these documents ensures that the AP1000 protection systems
(including logic, actuation devices, and associated actuated equipment) will be designed to
permit testing while the plant is at power without adversely affecting plant operation.
The AP1000 protection system has a two-out-of-four logic configuration that can operate with
one channel in bypass, and the remaining three channels in a two-out-of-three logic
configuration.  This meets the requirements in GDC 21 for on-line testing.  The AP1000's
design provision for testing of the protection system conforms to the guidelines in RGs 1.22 and
1.118.  The staff concludes that Issue 120 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 121:  Hydrogen Control for Large, Dry PWR Containments
The AP1000 DSER regarding Issue 121 stated the following:
This issue remains open because DCD Tier 2 does not comply with current regulations
for the control of combustible gas in containment during accidents.
The NRC has proposed major changes to 10 CFR 50.44, and related changes to
10 CFR 50.34 and 10 CFR 52.47, along with the creation of a new rule, 10 CFR 50.46a
(see 67 FR 50374, issued August 2, 2002).  These proposed changes are meant to risk-
inform the combustible gas control requirements, and constitute significant relaxations
of the requirements.  The staff plans to finalize the rule changes during 2003.
The applicant wrote DCD Tier 2 in anticipation of these rule changes.  As such, it is not
in compliance with the current, more restrictive regulations.  Furthermore, until the
proposed rule changes are final and effective, the staff cannot know for certain if the
DCD will comply with the revised rule.  Therefore, the issue of containment combustible
gas control, as well as Issue 121, must remain open at this time.  This is Open
Item 6.2.5-1.
Subsequent to the publication of the DSER, the NRC revised its regulations regarding the
control of combustible gas in containment.  The revised regulations were published on
September 16, 2003, and became effective on October 16, 2003.  The NRC has extensively
revised 10 CFR 50.44, “Combustible Gas Control for Nuclear Power Reactors,” made
associated changes to Subsections 50.34 and 52.47, and added a new section,
Subsection 50.46a, “Acceptance Criteria for Reactor Coolant System Venting Systems.”  The
revisions apply to current power reactor licensees, and also consolidate combustible gas control
regulations for future power reactor applicants and licensees.  The revised rules eliminate the
requirements for hydrogen recombiners and hydrogen purge systems, and relax the
requirements for hydrogen and oxygen monitoring equipment to make them commensurate
with their risk significance.
The ability of the AP1000 design to comply with the hydrogen control requirements of 10 CFR
50.44 is documented in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.4.  The staff’s evaluation of the ability of the
AP1000 design to comply with the hydrogen control requirements of 10 CFR 50.44 are
documented in Section 6.2.5 of this report.
Generic Issues
20-59
Concerning equipment survivability, Westinghouse addressed this issue in DCD Tier 2,
Appendix 19D and in Appendix D to the AP1000 PRA, and the staff’s evaluation is documented
in Section 19.2.3.3.7 of this report.
The AP1000 has been provided with a system for hydrogen control that meets the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.44 as evaluated in Sections 6.2.5 and 19.2.3.3.7 of this report.  Therefore, Open
Item 6.2.5-1 is closed and Issue 121 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 122.2:  Initiating Feed and Bleed
 
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 122.2 investigated the findings of the NRC’s 1985
inspection of the loss-of-feedwater event at Davis-Besse which occurred on June 9, 1985.  The
issue addresses the adequacy of emergency procedures, operator training, and available plant
monitoring systems for determining the need to initiate feed-and-bleed cooling following the
loss of the SG heat sink (i.e., loss of feedwater).  In an analysis of the loss-of-feedwater event,
the staff found that operators were hesitant to initiate feed-and-bleed operations, and that the
control room instrumentation was inadequate to alert operators to the need to initiate feed and
bleed.  A loss-of-feedwater event, in combination with a failure to diagnose and take corrective
actions (i.e., initiate feed and bleed), would result in a loss of core cooling.
In the final safety evaluation report for AP600 design, the staff reported that the Westinghouse
Emergency Response Guidelines (ERGs) include the feed and bleed emergency guidelines
(AFR-H.1, “Response to Loss of Heat Sink”), are reviewed, and found acceptable.  In
Chapter 18 of this report, the staff has concluded that the Westinghouse ERGs for AP600
design are applicable to AP1000 design.  Therefore, the staff concluded that Issue 122.2
regarding initiating feed and bleed is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 124:  Auxiliary Feedwater System Reliability
Is response to the loss-of-feedwater event at the Davis-Besse plant in 1985, Issue 124 in
NUREG-0933 addresses increasing the reliability of the auxiliary or emergency feedwater
system to 1E-04 unavailability/demand.  In 1985, operating experience, as well as staff and
industry studies, indicated that these systems failed at a high rate.  The function of the AFWS in
the majority of operating plants is to supply feedwater water to the secondary side of the SGs
during system fill, normal plant heatup, hot standby, and cold shutdown conditions.  The AFWS
also functions following a loss of normal feedwater flow, including loss resulting from an offsite
power failure.  It also supplies feedwater to the SGs following accidents such as a main
feedwater line break or a main steamline break.  Therefore, the reliability of the AFWS is
important to plant safety.
The NRC investigation of the Davis-Besse event indicated that the potential inability to remove
decay heat from the reactor core was the result of the questionable reliability of the EFWS
caused by any or all of the following circumstances:

loss of all EFW as a result of common-mode failure of the pump discharge isolation
valves to open

excessive delay in recovering EFW because of a difficulty in restarting the pump
steam-driven turbines once they tripped
Generic Issues
20-60

interruption of EFW flow because of failures in steamline break and feedwater line break
accident mitigation features
In addition, the investigation of the event indicated that (1) a two-train system with a steam
turbine-driven EFW pump may not be able to achieve the desired level of reliability, and
(2) provisions to automatically isolate EFW from an SG affected by a main steamline or
feedwater line break may tend to increase the risk that adequate DHR is not available, rather
than decrease it.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that this issue is not applicable to the
AP1000 design because the design does not have a safety-related AFWS.  The PXS  will
provide the safety-related function of cooling the RCS in the event of loss of feedwater to the
SGs.  The SUFWS, which has no safety-related function beyond containment isolation,
provides the SGs with feedwater during startup, hot standby, and cooldown, and when the main
feedwater pumps are not available.
The staff finds that the SUFWS is not a safety-related system and does not have to perform the
same safety function as the AFWS.  Therefore, Issue 124 is resolved for the AP1000 design.  
Issue 125.II.7:  Reevaluate Provision to Automatically Isolate Feedwater From Steam 
             Generator During a Line Break
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 125.II.7 addresses the long-term actions from
NUREG-1154, “Loss of Main and Auxiliary Feedwater Event at the Davis-Besse Plant on
June 9, 1985,” and the Executive Director for Operations (EDO) memorandum dated August 5,
1985, on the loss-of-feedwater event at Davis-Besse on June 6, 1985.  Issue 125.II.7
addresses the need for licensees to reassess the benefits of automatically isolating the EFWS
after a break in the secondary side of the SG.  For a typical PWR with automatic isolation (AI)
of the EFW (AI-EFW), a low-SG-pressure signal causes closure of the main steam isolation
valves (MSIVs) and isolation of EFW from the faulted SG during a steamline break.  AI-EFW
minimizes blowdown from the SG secondary-side line break and limits primary system
overcooling and the potential for return to criticality because of positive moderator reactivity
feedwater caused by overcooling of the RCS inventory.  If the EFW were not isolated, the peak
containment pressure for secondary-side breaks might exceed that caused by a large-break
LOCA, the design-basis event for the containment.
However, AI-EFW has a disadvantage.  If both channels of the controlling isolation logic system
were to spontaneously actuate, the availability of EFW would be lost and the MSIVs would
close.  For the plants using turbine-driven main feedwater pumps, these pumps would be lost
following the closure of the MSIVs and the loss of steam.  This loss would result in the loss of
the secondary-side heat sink.  The capability to lock out the isolation logic is necessary to
preclude this event.
The staff determined (as stated in NUREG-0933) that for a new plant, the design does not need
to include automatic isolation of EFW following a steamline break or feedwater line break,
provided that the results of the analysis of the secondary-side line break and the containment
analysis meet the criteria in the appropriate SRP Section of NUREG-0800.  Therefore,
Issue 125.II.7 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues

Issue 128:  Electrical Power System Reliability
Issue 128 addresses the reliability of onsite electrical systems and encompasses Issues 48, 49,
and A-30.  The staff has reviewed the applicant’s submittal and concludes that the AP1000
design addresses Issue 48, “LCO for Class 1E Vital Instrument Buses in Operating Reactors”;
Issue 49, “Interlocks and LCO for Class 1E Tie breakers”; and Issue A-30, “Adequacy of Safety
Related DC Power Supplies” for the following reasons:

Issue 48—the applicant provided the LCO in the event of a loss of one or more Class 1E
120 V ac vital instrument buses and associated inverters.  The staff finds this LCO
acceptable.  

Issue 49—The AP1000 design does not include Class 1E tie breakers.

Issue A-30—The staff has evaluated the Class 1E dc distribution system design for the
aspects addressed by Issue A-30 in Section 8.3.2.1 of this report and concludes that it is
acceptable. 
Therefore, Issue 128 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 130:  Essential Service Water Pump Failures at Multiplant Sites
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 130 addresses the vulnerability of Byron Unit 1 to
core-melt sequences in the absence of the availability of Unit 2.  While Unit 2 was under
construction, it was necessary to make a third service water pump available to Unit 1 via a
crosstie with one of the two Unit 2 essential service water (ESW) pumps.  This issue raised
concerns relative to multiplant units that have only two ESW pumps per plant, but have crosstie
capabilities.  A limited survey of the applicant’s plants helped to identify the generic applicability
of vulnerabilities of multiplant configurations with only two ESW pumps per plant.  In the
multiplant configurations identified (approximately 16 plants), all plants can share ESW pumps
via a crosstie between plants.  Additional efforts to resolve this issue included (1) a limited
survey of the applicant’s plants to determine the generic applicability of similar multiplant
configurations with two ESW pumps per plant and whether crosstie capabilities existed, (2) a
survey of B&W, and Asea Brown Boveri Company-Combustion Engineering (ABB-CE) plants to
identify similar multiplant configurations, and (3) a survey of single-unit plants to determine if
similar ESW vulnerabilities existed.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that this issue is not applicable to the
AP1000 design because the plant design is for a single independent plant that does not share
or crosstie systems or components with another plant.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 3.1.1, the
applicant stated that if more than one unit is built on the same site, none of the safety-related
systems will be shared.  This is part of COL Action Item 20.1.4-1.  The staff finds this
acceptable for the AP1000 design.
Therefore, Issue 130 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-62
Issue 135:  Steam Generator and Steamline Overfill
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 135 was initiated in 1986 to integrate various SG
programs and related issues, including water hammer, eddy current testing, and steamline
overfill consequences.  Overfill is defined as water entering the main steamline caused by
excessive feedwater flow resulting from control system failure or an SGTR.  This issue was
expected to provide a better understanding of SG and secondary-side integrity, including the
effects of water hammer on secondary system components and piping, as well as the resultant
radiological consequences.  Because the staff concluded that SGTR and steamline overfill
events are relatively low risks, this issue was resolved and no new requirements were
established.  This position is documented in NUREG-0933 and NUREG/CR-4893, “Technical
Findings Report for Generic Issue 135:  SG and Steamline Overfill Issues,” dated May 1991.  A
subissue of Issue 135 is the improved eddy current testing of SG tubes.  The staff deferred this
subissue to the development of a revision to RG 1.83, “Inservice Inspection of Pressurized
Water Reactor SG Tubes.”
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant addressed Issue 135 and the four tasks that
comprise it, as discussed in NUREG-0933.  The evaluation of each task is provided below:
•
Task 1 on Code and regulatory requirements—DCD Tier 2, Appendix 1A, which
discusses the level of conformance with RG 1.83, states that the AP1000 design
essentially conforms to the regulatory guidance except where state-of-the-art advances
have enhanced ISI techniques.  Specifically, as stated in DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.2.5,
the SGs permit access to the tubes for inspection, repair, and plugging in accordance
with RG 1.83.  The AP1000 SGs include features to enhance robotic inspection of tubes
without manned entry.  As discussed in Sections 5.2.4 and 5.4.2 of this report, the COL
applicant is responsible for the development of the SG tube PSI and ISI programs.  SG
tube integrity is verified in accordance with this surveillance program, as discussed in
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.15.  The programs are plant-specific and are contained in
Section 5.5.4, “Steam Generator (SG) Tube Surveillance Program,” of the TS found in
DCD Tier 2, Chapter 16, and found it to be acceptable, as discussed in Section 5.4.2.2
of this report.  Plant-specific changes made by a COL applicant to this surveillance
program in the technical specifications will be reviewed by the staff individually for each
license application referencing the AP1000 DC against the staff’s regulatory criteria in
place at the time of its review.  As discussed in Issue A-3, this is designated as COL
Action Item 20.3-1.
•
Task 2 on SRP Section 15.6.3, “Radiological Consequences of SG Tube Failure”—DCD
Tier 2, Section 15.6.3.1.4, discusses anticipated operator recovery actions and the
effects of those actions in the mitigation of an SGTR event.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 15.6.3.2, describes the automatic SG overfill protection, and DCD Tier 2,
Section 7.2, describes the control logic.
•
Task 3 on several generic issues—A compilation of the generic issues are addressed by
the following DCD Tier 2 sections:
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 15.6.3, discusses radiological consequences.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 15.6.3, discusses the SGTR design basis.
Generic Issues
20-63
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.2.5 and Appendix 1A discuss the supplemental tube
inspections.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.2.4.3, discusses denting criteria.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 7.5, discusses safety-related display information.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 7.3.1.2.5, discusses RCP trip.
–
DCD Tier 2, Sections 7.5 and 18.8 discuss control room design and design
process.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 18.9, discusses the development of EOPs.
–
DCD Tier 2, Chapter 13, discusses organization responses as part of the COL
application.
–
DCD Tier 2, Section 7.7.1.6, discusses reactor coolant pressure control.

Task 4 on SG overfill, carryover, and water hammer—DCD Tier 2, Section 15.6.3.2,
discusses SG overfill, water carryover, and water hammer; DCD Tier 2, Section 7.2
discusses the control logic.
Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue 135 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 142:  Leakage Through Electrical Isolators in Instrumentation Circuits
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 142 addresses observations made by the staff in 1987
during evaluation tests for the safety parameter display system (SPDS).  These tests revealed
that for electrical transients below maximum credible levels, a relatively high level of noise could
pass through certain types of isolation devices and be transmitted to safety-related circuitry.  In
some cases, the amount of energy transmitted through the isolator could damage or seriously
degrade the performance of the Class 1E components; in other cases, the electrically
generated noise on the circuit could cause the isolation device to give a false output.  This
issue addresses electrical isolators used to maintain electrical separation between Class 1E
and non-Class 1E electrical systems and to prevent malfunctions in the non-Class 1E circuits
from degrading the performance of Class 1E circuits.
In resolving this issue, the staff determined from operating experience that isolation devices
perform satisfactorily in the operating environment and have not been exposed to failure
mechanisms that resulted in signal leakage.  This determination was made, however, on the
basis that current plants predominantly use electromechanical controls and may not be
applicable to instrumentation and control (I&C) systems with digital or electronic components. 
This issue was resolved with no new requirements established.
DCD Tier 2, Sections 7.1.2.10, “Isolation Devices,”  7.7.1.11, “Diverse Actuation System,” and
WCAP-15776, “Safety Criteria for the AP1000 Instrument and Control Systems,” Section 3.9,
“Conformance to the Requirements to Maintain Independence Between Safety Systems and
Other Interconnected Equipment (Paragraph 5.6.3.1 of IEEE Std 603-1991, “IEEE Standard
Generic Issues
20-64
Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations”) describe the use of
isolation devices in the AP1000 I&C architecture.  The isolation devices are tested to conform to
design requirements.  This testing will identify the devices potentially susceptible to electrical
leakage.  The applicant further stated that the COL license holder is responsible for
implementing an annual program to inspect and test all electronic isolators between Class 1E
and non-Class 1E systems.  This is COL Action Item 20.3-2.
The use of fiber optic data links eliminates electrically conductive paths between receiving and
transmitting terminals, as well as the potential for electrically generated noise caused by
leakage through an isolator.  These communication links also use extensive testing and error
checking to minimize erroneous transmissions.  DCD Tier 2, Section 7.1.2.8, “Communications
Functions,” describes these data links.  The electromagnetic design, testing, and qualification is
performed as described in WCAP-15776, Section 2.6 “Design Basis: Range of Conditions for
Safety System Performance (Paragraph 4.7 of IEEE Std 603-1991). 
The diverse actuation system (DAS), which is described in DCD Tier 2, Section 7.7.1.11, uses
sensors that are separate from those being used by the protection system and the control
system.  This prohibits failures from propagating to the other plant systems through the use of
shared sensors.
Based on the above discussion, as well as COL Action Item 20.3-2, the staff considers
Issue 142 to be resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 143:  Availability of Chilled-Water Systems and Room Cooling
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 143 addresses problems with safety system components
and control systems that have been experienced in recent years at several nuclear plants due
to a partial or total loss of the plant’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. 
Many of these problems exist because of (1) the desire to provide increased fire protection, and
(2) the need to avoid severe temperature changes in equipment control circuits.  Since the
Browns Ferry fire, considerable effort has been expended to improve the fire protection of
equipment required for safe shutdown.  Generally, this improvement has been accomplished by
enclosing the affected equipment in small, isolated rooms.  However, the result has been a
significant increase in the impact of the loss of room cooling.  Another problem resulting from
loss of room cooling is the advancement in control circuit design.  With the introduction of
electronic integrated circuits, plant control and safety have improved; however, these circuits
are more susceptible to damage from severe changes in temperature caused by the loss of
room cooling. 
It is believed that failures of air-cooling systems for areas housing key components, such as
RHR pumps, switchgear, and DGs, could contribute significantly to core-melt probability in
certain plants.  Because corrective measures are often taken at the affected plants once these
failures occur, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards believes that the impact of these
failures on the proper functioning of air-cooling systems has not been reflected in the final
PRAs of plants.  Thus, plants with similar, inherent deficiencies may not be aware of these
problems.
Operability of some safety-related components depends upon operation of HVAC and
chilled-water systems to remove heat from the rooms containing the components.  If
Generic Issues
20-65
chilled-water and HVAC systems are unavailable to remove heat, the ability of the safety
equipment within the rooms to operate as intended cannot be assured.
Issue 143 has not been generically resolved and is classified in NUREG-0933 as a high-safety
priority.  A possible solution to this issue would require a reevaluation of each plant’s room heat
load and heatup rate to locate areas in which the dependence of equipment operability on the
HVAC and room cooling may be reduced.  Although the total elimination of this dependence
may not be possible at all plants, this analysis would locate areas in which this dependence is
critical.  The critical dependencies and the ability to reduce them could be determined through
the use of a plant-specific PRA.  After the critical dependencies are identified, each plant would
implement procedural changes (to provide alternate cooling) to eliminate or reduce the
dependencies, where possible.  Hardware modifications may be needed for situations in which
a procedure change cannot be implemented to reduce a critical dependency.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that this issue does not apply to the
AP1000 design because the design does not rely on active safety systems to provide safe
shutdown of the plant.  A total loss of the HVAC system will not prevent a safe shutdown.  The
staff agrees with this statement.  Therefore, Issue 143 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 153:  Loss of Essential Service Water in LWRs
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 153 addressed the reliability of ESW systems and related
operating problems.  In a comprehensive NRC evaluation of operating experience related to
ESW systems (NUREG-1275, Volume 3, “Operating Experience Feedback Report,” dated
November 1988), a total of 980 operational events involving the ESW system were identified, of
which 12 resulted in complete loss of the ESW system.  Among the causes of failure and
degradation are (1) various fouling mechanisms (sediment deposition, biofouling, corrosion and
erosion, foreign material and debris intrusion), (2) ice effects, (3) single-failures and other
design deficiencies, (4) flooding, (5) multiple equipment failures, and (6) human and procedural
errors.
At each plant, the ESW system supplies cooling water to transfer heat from various
safety-related and non-safety-related systems and equipment to the UHS.  The ESW system is
needed in every phase of plant operations and, under accident conditions, supplies adequate
cooling water to systems and components that are important to safe plant shutdown or to
mitigate the consequences of the accident.  Under normal operating conditions, the ESW
system provides component and room cooling.  During shutdowns, it also ensures that the
residual heat is removed from the reactor core.  The ESW system may also supply makeup
water to the FPS, cooling towers, and water-treatment systems at a plant.
The design of the ESW system varies substantially from plant to plant, and the ESW system is
highly dependent on the NSSS.  As a result, generic solutions (if needed) are likely to be
different for PWRs and BWRs.  Possible solutions include (1) installation of a redundant intake
structure including a service water pump, (2) hardware changes to the ESW system,
(3) installation of a dedicated RCP seal cooling system, or (4) changes to TS or operational
procedures.
In the resolution of Issue 130 on ESW pump failures at multiplant sites, discussed earlier in this
section, the staff surveyed seven multiplant sites and found that the loss of the ESW system

could be a significant contributor to core-damage frequency.  The generic safety insights
gained from this study supported previous perceptions that ESW system configurations at other
multiplant and single-plant sites may also be significant contributors to plant risk and should
also be evaluated.  As a result, Issue 153 was identified to address all potential causes of ESW
system unavailability, except those that had been resolved by implementation of the
requirements in GL 89-13.
The staff resolved Issue 153 with no new requirements established for operating and new
plants.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.3, the applicant stated that this issue does not apply to the
AP1000 design because the design does not rely on the service water and component cooling
water systems to provide safety-related safe shutdown.  The staff agrees with this statement.
Therefore, Issue 153 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 163:  Multiple Steam Generator Tube Leakage
Issue 163, “Multiple SG Tube Leakage,” identified a safety concern associated with potential
multiple SG tube leaks triggered by a main steamline break (MSLB) outside containment that
cannot be isolated.  This sequence of events could lead to core damage resulting from the loss
of all primary system coolant and safety injection fluid in the refueling water storage tank.  The
NRC has given Issue 163 a high-priority ranking, and is working toward a resolution of the
issue. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9, “Compliance with Regulatory Criteria,” does not address this issue,
except that DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2 indicates that Issue 163 is unresolved pending generic
resolution.  In response to a staff question (RAI 440.184, Revision 1, applicant letter
DCP/NRC1566, April 7, 2003), the applicant stated that the issue should be considered closed
for the AP1000 based on the following evaluation.
The AP1000 plant response to an MSLB scrams the reactor automatically and removes decay
heat via the intact SG or the PRHR HX.  If the MSLB is not isolated, the RCS will continue to
lose coolant after shutdown through leaking SG tubes, and the plant responds to the scenario
as though it were an SBLOCA.  The CMTs drain and produce a low-level signal.  The plant
protection and monitoring system depressurizes the RCS via the ADS.  The core remains
covered throughout the scenario.  Once the RCS is depressurized to the containment pressure,
the much lower containment pressure stops the leakage through the leaking SG tubes. 
Therefore, no long-term core uncovery is expected.  Also, the elevation at the high point of the
steam line is approximately 80 feet higher than the elevation of the ADS-4 discharge. 
Therefore, once the ADS-4 is actuated and the RCS depressurized, the leakage from the
primary side through the SG tubes will stop.  Based on this analysis, the applicant concluded
that the ADS-4 operation would reduce any postulated primary-to-secondary leakage for a
hypothetical MSLB followed by SG tube leakage.
The staff agrees that the issue should be closed for the AP1000 design.  Issue 163 concerns
the possibility that a multiple SGTR, resulting from an MSLB and degraded SG tubes, could
result in core damage due to depletion of the reactor coolant and safety injection fluid in the
refueling water storage tank.  For the AP1000 design, an SGTR is mitigated using the PXS,
initially through the PRHR HX, and the CMTs.  After the CMTs drain to the low level to actuate
Generic Issues
20-67
the ADS, the RCS depressurization would result in gravity injection from the IRWST, and
eventually from the containment recirculation.  The scenario that the safety injection from the
refueling water storage tank, which is outside the containment in the existing plants, will be
depleted to result in core damage is not likely for the AP1000 design because the IRWST and
containment recirculation will continue to provide core cooling.
Since the resolution of Issue 163 is an ongoing NRC effort, any future requirements for the
resolution of this issue will be required of the COL applicant, if applicable to the AP1000 design.
Therefore, Issue 163 is resolved for the AP1000.
Issue 168:  Equipment Qualification of Electric Equipment
This issue relates to the effects of cable aging and whether the licensing basis for older plants
should be reassessed or enhanced in connections with license renewal, or whether it should be
reassessed for the current license term.  This issue is not applicable to the AP1000 design, and
COL actions on the AP1000 will be based upon current cable requirements.  Therefore,
reassessments are not required for the AP1000.  This is COL Action Item 20.1.4-1.
Therefore, Issue 168 is resolved for the AP1000.
Issue 185:  Control of Recriticality Following Small-Break LOCA in PWRs
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue 185 addresses the possibility of a recriticality because of
the potential for an unborated water slug to enter the core following an SBLOCA event. 
Specifically, the issue was identified following an NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation
(NRR) request for reconsideration of the safety priority ranking of GSI-22, “Inadvertent Boron
Dilution Events,” based on new information on high-burnup fuel and new calculations provided
by the B&W Owner’s Group (B&WOG).  In particular, reactivity insertion tests conducted on
high-burnup fuel have indicated that high-burnup fuel may be more susceptible to reactivity
events than previously expected.  In addition, calculations conducted by the B&WOG have
predicted that prompt criticality is possible, and that significant heat generation under these
conditions may result from SBLOCAs.  
The applicant has addressed this issue in the context of the AP1000 design, as described in its
response to RAI 440.099, Revision 1.
As described in Section 15.2.8 of this report, the staff completed its review of the SBLOCA
deboration issue for the AP1000 design and concluded that the AP1000 design is acceptable
with respect to the deboration issue.  Therefore, the staff considers Issue 185 resolved for the
AP1000 design.  
Issue 189:  Susceptibility of Ice Condenser and Mark III Containments to Early Failure from
       Hydrogen Combustion During a Severe Accident
This issue primarily concerns the fact that the hydrogen igniters in ice condenser and BWR
Mark III containment plants are not supplied with emergency power and would not function
during SBOs.  There is a potential, then, that such a containment might fail due to uncontrolled
hydrogen combustion during an accident involving an SBO.  At this time, all of the operating
Generic Issues
20-68
plants that have hydrogen igniters (and are susceptible to this weakness) have either ice
condenser or Mark III containments.  Although the AP1000 does not have such a containment,
it does have hydrogen igniters, and so the staff considered the applicability of Issue 189 to
AP1000.
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant identified Issue 189 as either having a priority of “low,
drop” or as not having been prioritized.  The staff agrees with this assessment for the following
reasons:

As a result of the passive design, the fraction of core-damage frequency (CDF) that
involves SBO is less than 1 percent.  Thus, the igniters are highly reliable.

Despite the low contribution to CDF from SBO, the AP1000 design has the capability to
power the igniters from non-safety-grade DGs or station batteries in the event of a SBO.
Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue-189 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue 191:  Assessment of Debris Accumulation on PWR Sump Performance
Like Issue A-43 (see earlier description), Issue 191 concerns the potential for debris blockage
to interfere with the capability of the recirculation mode of the ECCS to provide long-term
reactor core cooling at PWRs.  Although Issue A-43 was considered resolved in 1985, later
operational events at BWRs and confirmatory testing demonstrated that its resolution was not
based on a complete understanding of debris generation, transport, and head loss.  Thus,
during the resolution of the clogging issue for BWRs, Issue 191 was opened to reexamine the
effect of debris blockage on PWR sump performance in a more accurate manner.
At the present time, the NRC is in the process of resolving Issue 191 for the current generation
of PWRs, and some part of this research and analysis is incomplete.  Section 6.2.1.8 of this
report provides the staff’s evaluation of the AP1000 suction screens in accordance with the
current state of knowledge regarding Issue 191.  
Therefore, Issue 191 is resolved for the AP1000.
20.4  Three Mile Island Action Items
Issue I.A.1.4:  Long-Term Upgrading
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.A.1.4 addresses changes to 10 CFR 50.54, “Conditions
of Licenses,” concerning shift staffing and working hours of licensed operators.  The final rule
that amended 10 CFR 50.54 was approved on April 28, 1983.  This issue was resolved and
new requirements were established.  DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant
concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design
because it is not a DC issue, but is the responsibility of the COL applicant.
The staff, however, considers this issue not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is an
operational issue outside the scope of AP1000 DC.  Section 13.1 of this report discusses the
organizational structure of the site operator.  The COL applicant will be responsible for
addressing this issue as part of the licensing process.  This is COL Action Item 20.4-1.
Generic Issues
20-69
Therefore, Issue I.A.1.4 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.A.2.6(1):  Revise Regulatory Guide 1.8
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Item I.A.2.6(1) addresses the revision of RG 1.8, “Qualification
and Training of Personnel for Nuclear Power Plants,” following the publication of NUREG-0737. 
The revisions to the RG address an acceptable means to meet new requirements for long-term
upgrading of training and qualifications for operational personnel.  The revisions to RG 1.8 were
approved by the Commission and published in May 1987 (see 52 FR 16007).  This issue is
resolved by the new requirements established.
The staff considers this issue not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is an operational
issue outside the scope of the DC.  Section 13.1 of this report discusses the organizational
structure of the site operator.  The COL applicant will be responsible for addressing this
issue as part of the licensing process.  This is COL Action Item 20.4-2.
Therefore, Issue I.A.2.6(1) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.A.4.1(2):  Interim Changes in Training Simulators
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.A.4.1(2) addresses the specific training simulator
weaknesses identified in the short-term study of Issue I.A.4.1(1) in NUREG/CR-1482, “Nuclear
Power Plant Simulators:  Their Use in Operator Training and Requalification,” dated
August 1980.  This issue was resolved with the revision of RG 1.149, “Nuclear Power Plant
Simulators for Use in Operator Training,” in April 1981, which established new acceptance
requirements.
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is not a DC issue, but is the
responsibility of the COL applicant.  The staff also considers this issue not relevant to the
AP1000 design because it is an operational issue outside the scope of the DC.  Section 13.2 of
this report discusses training materials.  The COL applicant will be responsible for addressing
this issue as part of the COL process.  This issue is a part of COL Action Item 20.4-2. 
Therefore, Issue 1.A.4.a(2) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.A.4.2:  Long-Term Training Simulator Upgrade 
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.A.4.2 addresses the capabilities of training simulators. 
This issue was resolved by Revision 1 of RG 1.149, “Nuclear Power Plant Simulation Facilities
for Use in Operator License Examinations,” 10 CFR 55.45(b) on approved or certified
simulation facility in licensed operator operating tests, and NUREG-1258, “Evaluation
Procedure for Simulation Facilities Certified Under 10 CFR 55,” dated December 1987.  New
requirements were established.  DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant
concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design
because it is not a DC issue, but is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is part of COL
Action Item 20.4-2.  As indicated in Section 18.3 of this report, the applicant, in WCAP-14645,
has satisfactorily addressed this item.  Therefore, Issue I.A.4.2 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Generic Issues
20-70
Issue I.C.1: Short-Term Accident Analysis and Procedures Revision
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.C.1 addresses the preparation of emergency operating
procedures (EOPs).  The information in the EOPs should provide assurance that operator and
staff actions are technically correct and the procedures are easily understood for normal,
transient, and accident conditions.  The EOPs must be function-oriented procedures to mitigate
the consequences of the broad range of events, and subsequent multiple failure or operator
errors, without the need to diagnose specific events.  The overall content, wording, and format
of procedures that affect plant operation, administration, maintenance, testing and surveillance
must comply with the guidance provided in NUREG-0737, as well as Supplement 1 to this same
report.
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue is not an AP1000 DC issue, but is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  The
staff has identified in COL Action Item 18.9.4-1 that the COL applicant should develop plant-
specific EOPs using the guidance provided by the ERGs. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 18.9 states that WCAP-14690, “Designer’s Input to Procedure
Development for the AP600,” provides the COL applicant information on the development and
design of the AP600 ERGs and EOPs.
There are fundamental differences between the low pressure (LP) reference plant and the
AP1000 design in terms of the safety system design, operation, and philosophy of emergency
mitigation and recovery.  Unlike the LP reference plant in which the safety systems are active
systems, the safety systems in the AP1000 are passive systems.  Active systems are
non-safety-related systems providing defense-in-depth functions.  Even though the passive
safety systems perform functions similar to those performed by the active safety systems in the
LP reference plants, the AP1000 mitigation sequences, including the actuation of the active
defense-in-depth systems and passive safety systems and the plant conditions at which these
systems will be actuated and will remain operating, differ from the LP reference plants.  For the
AP1000, the active systems, though not actuated by safeguard signals, are manually actuated
and relied upon as the first line of defense to avoid unnecessary actuation of passive safety
systems.
The plant responses, including possible ASIs between the active and passive systems, may
also differ significantly from the LP reference plants.  Certain issues in which operator actions
play key roles in the accident scenarios require the AP1000-specific ERGs as a basis for
resolution.  For example, in an SGTR event, the operator’s actions to isolate the faulted SG,
and other mitigation and recovery actions to minimize the possibility of radioactive releases
through the main steam safety valves, will be important for the resolution of the resulting
containment bypass.  Additionally, the ERGs should include guidance for (1) low-power and
shutdown operations, (2) times when many systems will be out for maintenance and the plant is
in a configuration different from normal operation, and (3) severe accident management. 
To satisfy these requirements, the staff considered the need for the ERGs and supporting
analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of operator actions in response to transients and
accidents.  As indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant, in WCAP-14645, has
satisfactorily demonstrated the effectiveness of operator actions in response to transients

and accidents.  Therefore, Issue I.C.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design, based on COL Action
Item 18.9.4-1.
Issue I.C.5:  Procedures for Feedback of Operating Experience to Plant Staff
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.C.5 addresses the quality of procedures for feedback of
experience at operating plants.  This issue was clarified in NUREG-0737, which issued
additional requirements.  
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (3)(i), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design engineers
are continually involved in reviewing industry experiences from sources such as NRC BLs,
licensee event reports (LERs), NRC request for information letters to licensees, Federal
Register information, and NRC GLs.  The applicant further stated that it had incorporated
lessons-learned experience into the AP1000 design through its participation in the development
of Volume III of the ALWR URD and in the activities of the ALWR Utility Steering Committee.
The applicant addressed the responsibility of the designer of the plant; however, the COL
applicant will also be responsible for site-specific information at the COL and operational
phases.  Development of detailed procedures is outside the scope of the AP1000 DC and is the
responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is part of COL Action Item 20.4-2.  Therefore,
Issue I.C.5 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.C.9:  Long-Term Program Plan for Upgrading of Procedures
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.C.9 addresses the upgrading of procedures at operating
plants.  With the exception of EOPs, this issue was clarified in Supplement 1 of NUREG-0737
and resolved with Revision 1 of SRP, Section 13.5.2.  This issue was resolved with no new
requirements.
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design because it was resolved with no new
requirements.
However, the applicant should identify the responsibility of the COL applicant in procedure
development.  It should address the methods and criteria for the development, verification and
validation, implementation, maintenance, and revision of procedures.
This is a COL action item in DCD Tier 2 and as discussed in Section 18.3, of this report, the
applicant has satisfactorily addressed this item in WCAP-14645.  Issue I.C.9 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue I.D.1:  Control Room Design Reviews
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.D.1 addresses licensee performance of a detailed review
of the control room using human factors engineering (HFE) techniques and guidelines to
identify and correct design deficiencies.  This issue was clarified in NUREG-0737 and
NUREG-0700, “Guidelines for Control Room Design Reviews,” dated September 1981, in which
additional requirements were issued.  This issue is considered resolved.
Generic Issues
20-72
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(iii), the applicant stated that the AP1000 MCR was
designed by a multidisciplined, man-machine interface design team using state-of-the-art
human factors principles.  The team used a control room design process predicated on the
functional decomposition of the plant, integrating the capabilities of both man and machine. 
DCD Tier 2, Chapter 18, discusses the MCR design process and DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.1,
provides information on the conformance of the design with applicable RGs.
As indicated in DCD Tier 2 and discussed in Section 18.3 of this report, the applicant
satisfactorily addressed this item in WCAP-14645.  Therefore, Issue I.D.1 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue I.D.2:  Plant Safety Parameter Display Console
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.D.2 addresses improving the presentation of the
information provided to control room operators.  Supplement 1 to NUREG-0737 includes the
requirements for this issue.  This issue raised the need for an SPDS that clearly displays a
minimum set of parameters defining the safety status of the plant.  Paragraph (2)(iv) of 10 CFR
50.34(f) requires a plant SPDS console to provide such a display to operators, and to be
capable of displaying a full range of important plant parameters and data trends on demand,
thus indicating when process limits are being approached or exceeded.  
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(iv), the applicant stated that the purpose of the plant
SPDS is to display the important plant variables in the MCR to assist the operator in rapidly and
reliably determining the safety status of the plant.  
DCD Tier 2, Chapter 18 discusses the SPDS design.  The SPDS requirements are specified
during the MCR design process, as discussed in Issue I.D.1, and are met by the MCR design,
specifically as part of the alarms, displays, and controls.  The requirements are met by grouping
the alarms by plant process or purpose, as directly related to the critical safety functions.
The process data presented on the graphic displays are similarly grouped, facilitating an easy
transition for the operators.  The SPDS requirement for presenting plant data in an analog
fashion before reactor trip is met by the design of the graphic cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. 
Displays are available at the operator workstations, the supervisor workstation, the remote
shutdown workstation, and the technical support center (TSC).
As indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645.  Issue I.D.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.D.3:  Safety System Status Monitoring
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.D.3 addresses the need for those licensees and
applicants who have not committed to RG 1.47, “Bypassed and Inoperable Status Indication for
Nuclear Power Plant Safety Systems,” to install a bypass and inoperable status indication
system to give operators timely information on the status of the safety systems.  Resolution of
this issue requires adoption of the guidelines in RG 1.47.
In DCD Tier 2, 1.9.3, Item (2)(v), the applicant stated that the AP1000 MCR meets the NRC
RG 1.47 recommendations, including the automatic indication of bypassed and inoperable
Generic Issues
20-73
status of plant safety systems.  This is described in DCD Tier 2, Chapters 7 and 18, and
Appendix 1A.  Plant safety parameters, protection system status, and plant component status
signals are processed by the protection and safety monitoring system and made available to
the entire I&C system via the redundant monitor bus.
Class 1E signals are provided to the qualified data processor, which is part of the protection
and safety monitoring system, for accident monitoring displays.  The display of these data is
incorporated in the process data displays on the graphic CRTs located in the AP1000 MCR.
The AP1000 design incorporates this information into the alarm system, the operator’s
workstation, and the wall panel information system in the MCR.  High-level plant status during
any plant state is continuously available on the wall panel information system.  At the operator’s
workstation, physical and functional displays show how a component’s availability or
unavailability impacts the alignment and availability of the system.  This is indicated on the
display that includes the bypassed or deliberately induced inoperability of the protection system,
and the systems actuated or controlled by that protection system.  Alarms on the operator’s
workstation and the wall panel information system indicate abnormal conditions.  Improper
safety system alignments, safety-related component unavailability, and bypassed protective
functions are considered in the alarm logic.  The alarm system continuously monitors this
information.
Based on the above information, the staff concludes that the AP1000 design meets the
guidelines of RG 1.47 and, therefore, meets the requirements of Issue I.D.3 with respect to the
I&C design for safety system status monitoring.  Issue I.D.3 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.D.5(2):  Plant Status and Postaccident Monitoring
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.D.5(2) addresses the need to improve the operators’
ability to prevent, diagnose, and properly respond to accidents.  This issue was originally raised
in 1980, in NUREG-0660, “NRC Action Plan Developed as a Result of the TMI-2 Accident,”
dated May 1980, and led to new NRC requirements.  Guidance for addressing the issue is in
RG 1.47, which describes an acceptable method for implementing the requirements of
IEEE 279-1971, “Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” and
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B (Criterion XIV) with respect to the bypass or inoperable status of
safety systems, and RG 1.97, which defines an acceptable method for implementing NRC
requirements to provide instrumentation and to monitor plant variables and systems during and
following an accident.
The acceptance criteria for the resolution of this issue include the following:

For engineered safety feature (ESF) status monitoring, RG 1.47 recommends automatic
bypassed or inoperable status indication at the system level for plant protection
systems, safety systems actuated or controlled by protection systems, and their auxiliary
and supporting systems.  These features should indicate in the MCR and should have
manual input capability.

For postaccident monitoring instrumentation, RG 1.97, Revision 2, gives criteria for
design and qualification of the instrumentation.  Three categories (designated 1, 2, and
3) provide a graded approach to requirements on the basis of the importance to safety
Generic Issues
20-74
of the variable being monitored.  Criteria exist for equipment qualification, redundancy,
power sources, channel availability, quality assurance (QA), display and recording
range, equipment identification, interfaces, servicing, testing and calibration, human
factors, and direct measurement.  The actual variables to be monitored are tabulated by
type, and the instrumentation design and qualification requirement (Category 1, 2, or 3)
are identified for each variable.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, Item I.D.5(2), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design
conforms to and meets the intent of RG 1.97, which provides acceptable guidance for
postaccident monitoring of nuclear reactor safety parameters, including plant process
parameters important to safety, and the monitoring of effluent paths and plant environs for
radioactivity.  For the AP1000 design, an analysis was conducted to identify the appropriate
plant variables, and to establish the appropriate design-basis and qualification criteria for
instrumentation used by an operator for monitoring conditions in the RCS, secondary heat
removal system, the containment, and the systems used for attaining a safe-shutdown
condition.  DCD Tier 2, Section 7.5, further discusses this analysis.
The instrumentation is used by the operator to monitor and maintain the safety of the plant
during operating conditions, including anticipated operational occurrences, and accident and
post-accident conditions.  A set of plant parameters identified to satisfy RG 1.97 are processed
and displayed by the qualified data processing system (QDPS) discussed in DCD Tier 2,
Section 18.8.  The verification and validation (V&V) of the QDPS complies with the V&V
process described in DCD Tier 2, Section 18.11. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 7.5, the applicant compared the AP1000 design against the criteria in
RG 1.97, Revision 3, and addressed accident monitoring instrumentation.  The applicant
concluded that the AP1000 design complies with RG 1.97, Revision 3.
Issue I.D.5(2) was resolved with the issuance of RG 1.97, Revision 2.  On the basis of the
information provided by the applicant and the fact that the AP1000 design is in compliance with
RG 1.97, Revision 3, the staff concludes that this issue has been addressed.  Therefore,
Issue I.D.5(2) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.D.5(3):  Online Reactor Surveillance Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue I.D.5(3) addresses the benefit to plant safety and
operations of continuous, online automated surveillance systems.  Systems that automatically
monitor reactor performance can benefit plant operations and safety by providing continuous
diagnostic information to the control room operators, thus allowing them to predict and identify
anomalous plant behavior.
Various methods of on-line reactor surveillance have been used, including neutron noise
monitoring in BWRs to detect vibrations in internal components and pressure noise surveillance
at TMI-2 to monitor primary loop degasification.  Online surveillance data have been used to
assess loose thermal shields.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, the applicant stated that the AP1000 RCPB is monitored for
leaks from the reactor coolant and associated system by a variety of components located in
multiple systems, and that the leak detection system is designed according to the requirements
Generic Issues
20-75
of GDC 30, “Quality of Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary.”  The applicant also stated that a
digital metal impact monitoring system (DMIMS) monitors the RCS for the presence of loose
metallic parts, and that this system conforms with the guidance provided in RG 1.133,
Revision 1.
The acceptance criteria for leak monitoring are in RG 1.45, “Reactor Coolant Pressure
Boundary Leakage Detection Systems,” which documents acceptable methods for channel
separation, leakage detection, detection sensitivity and response time, signal calibration, and
seismic qualification of RCPB leakage detection systems.  It defines the regulatory position for
an acceptable design of these systems.
The acceptance criteria for loose-parts monitoring are in RG 1.133, “Loose-Part Detection
Program for the Primary System of Light-Water-Cooled Reactors.”  This RG offers guidelines
on such system characteristics as sensitivity, channel separation, data acquisition, and seismic
and environmental conditions for operability.  It also identifies alert levels, data acquisition
modes, safety analysis reports, and TS pertaining to a loose-parts monitoring system.
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.2.5, provides a detailed discussion of the detection of leakage through
the RCPB.  Section 5.2.5 of this report describes the staff’s evaluation of the AP1000 RCBP
leakage detection.  DCD Tier 2, Section 4.4.6.4, describes the AP1000 DMIMS.  Section 4.4.4.2
of this report discusses the staff’s evaluation of the AP1000 DMIMS.
Based on its evaluations discussed in Sections 5.2.5 and 4.4.4.2 of this report, the staff
concludes that Issue I.D.5(3) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.F.1:  Expanded Quality Assurance List
As required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(ii), an applicant for DC must demonstrate compliance with any
technically relevant portions of the TMI requirements set forth in 10 CFR 50.34(f).  As required
by 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(ii), an application must provide sufficient information to “ensure that the
QA list required by Criterion II, App B, 10 CFR part 50 includes all structures, systems, and
components important to safety (I.F.1).”  This requirement was intended to expand the QA list
to ensure that non-safety-related SSCs that were important to safety were subject to
appropriate QA controls. 
The NRC staff reviewed the QA controls described in the AP1000 DC application that are
applicable to the non-safety-related SSCs to verify that adequate controls were specified to
ensure the reliability and availability of risk-significant, non-safety-related SSCs.  The staff
determined that quality programs, such as the RAP and the RTNSS, are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that non-safety-related SSCs that are important to safety will perform
satisfactorily in service.  Section 17.4 of this report discusses the staff evaluation of the AP1000
RAP; Section 17.3 and Chapter 22 of this report discuss the staff’s evaluation of the RTNSS
program.
Based on the existence of alternate quality programs that provide reasonable assurance that
non-safety-related SSCs important to safety will perform satisfactorily in service, the staff
concludes that the requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(ii) are not technically relevant to the
AP1000 DC.  Therefore, the requirement to include all SSCs important to safety in the QA list is
not applicable to the AP1000 DC.

Issue I.F.2:  Develop More Detailed Quality Assurance Criteria
As required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(ii), an applicant for DC must demonstrate compliance with any
technically relevant portions of the TMI requirements set forth in 10 CFR 50.34(f).  As stated in
10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii), an application must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that
the following requirements have been met: 
Establish a quality assurance (QA) program based on consideration of:
(A) ensuring independence of the organization performing checking functions
from the organization responsible for performing the functions; (B) performing
quality assurance/quality control functions at construction sites to the maximum
feasible extent; (C) including QA personnel in the documented review of and
concurrence in quality related procedures associated with the design,
construction and installation; (D) establishing criteria for determining QA
programmatic requirements; (E) establishing qualification requirements for QA
and QC personnel; (F) sizing the QA staff commensurate with its duties and
responsibilities; (G) establishing procedures for maintenance of “as built”
documentation; and (H) providing a QA role in design and analysis activities.
The requirements in 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii) were intended to improve the QA program to
provide greater assurance that plant design, construction, and operational activities were
conducted in a manner commensurate with their importance to safety.  The NRC staff reviewed
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii) to determine which requirements were technically
relevant to a DC applicant.  The NRC staff determined that the requirements contained in
10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii)(B) were associated with QA activities during plant construction and,
therefore, were not technically relevant to a DC applicant.  Similarly, the requirements of
10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii)(G) were associated with control of “as-built” documentation and,
therefore, were not technically relevant to DC.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, the applicant
indicated that the AP1000 QA plan described in DCD Tier 2, Section 17, meets the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii). 
As required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(iv), an application for DC must contain proposed technical
resolutions of those medium- and high-priority GSIs identified in the version of NUREG-0933,
current on the date 6 months prior to the application and which are technically relevant to the
design.  As discussed in NUREG-0933, the NRC staff resolved four issues associated with Item
I.F.2 by establishing new requirements in SRP Chapter 17.  These issues include the following:
•
Item I.F.2(2)—Include QA personnel in review and approval of plant procedures
•
Item I.F.2(3)—include QA personnel in all design, construction, installation, testing, and
operation activities 
•
Item I.F.2(6)—increase the size of the QA staff
•
Item I.F.2(9)—clarify organizational reporting levels for the QA organization
The remainder of the issues associated with Item I.F.2 were classified as low-priority issues
and, therefore, are not applicable to a DC application.  The staff concluded that because Items
I.F.2(2), (3), (6), and (9) were resolved by a revision to SRP Chapter 17, a review of the QA
Generic Issues
20-77
program conducted in accordance with SRP Section 17.3 would verify compliance with these
requirements.  As discussed in Section 17.3 of this report, the staff determined that the
applicant maintained an NRC reviewed and approved QA program that complied with the
requirements for 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B.  In addition, the NRC staff planned to conduct an
inspection of the implementation of the quality plan to verify that design activities conducted for
the AP1000 project comply with the applicant’s QA program and the requirements of 10 CFR
Part 50.  The NRC staff planned to review the implementation of requirements related to the
technically relevant portions of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(3)(iii) during this inspection.  This issue was
identified as Open Item 17.3.2-2.  As discussed in Section 17.3.2 of this report, the inspection
teams determined that Westinghouse had adequately implemented their QA program. 
Therefore, Open Item 17.3.2-2 was resolved.  Therefore, Issue I.F.2 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue I.G.1:  Training Requirements
This TMI action plan item calls for a new OL to conduct a set of low-power tests to achieve the
objectives of Task I.G, “Pre-operational and Low Power Testing.”  The objectives of Task I.G
are to: (1) increase the capability of shift crews to operate facilities in a safe and competent
manner by assuring that the training for plant changes and off-normal events was conducted,
and (2) review the comprehensiveness of test programs.  Near-term OL facilities were required
to develop and implement intensified training exercises during the low-power testing programs. 
In Revision 3 to DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, “AP1000 Resolution of Unresolved Safety Issues
and Generic Safety Issues,” the applicant addressed this item.  The applicant addresses the
overall preoperational and start-up testing program in Chapter 14, “Initial Test Program.”  With
regard to initial test program training, the applicant indicated, for example, that the results of
performing natural circulation testing will be used as input into operator training.  The applicant
further stated that data obtained from the first-plant-only natural circulation tests using SGs and
PRHR are provided for operator training on the simulator at the earliest opportunity, and
operator training for subsequent plants is also obtained while performing hot functional PRHR
natural circulation testing.
The applicant stated that the COL applicant is responsible for developing an operator training
program.  In addition, Sections 14.2.5, “Utilization of Reactor Operating and Testing
Experiences in the Development of the Test Program,” and 14.2.6, “Trial Use of Plant
Operating and Emergency Procedures,” of this report state that the NRC staff will defer review
of the trial use of plant operating, emergency, and testing procedures to the COL phase.  The
NRC staff agrees that operator training program development and implementation are the
responsibilities of the COL applicant.  Therefore, Issue I.G.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue I.G.2:  Scope of Test Program
As required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(iv), an application for DC must contain proposed technical
resolutions of those medium- and high-priority GSIs identified in the version of NUREG-0933,
“A Prioritization of Generic Safety Issues,” current on the date 6 months prior to the application
and which are technically relevant to the design.  As discussed in NUREG-0933, the NRC staff
resolved Item I.G.2, “Scope of Test Program,” by establishing new requirements in SRP
Chapter 14.
Generic Issues
20-78
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, the applicant stated that the program plan for preoperational
and start-up testing of the AP1000 design is in DCD Tier 2, Section 14.2, “Specific Information
to be Included in Standard Safety Analysis Reports,” which addressed SRP Section 14. 
The NRC staff has concluded that the initial test program conducted in accordance with SRP
Section 14.2 is adequate.  Section 14.2 of this report documents the staff’s evaluation of the
test program and the test program scope.  Therefore, Issue I.G.2 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue II.B.1:  Reactor Coolant System Vents
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.B.1 addresses the requirements in 10 CFR Part 50 and
NUREG-0737 to install reactor vessel and RCS high-point vents.  These vents are designed to
release noncondensable gases from the RCS to avoid loss of core cooling during natural
circulation.  The design of these vents must conform to the following GDC requirements of
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, and the applicable Codes and standards for the RCS pressure
boundary:

the system must be operable from the control room (GDC 19)

the system must be testable (GDC 36) 

the system must be capable of functioning following a LOOP (GDC 17) 

the system must be able to withstand an operating-basis earthquake (RG 1.29, “Seismic
Design Classification,” Revision 3, September 1978)
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(vi), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design includes
the capability for remotely venting the high points of the RCS using the safety-related ADS
valves and the safety-related reactor vessel head vent (RVHV) system.  Both discharge to the
IRWST.  The ADS provides redundant groups of MOVs connected to the top of the pressurizer
and squib valves connected to the top of each RCS hot leg.  However, only the pressurizer
MOVs (i.e., the first-stage ADS valves) are used for remote manual venting because they are
the only ADS valves capable of being throttled.  The RVHV system removes steam and
noncondensable gases directly from the reactor vessel head (RVH).
The applicant further stated that during normal and moderate frequency events,
noncondensable gases from the RCS accumulate in the pressurizer steam space with very
little accumulation in the RVH because of the continuous recirculation of bypass spray flow
through the pressurizer when the RCPs are operating.  This bypass flow causes boiling in the
pressurizer, making the pressurizer steam space the lowest static pressure region in the RCS. 
This causes off-gassing of the RCS to occur in the pressurizer.  This gas accumulation can be
removed by remote manual operation of the first-stage ADS valves.
During LOCAs, the ADS automatically depressurizes the RCS so that the PXS may operate
and effectively deliver cooling flow to the core.  This would not happen until the RCS pressure
was brought down to the operating level of the PXS.
The applicant also stated that it is possible that continued depressurization of the RCS by the
ADS could create a gas-steam volume (bubble) in the upper region (head) of the reactor
vessel.  With only the ADS in operation, this volume can expand, filling the head of the vessel
until it reaches the inside of the hot leg and is vented through the hot leg and the surge line and
Generic Issues
20-79
out of the RCS.  At the hot leg, this volume either vents into the pressurizer through the surge
line and enters the ADS, or enters the ADS through the hot leg.  This will depend on which ADS
valves are open.  This venting provides an open injection and steam venting path through the
reactor vessel, and maintains required core flow without the reactor vessel and pressurizer
needing to be refilled.
The staff reviewed the high-point vents for the AP1000 design.  The design relies on the
safety-related ADS valves and the safety-related RVHV system to provide the capability of
high-point venting of noncondensable gases from the RCS.  DCD Tier 2, Sections 5.4.12, 5.4.6,
and 6.3, provide descriptions of the RVHV system and the ADS valves.  These systems are
operated from the MCR, and associated valve position indications and alarms are provided. 
Their vent paths discharge to the IRWST.  
The RVHV system is located entirely inside containment.  Because the system isolation valves
do not serve a containment isolation function, containment integrity will not be compromised as
a result of a loss of power to the valves.  This is a design improvement relative to current
operating and standard design plants, where the RVHV system isolation valves also provide
containment isolation.
The system has the capability to remove noncondensable gases or steam from the RCS using
remote manual operation of the redundant vent paths.  It is designed to vent a volume of
hydrogen equal to approximately 40 percent of the RCS volume at system pressure and
temperature in 1 hour.  The first-stage ADS valves are attached to the pressurizer and they
provide the capability to vent noncondensable gases from the pressurizer steam space
following an accident. 
Sections 5.4.12 and 6.3 of this report provide the staff’s evaluation of the RVHV system and the
ADS design, respectively.  The staff concludes that the AP1000 design complies with the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(vi); therefore, Issue II.B.1 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue II.B.2:  Plant Shielding To Provide Access to Vital Areas and Protect Safety Equipment
for Postaccident Operation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.B.2 addresses licensee performance of a radiation and
shielding design review of the spaces around systems that may, as a result of an accident,
contain highly radioactive materials.  The review would locate vital areas and equipment, such
as the MCR, radwaste control stations, emergency power supplies, motor control centers, and
instrument areas, where occupancy may be unduly limited or safety equipment may be unduly
degraded by the radiation fields during postaccident operations of these systems.  This
issue was resolved and the requirements were provided in 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(vii).
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(vii), the applicant stated that a plant shielding analysis
was performed of the AP1000 general plant arrangement.  This included a review of the
primary shielding surrounding the reactor; the secondary shielding that encloses the reactor
coolant loops; the shielding for refueling operations, including the refueling canal walls and
refueling water; the auxiliary shielding such as equipment compartments, valve galleries, piping
tunnels, the CVS, and other equipment modules; and accident shielding, including the shielding
Generic Issues
20-80
provided by buildings and the shielding to minimize sky shine.  The applicant further stated that
improvements were incorporated into the AP1000 shielding design as they were identified.
DCD Tier 2, Section 12.2, addresses postaccident radiation sources used in the shield design
and assessment of postaccident access to vital areas.  The postaccident source term used for
the AP1000 is predicated on the core release model from NUREG-1465, “Accident Source
Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants,” which supersedes the TID-14844 source term
assumptions reflected in RG 1.4, “Assumptions Used for Evaluating the Potential Radiological
Consequences of a Loss-of-Coolant Accident for Pressurized-Water Reactors.”  DCD Tier 2,
Section 12.2, contains tables that list the post-LOCA instantaneous and integrated source
strengths as a function of time.  DCD Tier 2, Section 12.3, addresses vital areas for
postaccident access and includes radiation zone maps that show projected dose rates in these
areas and access routes for the various postaccident actions requiring access to vital areas.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 12.4.1.8, the applicant provided a listing of the six vital plant areas that
will require postaccident accessibility.  For each of these areas, the applicant performed an
analysis to determine the dose to the individuals performing these postaccident actions.  These
analyses, which utilized the appropriate time-dependent postaccident dose rates and the
required postaccident access times, confirmed that personnel radiation doses for individuals
accessing these areas following an accident will not exceed the guidelines of GDC 19
(5E-02 sieverts (5 rem) whole body or its equivalent to any part of the body) during the course
of the accident.
The staff concludes that, based on the information presented above, Issue II.B.2 is resolved for
the AP1000 design.
Issue II.B.3:  Postaccident Sampling
The requirements for the postaccident sampling system (PASS) can be found in 10 CFR
50.34(f)(2)(viii).  The reactor coolant and containment atmosphere sampling-line systems
should permit personnel to take a sample under accident conditions promptly and safely.  The
radiological spectrum analysis facilities should be capable of quantifying certain radionuclides
that are indicators of the degree of core damage promptly.  In addition to the radiological
analyses, certain chemical analyses are necessary for monitoring reactor conditions. 
The NRC published a model safety evaluation report on eliminating the PASS requirements
from the TS for operating plants (see 65 FR 65018, dated October 31, 2000).
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.B.3 addresses upgrading postaccident sampling at
plants, the requirements for which can be found in 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(viii).  Issue II.B.3
specifically addresses a licensee’s radiological and chemical sampling and analysis capability
under transient or accident conditions, including related radiation exposures.  The purpose of
the PASS is to (1) provide sources of information for use by decisionmakers in developing
protective action recommendations, and (2) assess core damage.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(viii), the applicant stated that the AP1000 sampling
design-basis is consistent with the approach in the model safety evaluation and not the previous
guidance of NUREG-0737 and RG 1.97.  This approach includes contingency plans to obtain
and analyze highly radioactive postaccident samples from the RCS, the containment sump, and
Generic Issues
20-81
the containment atmosphere.  The applicant stated in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, that the
AP1000 design is consistent with this guidance.  Therefore, the staff finds the applicant’s
elimination of the PASS for the AP1000 design to be acceptable.
As discussed in Section 13.3.3.4 of this report, the PASS requirements of Issue II.B.3 have
been eliminated by the model safety evaluation.  The staff concludes that, based on the
evaluation in Sections 9.3.3 and 13.3 of this report, Issue II.B.3 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue II.B.8:  Rulemaking Proceedings on Degraded Core Accidents
Item II.B.8 discusses the need to establish policy, goals, and requirements to address accidents
resulting in core damage greater than the existing design basis.  The Commission expects that
new designs will achieve a higher standard of severe accident safety performance than
previous designs.  In an effort to provide this additional level of safety in the design of advanced
nuclear power plants, the NRC developed guidance and goals for designers to strive for in
accommodating events that are beyond what was previously known as the design-basis of the
plant.
For advanced passive nuclear power plants, like the AP1000, the staff concludes that vendors
should address severe accidents during the design stage to take full advantage of the insights
gained from probabilistic safety assessments, operating experience, severe accident research,
and accident analysis by designing features to reduce the likelihood that severe accidents will
occur and, in the unlikely occurrence of a severe accident, to mitigate the consequences of
such an accident.  Incorporating insights and design features during the design phase is much
more cost effective than modifying existing plants.
The NRC issued guidance for addressing severe accidents in the following documents:


Existing Plants,” issued August 8, 1985

Generic Issues
20-82
The NRC policy statements provide guidance as to the appropriate course for addressing
severe accidents, 10 CFR Part 52 contains general requirements for addressing severe
accidents, and the SRMs relating to SECY-90-016 and SECY-93-087 offer Commission-
approved positions for implementing features in new designs for preventing severe accidents
and mitigating their effects.
SECY-93-087 and 10 CFR Part 52 serve as the basis for resolving severe accident issues
associated with the AP1000.  Title 10, Part 52, of the Code of Federal Regulations requires
(1) compliance with the TMI requirements in 10 CFR 50.34(f), (2) resolution of USIs and GSIs,
and (3) completion of a design-specific PRA.  The staff evaluates these criteria in
Sections 20.3, 20.1 and 20.2, and 19.1 of this report, respectively.
The Commission-approved positions on the issues discussed in SECY-93-087 form the basis of
the staff’s deterministic evaluation of severe accident performance for the AP1000 design.  The
staff evaluates the AP1000 design relative to these criteria in Section 19.2 of this report. 
Issue II.B.8 is resolved for the AP1000 design on the basis of the staff’s evaluation of the
probabilistic and deterministic analyses in the AP1000 PRA, as documented in Chapter 19 of
this report.
Issue II.D.1:  Testing Requirements
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.D.1 addresses the requirements in NUREG-0737 for
qualification testing of RCS safety, relief, and block valves under expected operating conditions
for design-basis transients and accidents, including ATWS.  This issue was resolved by
requiring licensees to conduct testing to qualify reactor coolant relief valves, safety valves,
block valves, and associated discharge piping.
The EPRI conducted a safety and relief valve test program for a group of PWR licensees to
respond to the staff recommendations in NUREG-0578, “TMI-2 Lessons Learned Task Force
Status Report and Short-Term Recommendations,” July 1979, as clarified in NUREG-0737. 
The purpose of the program was to develop sufficient documentation and test data so that the
participating licensees could demonstrate compliance with the Issue II.D.1 requirements.  The
results were documented in EPRI-NP-2770-LD, “EPRI PWR Safety Valve Test Report,” issued
in December 1982.  The staff used the test results documented in EPRI-NP-2770-LD and
summarized in EPRI-NP-2628-SR, “EPRI PWR Safety and Relief Valve Test Report,” issued in
December 1982, as a part of its acceptance criteria in its evaluations of the resolution of
Issue II.D.1 for all current operating plants. 
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(x), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not
include PORVs and their associated block valves on the RCS.  The safety valve and discharge
piping used will either be of a design similar as those valves tested and documented in EPRI
Report NP-2770-LD, or will be tested in accordance with the guidelines of Issue II.D.1 in
NUREG-0737.  The applicant’s commitment in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, is consistent with the
acceptance criteria used by the staff in its evaluations of Issue II.D.1 for operating plants, and is
acceptable for the AP1000 design.  Therefore, Issue II.D.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-83
Issue II.D.3: Relief and Safety Valve Position Indication
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.D.3 addresses the requirements in NUREG-0737 for
positive indication in the MCR of RCS relief or safety valve position.  The acceptance criterion
for the resolution of this issue is for the plant design to include safety and relief valve indication
derived from a reliable valve-position detection device or a reliable indication of flow in the
discharge pipe, in accordance with the requirements in NUREG-0737.
 
This indication shall have the following design features:

Unambiguous safety and relief valve indication shall be provided to the control room
operator.

Valve position should be indicated within the MCR and should be alarmed.

Valve position indication may be either safety or control grade; if it is control grade, it
must be powered from a reliable (e.g., battery backed) instrument bus (see RG 1.97).

Valve position indication should be seismically qualified consistent with the component
or system to which it is attached.

Valve position indication shall be qualified for the appropriate operating environment
which includes the expected normal containment environment and an operating basis
earthquake (OBE).

Valve position indication shall be human-factors engineered.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xi), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not
include PORVs and their associated block valves, and the direct indication of the position of the
relief and safety valves in the AP1000 design is provided in the MCR.
This issue requires that reactor coolant relief and safety valves be provided with positive
indication in the control room.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.9, states that the AP1000 design
complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xi) because positive position indication is
provided for the pressurizer safety valves and the RNS system relief valves.  These valves are
spring-loaded, self-actuated by direct fluid pressure, and have back pressure compensation
features.  These valves are designed to reclose and prevent further flow of fluid after normal
conditions have been restored.  The pressurizer safety valves are of the totally enclosed, pop-
type.  The RNS relief valve is designed for water relief.
Therefore, the staff considers that the AP1000 design satisfies the requirements of Item II.D.3,
and this issue is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.1.1:  Auxiliary Feedwater System Evaluation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.1.1 addresses improving the reliability of the AFWS or
the EFWS.  The issue addresses the following requirements in NUREG-0737:


evaluated EFW flow rate design basis and criteria
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Items (1)(ii) and (2)(xii), the applicant stated that the AP1000
design does not utilize an AFWS.  A non-safety-related SUFWS removes the core decay heat
after the reactor trip during postulated non-LOCA events.  Flow indication of the SUFWS is
provided in the MCR.  The SUFWS pumps automatically start following anticipated transients
resulting in low SG level.  The startup feedwater control valves automatically control feedwater
flow to the SGs during operation.  They can also be manually operated from the MCR. 
Operation of the SUFWS is not credited with mitigating licensing DBAs, as discussed in DCD
Tier 2, Chapter 15.  The safety-related PXS provides emergency core decay heat removal
during transients, accidents, or whenever the normal non-safety-related heat removal paths are
unavailable; DCD Tier 2, Section 6.3, describes this system.
On the basis of its review, discussed in Section 10.4.9 of this report, the staff concludes that
Issue II.E.1.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design because the SUFWS is non-safety-related.
Issue II.E.1.2:  Auxiliary Feedwater Automatic Initiation and Flow Indication
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.1.2 addresses improving the reliability of the AFWS or
EFWS.  It discusses the requirement in NUREG-0737 for plants to install a control-grade
system for automatic initiation of the EFWS.  The acceptance criteria are in NUREG-0737 and
in the design requirements of IEEE 279-1971.  Specifically, the system shall incorporate such
design features as automatic system initiation, protection from single failure, and environmental
and seismic equipment qualification.  The issue requires provisions for automatic and manual
AFWS initiation and for flow indication in the MCR.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Items (1)(ii) and (2)(xii), the applicant stated that the AP1000
design includes the non-safety-related SUFWS and not an AFWS.  Flow indication of the
SUFWS is provided in the MCR.  The SUFWS pumps automatically start following anticipated
transients resulting in reactor trips, and the control valves automatically control feedwater flow
to the SGs during operation.  They can also be manually operated from the MCR.  The
safety-related PXS provides emergency core decay heat removal during transients, accidents,
or whenever the normal heat removal paths are unavailable.
The AP1000 design does not use an AFWS.  The design employs a non-safety-related SUFWS
to remove the core decay heat after a reactor trip during non-LOCA events.  Because the
SUFWS is non-safety-related and not taken credit for in an accident, the system does not have
to meet all of the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991, “IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety
Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” which superseded IEEE Std 279-1971.  
However, flow indication is provided in the MCR, and the pumps automatically start following
anticipated transients resulting in a reactor trip and automatically control feedwater flow to the
SGs during power operation.  They can also be manually operated from the MCR.  The

safety-related PXS provides for emergency core cooling during transients and accidents, when
the normal heat removal paths are not available.
Although the AP1000 design does not have a safety-related AFWS, it provides the SUFWS,
which adequately addresses the requirements in this issue as discussed in Section 10.4.9 of
this report.
Therefore, Issue II.E.1.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.1.3:  Update Standard Review Plan and Development of Regulatory Guide
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.1.3 addresses improving the reliability of the AFWS or
the EFWS.  The NRC planned to update SRP Section 10.4.9 and revise RG 1.26, “Quality
Group Classifications and Standards for Water-, Steam-, and Radioactive-Waste-Containing
Components of Nuclear Power Plants (for Comment)” to include these systems and possibly
endorse certain standards.  The NRC updated the SRP section in July 1981 but found no
additional public and occupational risk reduction to support the need to revise the RG, and thus
did not revise it.  This issue is resolved because the changes to the SRP established the
requirements.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, the applicant stated that this issue was a requirement to
update SRP Section10.4.9 to address the requirements of Item II.E.1.1 and Item II.F.1.2 for the
AFWS.  The SRP is written for the safety-related AFWS with a seismic Category I water
source.  A safety-related AFWS also functions as an EFWS to remove heat from the primary
system when the main feedwater system is not available during emergency conditions.  The
AP1000 does not have an EFWS and does not include a seismic Category I water source for
either the main or startup feedwater systems.  The PRHR system provides the safety-related
function to remove heat from the primary system when the main feedwater is not available.  The
bases of the design criteria for the SUFWS are operational and investment protection
considerations and not the requirements of SRP Section 10.4.9 or RG 1.26. 
The SUFWS does not have to meet the requirements of SRP Section 10.4.9 and RG 1.26
because of design difference.  The SUFWS is a non-safety system and does not perform the
safety function of an EFWS.  
Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue II.E.1.3 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.2.2:  Research on Small-Break LOCAs and Anomalous Transients
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.2.2 addresses the NRC research programs focused
on SBLOCAs and reactor transients.  The programs include experimental research in the
loss-of-flow tests (LOFT), Semiscale LOFT, B&W integral systems test facilities, systems
engineering, and material effects programs, as well as analytical methods development and
assessments in the code development program.
The NRC completed the programs called for in this issue.  The programs showed that the
ECCS will provide adequate core cooling for SBLOCAs and anomalous transients consistent
with the single-failure criteria of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K.  Issue II.K.3(30) in this section
Generic Issues
20-86
addresses the application of the experimental data from the research programs to validate the
conservatism of the licensing codes used in the SBLOCAs .
The applicant did not address this issue in DCD Tier 2.  It concluded, in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design because the NRC resolved
this issue with no new requirements.
The AP1000 design is a PWR with passive safety systems evolved from the AP600 design,
which was the first passive ALWR design reviewed by the NRC.  The distinguishing feature of
this passive safety system design is a dependence on safety systems whose operation is driven
by natural forces, such as gravity and stored mechanical energy.
For a design with passive safety systems and without a prototype plant that will be tested over
an appropriate range of normal, transient, and accident conditions, 10 CFR 52.47(b)(2)(i)(A)
imposes the following requirements:

The performance of each safety feature of the design has been demonstrated through
either analysis, appropriate test programs, experience, or a combination thereof.

Interdependent effects among the safety features of the design have been found
acceptable by analysis, appropriate test programs, experience, or a combination
thereof.

Sufficient data exist on the safety features of the design to assess the analytical tools
used for safety and analyses over a sufficient range of normal operating conditions,
transient conditions, and specified accident sequences, including equilibrium core
conditions.
The staff has considered how the research for the nonpassive LWRs applies to the passive
safety system design.  While passive systems may be conceptually simpler than conventional
active systems, they may be potentially more susceptible to system interactions that can upset
the balance of forces upon which the passive systems depend for their operation.  Further,
these “passive” systems still rely on some active operation to place them in operation.
The applicant developed test programs designed to investigate the passive reactor and
containment safety systems, including component phenomenological (separate effects) tests
and integral systems tests.
As described in Chapter 21 of this report, the staff has evaluated and concluded that the
applicant’s earlier test program conducted for the AP600 is applicable to the AP1000 design,
except for the liquid entrainment through the upper plenum, hot leg, and out the ADS stage-4
valves.  The staff requested that the applicant provide additional test data on liquid entrainment. 
In its letter of April 11, 2003, “Response to NRC Letter from J.E. Lyons to W.E. Cummins,
‘AP1000 Request for Data to Resolve Liquid Entrainment Requests for Additional Information,’
dated March 18, 2003,” DCP/NRC1572, the applicant committed to present new test data in
support of AP1000 DC.  The applicant proceeded to obtain experimental data using the
APEX-AP1000 facility which were used to assess models in their thermal-hydraulic codes. 
These data were used in code assessment, and identified the need to perform a bounding
calculation to conservatively account for the effects of liquid entrainment.  Chapter 21 of this
Generic Issues
20-87
report discusses the staff evaluation of the APEX-AP1000 test program in support of AP1000. 
The staff considers Issue II.E.2.2 resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.3.1: Reliability of Power Supplies for Natural Circulation
Issue II.E.3.1 requires that emergency power be available to ensure that the RCS can maintain
natural circulation if offsite power is lost and that pressurizer heater motive and control power
shall interface with emergency buses through qualified devices.
The safety-related PXS can establish and maintain natural circulation cooling using the PRHR
HX, transferring the decay heat to the IRWST and to the PCS without the pressurizer heaters. 
Pressurizer heaters are not required for safety and do not require power from the Class 1E
system.
Therefore, Issue II.E.3.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.4.1:  Dedicated Penetrations
The AP1000 DSER regarding Issue II.E.4.1 stated the following:
This issue remains open because DCD Tier 2 does not comply with current regulations
for the control of combustible gas in containment during accidents.
The NRC has proposed major changes to 10 CFR 50.44, “Standards for Combustible
Gas Control System in Light-Water-Cooled Power Reactors,” and related changes to
10 CFR 50.34 and 10 CFR 52.47, along with the creation of a new rule, 10 CFR 50.46a
(see  67 FR 50374,dated August 2, 2002).  These proposed changes are meant to risk-
inform the combustible gas control requirements and constitute significant relaxations of
the requirements.  The staff plans to finalize the rule changes during 2003.
The applicant wrote DCD Tier 2 in anticipation of these rule changes.  Thus, it does not
comply with the current, more-restrictive regulations.  Furthermore, until the proposed
rule changes are final and effective, the staff cannot know for certain if the DCD will
comply with the revised rule.  
Therefore, the issue of containment combustible gas control, as well as Issue II.E.4.1,
must remain open at this time.
This is Open Item 6.2.5-1.
Subsequent to the publication of the DSER, the NRC revised its regulations regarding the
control of combustible gas in containment.  The revised regulations were published on
September 16, 2003, and became effective on October 16, 2003.  The NRC has extensively
revised 10 CFR 50.44, “Combustible Gas Control for Nuclear Power Reactors,” made
associated changes to Subsections 50.34 and 52.47, and added a new section,
Subsection 50.46a, “Acceptance Criteria for Reactor Coolant System Venting Systems.”  The
revisions apply to current power reactor licensees, and also consolidate combustible gas control
regulations for future power reactor applicants and licensees.  The revised rules eliminate the
requirements for hydrogen recombiners and hydrogen purge systems, and relax the
Generic Issues
20-88
requirements for hydrogen and oxygen monitoring equipment to make them commensurate
with their risk significance.
TMI Action Plan Requirement II.E.4.1 of NUREG-0737 stated that plants using external
recombiners or purge systems for postaccident combustible gas control of the containment
atmosphere should have containment penetration systems for external recombiner or purge
systems that are dedicated to that service only, that meet the redundancy and single-failure
requirements of GDC 54 and 56 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50, and that are sized to satisfy
the flow requirements of the recombiner or purge system.  However, as stated above, the
revised rules eliminate the requirements for hydrogen recombiners and hydrogen purge
systems, and therefore Issue II.E.4.1 has been closed generically.
In conclusion, Open Item 6.2.5-1 is closed and Issue II.E.4.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.4.2:  Isolation Dependability
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.4.2 addresses improving the reliability and capability
of containment structures to reduce the radiological consequences to the public from accidents,
including degraded core events.  The issue specifically addresses the need for dependable
isolation of containment penetrations.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xiv), the applicant stated that the AP1000 containment
isolation design satisfies NRC requirements, including post-TMI requirements.  It further
explains that two barriers are provided, one inside containment and one outside.  These
barriers are usually valves, but in some cases they are closed, seismic Category I piping
systems not connected to the RCS or to the containment atmosphere.  The design incorporates
fewer containment penetrations than previous plant designs, and the majority are normally
closed.  Those few that are normally open use “automatically closed,” failed-close isolation
valves.  The penetrations do not automatically reopen on the resetting of the isolation signal. 
Containment isolation is automatically actuated by diverse signals and can be manually initiated
from the MCR.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.3, provides additional information.
The acceptance criteria for SRP Section 6.2.4 encompass the Issue II.E.4.2 requirements.  The
staff considered the relevant requirements in its review of the containment isolation system. 
Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue II.E.4.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.4.4:  Purging
Issue II.E.4.4 served to improve the vent/purge valve isolation reliability of pre-TMI facilities. 
The vent/purge isolation valve operators at many of those facilities were not originally selected
with consideration of torque capability to close against LOCA dynamic forces.  In addition,
Issue II.E.4.4 restricts containment vent/purge operations to safety-related purposes, thus
reducing the likelihood that the valves would be open in the event of a LOCA.
DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, states that the AP1000 will meet the Issue II.E.4.4 requirement. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.3.1.3.F, states, “Isolation valves are designed to have the capacity to
close against the conditions that may exist during events requiring containment isolation.” 
Technical specifications will preclude unnecessary venting.  The AP1000 design provides

debris screens to protect the isolation valves from LOCA blowdown debris.  Therefore, the staff
concludes that Issue II.E.4.4 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.5.1:  Design Evaluation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.5.1 addresses the requirement for B&W licensees to
propose recommendations on hardware and procedural changes relative to the need for
methods for damping primary system sensitivity to perturbations in the once-through SG.  As
stated in 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xvi), the applicant should establish a design criterion for the
allowable number of actuation cycles of the ECCS and RPS consistent with the expected
occurrence rate of severe overcooling events, considering anticipated transients and accidents.
DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, states that this issue applies only to B&W designs.  The AP1000
design uses the PXS to provide emergency reactor coolant inventory control and emergency
decay heat removal.  Component design criteria have been established for the number of
actuation cycles for the PXS.  The identified actuation cycles include inadvertent actuation, as
well as the system response to expected plant trip occurrences, including overcooling events. 
Operation of the ADS is not expected for either design-basis or best-estimate overcooling
events.  DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.1, includes additional information.
In the staff’s evaluation of Issue II.E.5.1 addressed in Section 3.9.1.1, “Design Transients,” of
this report, the staff concludes that this issue is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.E.6.1:  Test Adequacy Study
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.E.6.1 addresses the adequacy of the requirements for
safety-related valve testing.  Valve performance is critical to the successful functioning of a
large number of plant safety systems.  The staff divided this issue into the following four parts
during its resolution:

testing of pressure isolation valves (PIVs)

in situ testing and surveillance of check valves

reevaluation of the thermal-overload protection provisions for MOVs in RG 1.106,
“Thermal Overload Protection for Electric Motors on Motor-Operated Valves” 

operability verification for MOVs in accordance with GL 89-10
Section 3.9.6.2 of this report discusses the staff’s evaluations of the first two parts, testing of
PIVs and check valves.  The staff also discussed the last two parts in the list above in
Section 3.9.6.2 of this report as a part of the resolution of GL 89-10.  Since the resolution of the
four separate parts listed above subsumed the resolution of Issue II.E.6.1, and on the basis of
the staff’s evaluations and resolution of the issues discussed above, the staff concludes that
Issue II.E.6.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-90
Issue II.F.1:  Additional Accident Monitoring Instrumentation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.F.1 addresses the provision of instrumentation to
monitor plant variables and systems during and following an accident.  The issue addressed the
need for plants to include instrumentation to measure, record, and read out in the MCR the
following containment parameters:

pressure

water level

hydrogen concentration

high-range radiation

noble gas effluents
The staff clarified Issue II.F.1 in NUREG-0737 and issued requirements.  The radiation and
noble gas effluent instrumentation must provide for continuous sampling of radioactive iodine
and particulates at all potential accident release points and for onsite capability to analyze and
measure these samples.  The acceptance criterion is the guidance in RG 1.97, Revision 3,
dated May 1983.  NUREG-0660 also provides the requirements for a human factors analysis,
which includes the operator’s use of the indicators listed above during normal and abnormal
plant conditions, integration of these indicators in plant EOPs and operator training, the use of
other alarms, and the need for prioritization of alarms.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xvii), the applicant stated that DCD Tier 2, Chapter 7
describes the AP1000 postaccident monitoring system.
The system provides indication of the following plant parameters:

containment pressure

containment water level

containment radiation (high level)

noble gases effluents to ascertain RCS integrity
In DCD Tier 2, Section 7.5, the applicant compared the AP1000 design to the criteria in
RG 1.97 and addressed accident monitoring instrumentation. 
The hydrogen monitors are not part of postaccident monitoring.  Other noble gas effluents are
designated Type E variables and include information that permits the operator to take the
following actions:

monitor the habitability of the MCR

monitor plant areas where access may be required to service equipment necessary to
monitor or mitigate the consequences of an accident

estimate the magnitude of release of radioactive materials through identified pathways

monitor radiation levels and radioactivity in the environment surrounding the plant
Generic Issues
20-91
DCD Tier 2, Section 11.5.5, includes additional discussion on the measurement of radioactive
effluents and conformance of the AP1000 design with RG 1.97.  Section II.F.1(3) of
NUREG-0737 requires that the reactor containment be equipped with two physically separate
radiation monitoring systems that are capable of measuring up to 105 Gray (Gy) per hour (/hr)
(107 Rad per hour (R/hr) in the containment following an accident.  In DCD Tier 2,
Section 11.5.6.2, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design will incorporate four electrically
independent ion chambers located inside the containment to measure high-range gamma
radiation.  These detectors, mounted on the inner containment wall in widely separated
locations, will have an unobstructed “view” of a representative volume of the containment
atmosphere.  The design and qualification of these monitors comply with the guidelines of
RG 1.97 and 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xvii) with respect to detector range, response, redundancy,
separation, onsite calibration, and environmental design qualification.  The staff, therefore, finds
these monitors to be acceptable.
The AP1000 primary sampling system is designed to provide post-accident sampling functions
(as addressed in DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.3.1).  Chapter 18 of this report addresses the human
factors aspects of this issue.  Section 7.5 of this report discusses accident monitoring
instrumentation. 
Therefore, Issue II.F.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.F.2:  Identification of and Recovery from Conditions Leading to Inadequate Core
Cooling
10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xviii) requires that instruments be provided in the MCR.  These instruments
must have an unambiguous indication of inadequate core cooling (ICC), such as primary
coolant saturation meters in PWRs, and a suitable combination of signals from indicators of
coolant level in the reactor vessel and in-core thermocouples in PWRs and BWRs.  The TMI
Action Plan Item II.F.2 discusses the ICC phenomena and the need to have a reactor water
level indication system that displays the reactor coolant void fraction when the RCPs are
operating and reactor vessel water level when the RCPs are tripped.
Before the TMI accident, an accepted operational practice at PWRs was to operate the RCPs, if
they were available, during a LOCA to provide continued core cooling.  During the TMI LOCA
event with the PORVs stuck in the open position, the reactor coolant continued to leak through
the open valves, the pressurizer level indicated high, and subsequent ICC occurred because
the reactor coolant was highly voided.  Nevertheless, the continued operation of the RCPs
maintained core cooling.  Subsequently, the RCPs were tripped, and because of high void
content in the coolant, the water level dropped below the top of the core causing fuel damage. 
As a result of the lessons learned from TMI, the reactor vessel water level indication system
was added, specifically for PWRs, to ensure operator action to trip the RCPs following a LOCA
earlier in the LOCA sequence to prevent an ICC event.  NUREG/CR-5374, “Summary of
Inadequate Core Cooling Instrumentation for U.S. Nuclear Power Plants,” discusses acceptable
approaches to instrumentation that addresses ICC.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3(2)(xviii), the applicant stated that the AP1000 reactor system
includes instrumentation for detecting voids in the reactor vessel head and other reactor vessel
inventory deficits that could lead to ICC.  The applicant also listed the AP1000 features that
Generic Issues
20-92
provide margin to or indication of ICC, with additional information provided in DCD Tier 2,
Sections 6.3 and 7.5.
In response to RAI 440.127, the applicant explained that the AP1000 design concept is different
from current operating plants in that the AP1000 design automatically trips the RCPs and
initiates safeguard injections through the passive safety systems such as the CMT, ADS,
PRHR, and IRWST to maintain core cooling in the event of a SBLOCA.  The AP1000 does not
rely on a reactor vessel level indication system as do existing reactors, where reactor vessel
level indication is important for operator actions to trip the RCPs, to monitor coolant mass in the
vessel, and to manually depressurize the RCS in the event of ICC.  In the AP1000, the operator
does not need to (1) trip the RCPs, (2) inject water into the core, or (3) manually depressurize
the plant during an SBLOCA.
The instruments typically used in current PWRs include subcooling margin monitoring
capability, core exit thermocouples, and a reactor vessel level indication system, which together
give the operator the ability to monitor the coolant conditions and to act appropriately to ensure
core cooling during the approach to the ICC conditions and to recover from those conditions. 
The AP1000 design includes subcooling margin monitoring capability, core-exit thermocouples,
and the hot-leg level indication system.  The AP1000 hot-leg level indication system is different
from the reactor vessel level indication systems currently used in the applicant’s plants.
The AP1000 hot-leg level indication is a safety-related level indication system, which consists of
separate pressure taps that connect to the bottom of the hot leg and to the top of the hot-leg
bend leading to the SG.  This system can indicate reactor water vessel level for a range
spanning from the bottom of the hot leg to approximately the elevation of the vessel mating
surface.
However, during the operation of the ADS to depressurize the plant, the reactor vessel water
level will vary greatly and will not reliably indicate ICC.  The AP1000 hot-leg water level
indication does not direct operator actions, even when the water level may potentially drop
below the hot-leg level.  Therefore, the water level is not an important indication for mitigation of
ICC in the AP1000 design.  However, the hot-leg level indication system does verify reactor
water inventory to terminate the recovery action in the ERGs for the ICC event.
Because the AP1000 design automatically trips the RCPs during an SBLOCA event, and
because the operators are unlikely to be misled by forced two-phase flow, the core exit
temperature is an important and sufficient indication of an approach to ICC conditions.  The
temperature reading provided by core exit thermocouples is appropriately included in the ERGs
for plant recovery.
The staff reviewed the applicant’s response and determined that for an SBLOCA event, a
safeguard signal would automatically trip the RCPs, passive safety systems such as the CMT
would automatically inject water into the core, the ADS would automatically initiate to
depressurize the plant, the reactor coolant would automatically be cooled by the PRHR, and
subsequent injection from the IRWST would occur.  The staff also determined that for the
AP1000 design, the core exit thermocouples and the subcooling margin monitoring together
would unambiguously indicate an approach to ICC, and the safety-related hot-leg level
indication is used only to terminate the recovery action in the ERGs for the ICC event. 
Generic Issues
20-93
Therefore, the applicant has satisfied the requirements for ICC, as discussed in
10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xviii).  Issue II.F.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.F.3:  Instrumentation for Monitoring Accident Conditions
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.F.3 addressed the adequacy and availability of
instrumentation that monitors plant variables and systems during and following an accident that
includes core damage.  Before the TMI-2 accident, the accident monitoring instrumentation in
nuclear power generating stations followed the guidance in RG 1.97 (Revision 1) and
ANSI/ANS Standard 4.5, “Criteria for Accident Monitoring Functions in Light-Water Cooled
Reactors.”
The acceptance criterion for the resolution of this issue is that instrumentation will be of
sufficient quantity, range, availability, and reliability to permit adequate monitoring of plant
variables and systems during and after an accident.  Specifically, the instrumentation should
conform to the guidance in RG 1.97 (Revision 3) and ANSI/ANS Standard 4.5 and should
provide sufficient information to the operator for (1) taking planned manual actions to shut the
plant down safely, (2) determining whether the reactor trip, ESF systems, and manually initiated
safety-related systems are performing their intended safety functions (i.e., reactivity control,
core cooling, and maintaining RCS and containment integrity), and (3) determining the potential
for causing a gross breach of the barriers to radioactivity release (i.e., fuel cladding, RCPB, and
containment) and determining if a gross breach has occurred.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xix), the applicant stated that the AP1000 postaccident
monitoring system is designed using RG 1.97 as a guidance document.  Either the normal MCR
display system or the QDPS displays data used for postaccident monitoring.  The normal MCR
display system displays non-safety-related signals which need not be displayed by a qualified
system.  The QDPS provides for the display of signals that must be displayed by a qualified
system.  The QDPS is a Class 1E microprocessor-based system that provides instrumentation
to monitor plant variables and systems during and following an accident.  It consists of two
independent, electrically isolated, physically separated divisions.  The preceeding response for
Issue II.F.1 and DCD Tier 2, Section 7.5, provides additional information.
On the basis of the above and the staff’s review in Section 7.5.9 of this report, the staff
concludes that the AP1000 design meets the requirements of Issue II.F.3.
Issue II.G.1:  Power Supplies for Pressurizer Relief Valves, Block Valves, and Level Indicators
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.G.1 addresses upgrading the emergency power for the 
pressurizer relief and block valves and pressurizer level indicators.  In accordance with the
requirements in NUREG-0737, an emergency source of power must supply the pressurizer
equipment in the event of a LOOP.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not include
PORVs and their associated block valves.  Pressurizer level indication is provided by
instrumentation powered from the Class 1E dc power system.  This system provides safety-
related, uninterruptible power for Class 1E plant instrumentation, control, monitoring, and other
vital functions, including safety-related components essential for safe shutdown of the plant. 
Generic Issues
20-94
The system is designed such that these essential plant loads are powered during emergency
plant conditions when both onsite and offsite ac power sources are not available. 
Based on the above, the staff concludes that the AP1000 design meets the requirements of
Issue II.G.1.
Issue II.J.3.1:  Organization and Staffing to Oversee Design and Construction
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.J.3.1 addresses requiring license applicants and
licensees to improve the oversight of design, construction, and modification activities so that
they will gain the critical expertise necessary for the safe operation of the plant.  Issue I.B.1.1,
“Organization and Management Long Term Improvements,” which was resolved with changes
to RG 1.8, “Qualification and Training of Personnel for Nuclear Power Plants,” and RG 1.33,
“Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation),” included this issue.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (3)(vii), the applicant stated that it has devised a
management plan for the AP1000 project that consists of a “properly” structured organization
with open lines of communication, “clearly defined” responsibilities, “well-coordinated” technical
efforts, and “appropriate” control channels.  The COL applicant will determine the procedures to
be used in the construction, startup, and operation phases of the AP1000.
The organization of the plant beyond the AP1000 design, the construction of the plant, and the
modification of the plant is outside the scope of DC for the AP1000 design.  In part, these
concerns involve the organization of the COL applicant; however, the concerns about design of
the plant outside of the AP1000 design and construction do not involve the organization of the
site operation.  Therefore, the COL applicant will have the responsibility for addressing these
concerns as part of the COL licensing process.  This is COL Action Item 20.4-3.
Chapter 17 of this report discusses and finds acceptable the QA standards and the organization
that the applicant used for the design of the AP1000.  Furthermore, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
the applicant stated that this item is the responsibility of the COL applicant.
Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue II.J.3.1 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.J.4.1:  Revise Deficiency Reporting Requirements
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.J.4.1 addresses assuring that the applicant promptly
report all reportable items and submit complete information to the NRC.  The issue was
resolved when the NRC issued new requirements in 10 CFR Part 21, “Reporting of Defects and
Noncompliance,” and 10 CFR 50.55(e), on July 31, 1991.  
The COL applicant will be responsible for having the proper reporting procedures and
addressing this issue as part of the licensing process.  This is part of the plant procedures
development by the COL applicant.  This is COL Action Item 20.4-4.
As indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645.  Therefore, the staff concludes that Issue II.J.4.1 is resolved for the AP1000
design.

Issue II.K.1(3):  Review Operating Procedures for Recognizing, Preventing, and Mitigating Void
Formation in Transients and Accidents
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(3) requests licensees to have operating procedures
for recognizing, preventing, and mitigating void formation in the RCS during transients and
accidents to avoid loss of the core cooling capability during natural circulation.
The staff has reviewed the resolution of Issue I.C.I and ERG AES-0.2, “Natural Circulation
Cooldown.”  There are ERGs that direct the operators to cool down and depressurize the plant
using natural circulation conditions by dumping steam and subsequent RNS operation.  These
steps are specified to preclude any possible upper head voids formation and to direct the
operators to verify that a steam void does not exit in the vessel.  On the basis of this review, the
staff concludes that the ERGs direct plant operators to recognize and to preclude voids
formation in the vessel.  Therefore, the staff considers Issue II.K.1(3) resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue II.K.1(4d):  Review Operating Procedures and Training to Ensure That Operators Are
Instructed Not to Rely on Level Alone in Evaluating Plant Conditions
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(4d) asks licensees to provide operating procedures
to ensure that operators will not rely on level indication alone in evaluating plant conditions.  As
stated in NUREG-0933, the staff determined that Issues I.A.3.1, I.C.1, and II.F.2 cover this
issue and that this issue is resolved.
The NRC implemented Issue I.A.3.1, “Revise Scope and Criteria for Licensing Examinations,”
by a rule change to 10 CFR Part 55, “Operators Licenses,” to require a simulator as part of the
reactor operator licensing examinations.  The staff will impose the requirements of 10 CFR
55.45 on the COL applicant referencing the AP1000 design; therefore, the applicant does not
have to address Issue I.A.3.1 for compliance with 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv).
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue is not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is not a DC issue, but is the
responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is COL Action Item 20.1.4-1.  However, the applicant
has earlier stated that the proposed resolution to Issues I.C.1 and II.F.2 addresses the design
portion of this item.
The staff completed its review of Issues I.C.I and II.F.2 and concluded that AP1000 ERGs, as
described in Section 18.9 of this report, do not instruct the operators to rely on level indication
alone in evaluating plant conditions.  Operators determine the status of core cooling by
indications of core-exit thermocouple temperature, RCS subcooling, and RCS hot-leg
temperature, in addition to RCS level.  The staff considers these issues resolved.  Therefore,
Issue II.K.1(4d) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.1(5):  Safety-Related Valve Position Description
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(5) addresses the need to (1) review all valve
positions and positioning requirements and positive controls, along with all related test and
maintenance procedures to assure proper ESF functioning, if required, and (2) verify that AFW
Generic Issues
20-96
valves are in the open position.  This issue was resolved and NUREG-0737 issued additional
requirements.
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue is not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is the responsibility of the COL
applicant.  This is COL Action Item 20.1.4-1.
As indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant has satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645.  The staff concludes that WCAP-14645 is applicable to the AP1000 design;
therefore, Issue II.K.1(5) is resolved.
Issue II.K.1(10):  Review and Modify Procedures for Removing Safety-Related Systems from
Service
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(10) addresses the requirement that licensees
review and modify, as needed, the procedures for removing safety-related systems from
service, and restoring them to service, to assure that the operability status of the systems is
known.  
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue was not relevant to the AP1000 design because it is the responsibility of the COL
applicant.  This is COL Action Item 13.5-1.
As indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645.  The staff concludes that WCAP-14645 is applicable to the AP1000 design;
therefore, Issue II.K.1(10) is resolved.
Issue II.K.1(13):  Propose Technical Specification Changes Reflecting Implementation of All
Bulletin Items
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(13) addresses the requirement for operating plants
to propose TS reflecting the requirements in the BLs issued by the Commission for the TMI
Action Plan.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, Westinghouse stated that it based the AP1000 TS (DCD
Tier 2, Section 16.1) on and reviewed them against the Westinghouse standard TS (STS),
which incorporates the requirements of the BLs for the TMI Action Plan.  Chapter 16 of this
report evaluates the AP1000 TS.  The staff reviewed the AP1000 TS against the STS.  On the
basis of this review, the staff concludes that the approved AP1000 TS incorporate all the
appropriate BL requirements from the TMI Action Plan.  Section 20.7 of this report discusses
the incorporation of operating experience in BLs in the AP1000 design.
Therefore, Issue II.K.1(13) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-97
Issue II.K.1(16):  Implement Procedures That Identify Pressurizer (PZR) PORV “Open”
Indications and That Direct Operators to Close Valve Manually at “Reset” Setpoint
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(16) addresses requiring procedures that identified
PZR PORV “open” indications and directed operators to close the valve manually at the “reset”
setpoint.  The staff determined in NUREG-0933 that Issues I.C.1 and II.D.3 cover this issue. 
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant stated that this issue does not apply to the AP1000
design and the issue is applicable only to currently operating plants.  The staff agrees with the
applicant’s assessment because this issue is related to PORV positions and the AP1000 design
does not include these valves.  Therefore, Issue II.K.1(16) does not apply to the AP1000
design.
Issue II.K.1(17):  Trip Pressurizer Level Bistable So That Pressurizer Low Pressure Will Initiate
Safety Injection
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Item II.K.1(17) addresses the requirement for the applicant’s
plants to trip the PZR level bistable so that the PZR low pressure, rather than the PZR low
pressure and pressurizer low-level coincidence, will initiate safety injection.
The AP1000 design does not depend on PZR low pressure and PZR low-level coincidence to
initiate safety injection in the event of a LOCA.  Safety injection in the AP1000 design is
automatic.  As described in DCD Tier 2, Section 7.3.1.1, the safeguard signals that initiate
safety injection are Low-1 PZR pressure, High-2 containment pressure, low compensated
steamline pressure, or low cold-leg temperature.  In addition, the AP1000 design gives the
operator manual safety injection capability.  The staff concludes that any single safeguard
signal mentioned above would initiate safety injection.  Therefore, Issue II.K.1(17) is resolved
for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.1(22):  Describe Automatic and Manual Actions for Proper Functioning of Auxiliary
Heat Removal Systems When Feedwater System Is Not Operable
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(22) addresses the requirement for BWR plants that
auxiliary heat removal systems should be designed such that necessary automatic and manual
actions ensure proper functioning of the systems when the main feedwater system is not
operable.
The applicant stated in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that it considers Issue II.K.1(22) relevant to the
AP1000 design; however, resolution of this issue is not necessary for the AP1000 design to
meet 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(ii) or (iv).
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xxi), the applicant stated that, although this issue applies
only to BWRs in NUREG-0660, there are some considerations for the AP1000 design. 
Following a loss of main feedwater (LMFW), a number of plant systems automatically actuate to
provide decay heat removal.  The non-safety-related DGs can power the non-safety-related
SUFWS, which is automatically actuated and controlled by low SG level.  For design-basis
events, the safety-related PXS includes PRHR HXs, which automatically actuate to provide
emergency core decay heat removal if the non-safety-related systems are not available.  The
Generic Issues
20-98
MCR meets the NRC guidelines for manual actuation of protective functions, including those
used in an LMFW event.  In DCD Tier 2, Sections 6.3 and 10.4 provide additional information.
On the basis of its review, which is discussed in Section 10.4.9 of this report, the staff
concludes that Issue II.K.1(22) is resolved for the AP1000 design because the SUFWS is
automatically actuated and controlled following an LMFW, and the PXS is automatically
actuated if the non-safety-related systems are not available.
Issue II.K.1(24):  Perform LOCA Analyses for a Range of Small-Break Sizes and a Range of 
Time Lapses Between Reactor Trip and RCP Trip
Issue II.K.1(24) of NUREG-0933 requires PWR licensees to perform a LOCA analysis for a
range of small-break sizes and a range of time lapses between reactor trip and RCP trip.  The
staff determined in NUREG-0933 that Issue I.C.1 covered this issue for PWRs.
The staff has reviewed the responses to Issue I.C.1 and concluded that the AP1000 design
automatically trips the RCPs during a LOCA event.  The guideline directs the operators to verify
that all RCPs have been tripped, and if they have not, the operators are directed to manually
trip the RCPs.  On the basis of the plant design features and the appropriate operator actions
using the ERGs, the staff considers Issue II.K.1(24) resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.1(25):  Develop Operator Action Guidelines
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(25) required PWR licensees to develop operator
action guidelines on the basis of the analyses performed in response to Issue II.K.1(24), which
is discussed above.  The staff determined in NUREG-0933 that Issue I.C.1 covers this issue.
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant indicated, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that one or more issues have superseded this issue.  As stated above, Issue I.C.1 covers this
issue, and the applicant considers Issue I.C.1 to be the sole responsibility of the COL applicant.
The final procedures would be the responsibility of the COL applicant, however; the LOCA
analyses for a range of time lapses and the specific information to go into the procedures would
be the responsibility of the designer, or the applicant in the case of the AP1000 design.  In DCD
Tier 2, Chapter 15, the applicant addresses accidents for the AP1000 design.
As discussed in Section 20.4 of this report, the staff has completed its review of Issue I.C.1 and
concludes that Issue I.C.1 is resolved.  Therefore, Issue II.K.1(25) is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue II.K.1(26):  Revise Emergency Procedures and Train Reactor Operators (ROs) and
Senior Reactor Operators (SROs)
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(26) addressed requiring all operating PWRs to
revise their EOPs and to train the ROs and SROs for the plant, on the basis of guidelines
developed in response to Issue II.K.1(25), which is discussed above.  The staff determined in
NUREG-0933, that Issues I.A.3.1, “Revise Scope of Criteria for Licensing Examinations,” I.C.1,
and I.G.1, cover this issue. 
Generic Issues
20-99
As stated in NUREG-0933, the staff has implemented Issues I.A.3.1, I.C.1, and I.G.1 in its
review of reactor plant designs, and the applicant does not need to address them for
compliance with 10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv).
DCD Tier 2 does not address this issue.  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2,
that this issue is not relevant to the AP1000 design because one or more other issues have
superseded it.  As stated above, Issues I.A.3.1, I.C.1, and I.G.1 cover this issue, and the
applicant considers these issues to be the sole responsibility of the COL applicant.
An earlier part of this section addressed Issue 1.C.1.  Issue I.A.3.1 involved the revision of the
scope of examinations and criteria for licensing examinations, and Issue I.G.1 concerned new
training requirements for operators.  In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant identified
Issues I.A.3.1 and I.G.1 as the responsibility of the COL applicant rather than the responsibility
of the applicant in the AP1000 design review.
The preceding section discusses the guidelines developed as part of Issue II.K.1(25).   Also, as
indicated in Section 18.3, of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed Issue I.C.1 of this
item in WCAP-14645, because the staff has concluded that WCAP-14645 is applicable to the
AP1000 design.
However, the staff also identified COL Action Item 20.4-5 for Issue II.K.1(26).  This action item
requires that the COL applicant address the scope of licensing examinations (Issue I.A.3.1), as
well as new training requirements for operators (Issue I.G.1).
Therefore, Issue II.K.1(26) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.1(27):  Provide Analyses and Develop Guidelines and Procedures for Inadequate
Core Cooling Conditions
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(27) addresses the need for PWR licensees to
provide analyses and to develop guidelines and procedures for an ICC condition.  The staff
determined in NUREG-0933 that Issues I.C.1 and II.F.2 cover this issue.  An earlier part of this
section discussed the resolution of Issues I.C.1 and II.F.2 for the AP1000 design.
DCD Tier 2 does not address Issue II.K.1(27).  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that this issue is not relevant to the AP1000 design because one or more other
issues have superseded it.  Although, as stated above, Issues I.C.1 and II.F.2 cover this issue,
the applicant considers it the sole responsibility of the COL applicant.  The applicant addressed
Issue II.F.2 in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xviii).
As described in Section 18.9 of this report, the applicant’s ERGs provide high-level guidance for
dealing with ICC conditions.  The staff reviewed AFR-C.1, “AP600 Response to Inadequate
Core Cooling Procedure and Analysis Bases,” which describes how passive safety-related
systems automatically trip the RCS pumps and depressurize the RCS to inject water into the
core upon receiving a safeguard signal. This procedure instructs the operators to monitor plant
conditions using core-exit temperature and indicated hot-leg level, which is designed to indicate
an approach to ICC and to recover from an ICC condition.  The procedure also instructs
operators to manually initiate injection when automatic passive safety injections fail.  Passive
safety-related system actuation indications of the CMT, ADS, PRHR, and IRWST are integrated
Generic Issues
20-100
into the procedures, which provide operators with directions to ensure that maintenance of
adequate core cooling will be maintained.  The staff concludes that the above information is
applicable to the AP1000 design, as passive safety-related systems of the AP600 are similar to
the systems in the AP1000.
The staff concludes that the applicant has provided appropriate analyses and procedures to
mitigate ICC conditions.  Therefore, Issue II.K.1(27) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.1(28):  Provide Design That Will Assure Automatic RCP Trip for All Circumstances
Where Required
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.1(28) addresses the requirement that PWRs be
designed to ensure automatic RCP trip for all circumstances where required.  The staff
determined in NUREG-0933 that Issue II.K.3(5), “Automatic Trip of Reactor Coolant Pumps,”
covers this issue.
DCD Tier 2 does not address Issue II.K.1(28).  The applicant concluded, in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that this issue is not relevant to the AP1000 design because one or more other
issues (i.e., Issue II.K.3(5)) had superseded it.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, the applicant
responded to Issue II.K.3(5), stating that the AP1000 design provides for an automatic trip of
the RCPs on actuation of the PXS.  This trip is provided to prevent RCP interaction with the
operation of the CMT.  The staff concludes that Issue II.K.1(28), as well as II.K.3(5), is resolved
for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.2(10):  Hard-Wired Safety-Grade Anticipatory Reactor Trips
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.2(10) addresses the requirement for B&W plants to
provide a design and schedule for implementation of a safety-grade reactor trip on LMFW,
turbine trip, and significant reduction in SG level.  These requirements appear as Item 5 in NRC
bulletin, BL 79-05B, “Nuclear Incident at Three Mile Island - Supplement,” issued on April 21,
1979.  The NRC resolved this issue and established new requirements.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xxiii), the applicant stated that this issue applies only to
B&W plants, but that the AP1000 trip logic includes an anticipatory reactor trip for LMFW by
using low SG water level.  It also stated that DCD Tier 2, Section 7.2, has additional
information.
The applicant further stated that because the AP1000 design does not include PORVs and
block valves, the anticipatory reactor trip on a turbine trip is not needed.  The staff agrees with
the applicant’s statements and considers Issue II.K.2(10) resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.2(16):  Impact of RCP Seal Damage Following Small-Break LOCA with Loss of
Offsite Power
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.2(16) requires licensees to evaluate the likelihood and
consequences of RCP seal damage following an SBLOCA with a loss of LOOP. 
Generic Issues
20-101
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(iii), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design uses
canned-motor RCPs.  This canned-motor pump design does not have a seal that can fail and
initiate RCS leakage.
The staff determined that Issue 23, covers this issue.  The staff approved the resolution of
Issue 23 for the AP1000 design in Section 20.3 of this report.  Therefore, Issue II.K.2(16) is
resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(1):  Install Automatic PORV Isolation System and Perform Operational Test 
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(1) addresses the requirement in NUREG-0737 and
NUREG-0660 for PWR operating plants to provide a system that uses the PORV block valves
to protect against SBLOCAs.  This system would automatically cause the block valves to close
when the RCS pressure decays after the PORV has opened.
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9.2, the applicant indicated that Issue II.K.3(1) is resolved for the
AP1000 by the establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance.  In DCD Tier 2,
Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(iv), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not include
PORVs.  The PZR volume is about 40 percent larger than the PZR volume in current PWRs
with a comparable power rating.  This larger volume increases transient operation margins and
prevents safety valve actuation in most accident situations.  The PZR surge line is also larger to
permit a more rapid transfer of coolant between the RCS and the PZR and to accommodate the
ADS first- to third-stage flow rates.  The surge line limits the pressure drop during maximum
anticipated surge to prevent exceeding the maximum RCS pressure limit.
The applicant also stated that two totally enclosed pop-type safety valves provide overpressure
protection.  These valves are spring-loaded and self-actuated, and they are designed to meet
the requirements of ASME Code, Section III.  If the PZR pressure exceeds the set pressure, the
safety valves start lifting.  A temperature indicator in the discharge piping for each safety valve
alarms on high temperature to alert the operator to the presence of high-temperature fluid from
leakage when the valves open.  The AP1000 design includes an ADS consisting of six parallel
sets of two valves in series connected to the PZR and two parallel sets of two valves in series,
with one set connected to each RCS hot leg.  
On the basis of this information and because the AP1000 design does not have a PORV,
Issue II.K.3(1) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(2):  Report on Overall Safety Effect of PORV Isolation System
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(2) requires applicants to document the action to be
taken to decrease the probability of an SBLOCA caused by a stuck-open PORV.  The design
purpose of PORVs is to prevent RCS overpressure and to reduce the challenge to
spring-operated safety valves for design-basis events.
In DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, the applicant indicated that Issue II.K.3(1) is resolved for the
AP1000 by the establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance.  In DCD Tier 2,
Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(iv), the applicant stated that the AP1000 design does not include
PORVs.  It further described the AP1000 PZR design, including the PZR safety valves and
Generic Issues
20-102
ADS, to justify the appropriateness of the AP1000 design.  (See the discussion in
Issue II.K.3(1) above.)
On the basis of the preceding discussion and because the AP1000 design does not include a
PORV, Issue II.K.3(2) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(5):  Automatic Trip of Reactor Coolant Pumps
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(5) addresses requiring PWR licensees to study the
need for an automatic trip of the RCPs and to modify plant procedures or the design, as
appropriate.  Licensees should know how to operate the RCPs in order to mitigate transients
and accidents.  Licensees should consider the preservation of the maximum RCS inventory in
the SBLOCA mitigation and the most effective DHR strategy for the mitigation of other
transients.
In DCD Section 1.9.4.2.1, the applicant stated that the AP1000 design provides for an
automatic trip of the RCPs upon actuation of the PXS.  This trip is provided to prevent RCP
interaction with the operation of the CMT.  DCD Tier 2, Section 6.3, provides additional
information regarding the automatic RCP trip.
On the basis of this information, the staff concludes that Issue II.K.3(5) is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(6):  Instrumentation to Verify Natural Circulation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(6) addresses the requirement for licensees to
provide instrumentation to verify natural circulation during transient conditions.  The staff
determined in NUREG-0933 that Issues I.C.1, II.F.2, and II.F.3 cover this issue.
The applicant does not address this issue in Section 1.9.4.2.1 because DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, indicates that other issues supersede it.
On the basis of its review of the compliance of the AP1000 design with Issues I.C.1, II.F.2, and
II.F.3, as described in this report, the staff concludes that those issues relevant to the resolution
of the TMI Action Item II.K.3(6) have been resolved.  The respective TMI item discussions
provide more detailed information.  Therefore, Issue II.K.3(6) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(8):  Further Staff Consideration of Need for Diverse Decay Heat Removal Method
Independent of Steam Generators (SGs)
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(8) addresses further staff consideration of the need
for diverse decay heat removal methods, which are independent of the SGs.  The staff has
determined in NUREG-0933 that Issues II.C.1, “Interim Reliability Evaluation Program,” and
II.E.3.3, “Coordinated Study of Shutdown Heat Removal Requirements,” cover this issue.  In
NUREG-0933, the staff also stated that Issue A-45, “Shutdown Decay Heat Removal
Requirements,” addressed Issue II.E.3.3.
The applicant does not address this issue in Section 1.9.4.2.1 but indicated in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that other issues supersede it.  As stated in NUREG-0933, the staff implemented
Generic Issues
20-103
Issues A-45, II.C.1, and II.E.3.3 in its review of reactor plant designs, and the applicant and
the staff do not have to address these issues to demonstrate compliance with
10 CFR 52.47(a)(1)(iv).
In DCD Tier 2, Appendix 19E, the applicant described the AP1000 shutdown evaluation. 
Appendix 19E describes multiple decay heat removal capabilities independent of the SG.
Chapter 19.3 of this report includes detailed discussion of the multiple decay heat capabilities. 
On the basis of the staff’s review, Issue II.K.3(8) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(9):  Proportional Integral Derivative Controller Modification
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(9) addresses requiring the applicant’s plants to
raise the interlock bistable trip setting to preclude derivative action from opening the PORVs. 
NUREG-0737 and NUREG-0660 issued the requirements. 
The applicant stated in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that it considers Issue II.K.3(9) resolved by the
establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance.
The applicant addressed this issue in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.1, Item II.K.3(9), where it
stated that this issue is not applicable to the AP1000 design because the design does not have
PORVs.  DCD Tier 2, Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.2, provide additional information.
On the basis of the staff’s review, Issue II.K.3(9) is resolved for the AP1000 design. 
Issue II.K.3(18):  Modification of ADS Logic—Feasibility Study and Modification for Increased
Diversity for Some Event Sequences
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(18) addresses requiring BWR plants to modify the
ADS actuation logic to eliminate the need for manual actuation to assure adequate core
cooling.  NUREG-0737 and NUREG-0660 issued the requirements for a feasibility study and
risk assessment study to determine the optimum approach.
The applicant does not address this issue in Section 1.9.4.2.1 but indicated in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that the establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance resolves
this issue.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(vii), the applicant stated that although this
issue is identified as applicable to BWRs only, it is applicable to the AP1000 design because
the design uses an ADS with some similarity to that used on BWRs.  The ADS automatically
actuates on Low-1 CMT level, coincident with a CMT actuation signal. The applicant stated that
manual actuation of the ADS is not required to maintain core cooling.  As discussed under
Issue II.B.8 in this section regarding degraded core accidents, the AP1000 PRA analysis
confirms the use of the reliability of the automatic ADS actuation.  The reliability of the
automatic ADS actuation is incorporated throughout the PRA analysis. The staff evaluates this
reliability in Section 19.1 of this report.
The actuation of ADS Stages 2 and 3 occurs on a set time delay after the actuation of the first
stage, as discussed above.  Stage 4 of the ADS actuates on a Low-2 CMT level.  Therefore,
the staff agrees that manual actuation of the ADS is not required to maintain core cooling.
Generic Issues
20-104
On the basis of the staff’s review of the ADS design discussed in Section 6.3 of this report,
Issue II.K.3(18) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(25):  Effect of Loss of AC Power on Pump Seals  
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(25) requires licensees to determine, on a
plant-specific basis, the consequences of a loss of cooling water to the RCP seal coolers.  The
demonstrated adequacy of the seal design to withstand a LOOP should prevent excessive loss
of RCS inventory following an anticipated operational occurrence.  NUREG-0737 requires that
the consequences of a loss of cooling water to the pump seal coolers be determined and that
the pump seals should be designed to withstand a complete LOOP for at least 2 hours. 
The applicant does not address this issue in Section 1.9.4.2.1 but indicated in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that the establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance resolves
this issue.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(iii), the applicant stated that the AP1000
design uses canned-motor RCP pumps.  The canned-motor pump design does not have a seal
that can fail and initiate RCS leakage.
The staff determined that Issue 23, which is discussed in Section 20.3 of this report, covers this
issue.  On the basis of the approved resolution of Issue 23 for the AP1000 design in
Section 20.3 of this report, Issue II.K.3(25) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(28):  Study and Verify Qualification of Accumulators on ADS Valves
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(28) addresses requiring assurance from BWR
licensees that air or nitrogen accumulators for ADS valves had sufficient capacity to cycle the
valves open five times at design pressure.  NUREG-0737 and NUREG-0660 issued the
requirements.
The applicant does not address this issue in Section 1.9.4.2.1 but indicated in DCD Tier 2,
Table 1.9-2, that the establishment of new regulatory requirements and/or guidance resolves
this issue.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (1)(x), the applicant stated that although this
issue is identified as applicable to BWRs only, the AP1000 uses a safety-related ADS that
differs from that presently used on BWRs.  The AP1000 ADS uses safety-related dc
motor-operated valves and squib valves to initiate depressurization.  The motive power for
these valves is safety-related dc power.  The operation of these valves does not rely on
non-safety-related equipment or instrumentation, including instrument air or nitrogen supply. 
These valves are designed and qualified to function in the conditions of an accident, they will be
subject to preoperational and inservice testing, and they will be part of the RAP.  On the basis
of the staff’s review, Issue II.K.3(28) is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue II.K.3(30):  Revised Small-Break LOCA Methods to Show Compliance with 10 CFR
Part 50,  Appendix K
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue II.K.3(30) requires licensees to revise and submit
analytical methods for SBLOCA analyses for compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K, for
NRC review and approval.  The revised LOCA methods were to account for comparisons with
experimental data, including data from LOFT and Semiscale test facilities.  Alternatively,
Generic Issues
20-105
licensees were to provide additional justification for the acceptability of their SBLOCA models
with LOFT and Semiscale test data.  NUREG-0737 contained clarifications.
DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, indicates that this issue is not an AP1000 DC issue because the issue
applies to currently operating plants or is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is COL
Action Item 20.1.4-1.
The AP1000 SBLOCA analysis is performed with the NOTRUMP computer code.  The applicant
developed NOTRUMP to better address the thermal-hydraulic aspects of SBLOCA, which had
become an issue following the accident at TMI.  The staff reviewed the applicant’s NOTRUMP
code, including comparisons with experimental data, and documented its finding in Chapters 15
and 21 of this report.  On the basis of this review, Issue II.K.3(30) is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue III.A.1.2:  Upgrade Licensee Emergency Support Facilities
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue III.A.1.2 addresses requiring licensees to upgrade their
emergency support facilities by establishing a TSC, an operational support center (OSC), and a
near-site emergency operations facility (EOF) for command and control, support, and
coordination of onsite and offsite functions during reactor accident situations.  NUREG-0737,
and “Supplement 1 to NUREG-0737, Requirements for Emergency Response Capability,
(GL 82-33),” dated December 17, 1982, resolved this issue and issued new requirements.
The applicant indicated, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that it considers Issue III.A.1.2 relevant to
the AP1000 design.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xxv), the applicant stated that the
AP1000 design provides for an onsite TSC and onsite OSC, which are discussed in DCD
Tier 2, Chapter 18, and that the offsite emergency response facility is the responsibility of the
COL applicant.  In DCD Tier 2, Sections 18.8.3.5 and 18.8.3.6 described the mission, major
tasks, and location of the TSC and OSC for the AP1000 standard design.  Figures 1.2-19 and
1.2-18 show the location of the TSC and OSC, respectively.  The applicant stated in DCD
Tier 2, Section 13.3, that emergency planning is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is
reflected in Section 13.3.2 of this report as COL Action Item 13.3-1.
Additionally, as discussed in Section 13.3.3 of this report, the standard design must consider
certain features, facilities, functions, and equipment necessary for emergency planning. 
Specifically, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xxv), the standard design must address the
characteristics of the onsite TSC and OSC.  The staff’s review documented two open items
(13.3-1 and 13.3-2) associated with the AP1000 emergency support facilities in the DSER. 
These open items are now resolved.  Therefore, the staff concludes that, based on the
evaluation in Section 13.3.3 of this report, and specifically the resolution of the open items
noted above, Issue III.A.1.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue III.A.3.3:  Install Direct Dedicated Telephone Lines and Obtain Dedicated Short-Range
Radio Communication Systems
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue III.A.3.3 addresses the need for licensees to upgrade their
communications capability at the emergency support facilities at the plant listed in
Issue III.A.1.2.  NUREG-0660 contains relevant guidance.
Generic Issues
20-106
DCD Tier 2, Section 13.3, states that emergency planning, including communication interfaces
among the MCR, the TSC, and the emergency planning centers, is the responsibility of the COL
applicant.  Further, the COL applicant referencing the AP1000 certified design will address
emergency planning, including post-72-hour actions and communications interface.  DCD
Tier 2, Section 9.5.2, provides that COL applicants referencing the AP1000 certified design will
address interfaces to required offsite locations.  The COL applicant will also address the
emergency response facility communication system, including the crisis management radio
system.
The staff considers this issue to be outside the scope of the AP1000 DC and, therefore, the
COL applicant will address it.  DCD Tier 2, Section 13.3, addresses this issue and
Section 13.3.2 of this report discusses it as COL Action Item 13.3.-1.  Therefore, Issue III.A.3.3
is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue III.D.1.1:  Primary Coolant Sources Outside the Containment Structure
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue III.D.1.1 addresses the requirement that licensees identify
design features to reduce the potential for exposure to workers at plants and to offsite
populations from the release of primary coolant following an accident.  This issue has three
subissues:
(1)
III.D.1.1(1), “Review Information Submitted by Licensees Pertaining to Reducing
Leakage from Operating Plants”
(2)
III.D.1.1(2), “Review Information on Provisions for Leak Detection”
(3)
III.D.1.1(3), “Develop Proposed System Acceptance Criteria”
In NUREG-0737, Subissue III.D.1.1(1) required licensees to implement a program to reduce
leakage from systems outside the containment that would or could contain highly radioactive
fluids during a serious transient, or following an accident, to as-low-as-practical levels.  
For Subissue III.D.1.1(2), the staff also stated in NUREG-0933 that Issue II.F.1 addressed
accident monitoring instrumentation and that the RCPB leak detection capability must be
equivalent to that specified in RG 1.45.  This section addresses Issue II.F.1 for the AP1000
design.
The staff reviewed the need for requiring leak detection systems and the development of new
acceptance criteria for those systems encompassed by Subissue III.D.1.1(3) as part of other
issues, as described in Subissue III.D.1.1(2).  Therefore, work on Subissue III.D.1.1(3) did not
provide any data for staff consideration, and the staff dropped this issue from further
consideration.  
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xxvi), the applicant stated that the safety-related passive
systems for the AP1000 design do not recirculate radioactive fluids outside the containment
following an accident.  A non-safety-related system can be used to recirculate coolant outside
of containment following an accident, but this system is not operated when radiation levels are
high within the containment.  On the basis of the staff’s review, Issue III.D.1.1 is resolved for the
AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-107
Issue III.D.3.3:  In-Plant Radiation Monitoring
As stated in 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xxvii) (III.D.3.3), the licensee shall “provide for monitoring of in-
plant radiation and airborne radioactivity as appropriate for a broad range of routine and
accident conditions.”
Area and airborne radiation monitors at the AP1000 will supplement the personnel and area
radiation survey provisions of the AP1000 health physics program described in DCD Tier 2,
Section 12.5.  These area and airborne radiation monitors, which are described in DCD Tier 2,
Section 11.5, will comply with the personnel radiation protection guidelines of 10 CFR Part 20,
10 CFR Part 50, 10 CFR Part 70, and RGs 1.97, 8.2, “Guide for Administrative Practices in
Radiation Monitoring,” 8.8, “Information Relevant to Ensuring that Occupation Radiation
Exposures at Nuclear Power Station Will Be As Low As Is Reasonably Achievable.”
In addition, NUREG-0737, Item III.D.3.3, states that “each licensee shall provide equipment and
associated training and procedures for accurately determining the airborne iodine concentration
in areas within the facility where plant personnel may be present during an accident.”  Effective
monitoring of increasing iodine levels in the buildings under accident conditions must include
the use of portable instruments.  Because the description of portable instrumentation, training,
and procedures is outside the scope of DCD Tier 2, the applicant addressed this as a COL
item.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 12.3.5, the applicant stated that the COL applicant will address the
criteria and methods for obtaining representative measurements of radiological conditions,
including airborne radioactivity in work areas.  In addition, the COL applicant will address the
use of portable instruments and the associated training and procedures to accurately determine
the airborne iodine concentrations in areas within the facility where plant personnel may be
present during an accident.  This is COL Action Item 12.4.4-1.
The information on in-plant radiation monitoring in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 12, addresses the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.34(f)(2)(xxvii) (III.D.3.3), and the staff’s concerns in this area are
resolved.  Therefore, Issue III.D.3.3 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue III.D.3.4:  Control Room Habitability
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue III.D.3.4 addresses upgrading the habitability of the
control room for the operators.  NUREG-0737 provided the requirements.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.3, Item (2)(xxviii), the applicant stated that normally a
non-safety-related HVAC system keeps the AP1000 MCR slightly pressurized to prevent
infiltration of air from other plant areas.  During accident conditions, safety-related isolation of
the MCR is automatically actuated.  Upon the loss of non-safety-related ac power, the MCR
environment is sufficient to protect the operators and support the man-machine interfaces
necessary to establish and maintain safe shutdown conditions for the plant following postulated
DBA conditions.  
The applicant stated that MCR is to be sealed with safety-related connections to a
safety-related compressed air breathing source.  This compressed air system provides
continued pressurization and a source of fresh air for operator habitability.  The air supply is
Generic Issues
20-108
sized to last for 72 hours following an accident.  The onsite non-safety-related normal HVAC
system will be operational before the installed compressed air supply is exhausted.
The applicant also stated that the non-safety-related HVAC system, equipped with a
refrigeration-type air conditioning unit and powered from the onsite DGs, normally provides
MCR cooling.  If the normal HVAC system is not available, outside air is not allowed into the
MCR, and the safety-related compressed air storage system is actuated.
In a letter dated May 21, 2003, the applicant committed to conform to the guidance of RG 1.78,
Revision 1, to meet the requirements of TMI Action Plan Item III.D.3.4 and GDC 19.  In
addition, the applicant agreed to revise the DCD to refer to RG 1.78, Revision 1.  Confirmatory
Item 6.4-1 in the DSER identified the need for inclusion of this information in the DCD.  The
staff has reviewed the DCD and concludes that it appropriately refers to RG 1.78, Revision 1. 
Therefore, Confirmatory Item 6.4-1 is resolved.
DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.7, states that the COL applicant referencing the AP1000 certified
design is responsible for the amount and location of possible sources of toxic chemicals in or
near the plant and for seismic Category I, Class 1E toxic gas monitoring, as required.  It also
states that RG 1.78, Revision 1, addresses control room protection for toxic chemicals and
evaluation of offsite toxic releases (including the potential for toxic releases beyond 72 hours) in
order to meet the requirements of TMI Action Plan Item III.D.3.4 and GDC 19.  This is COL
Action Item 6.4-1.
The applicant submitted the results of radiological consequence analyses for personnel in the
MCR during a DBA in DCD Tier 2, Section 6.4.4.  DCD Tier 2, Section 15.6.5.3, detailed the
analysis assumptions for modeling the doses to MCR personnel.  Open Item 6.4-1 in the DSER,
identified that the staff could not complete its review and independent dose assessment until it
had resolved questions on the assumed aerosol removal rates in the containment.
In Section 6.4 of this report, the staff resolved Open Item 6.4-1 and found that the VES, under
“high-high” radiation conditions as described in the AP1000 DCD Section 6.4, is capable of
mitigating the dose in MCR following DBAs to meet the dose criteria specified in GDC 19 as
applied to the AP1000 design.
Therefore, Issue III.D.3.4 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
20.5  Human Factors Issues
Issue HF1.1:  Shift Staffing
This issue addresses ensuring that the numbers and capabilities of the staff at nuclear power
plants are adequate to operate the plant safely.  This issue was to determine the minimum
appropriate shift crew staffing composition.  To meet this goal, an applicant must consider the
number and functions of the staff needed to safely perform all required plant operations,
maintenance, and technical support for each operational mode; the minimum qualifications of
plant personnel in terms of education, skill, knowledge, training experience, and fitness for duty;
and appropriate limits and conditions for shift work including overtime, shift duration, and shift
rotation.  
Generic Issues
20-109
The review criteria for this issue appear in 10 CFR 50.54, SRP Sections 13.1.2–13.1.3,
“Operating Organization,” and RG 1.114, “Guidance to Operators at the Controls and to Senior
Operators in the Control Room of a Nuclear Power Unit.”  The applicant does not address this
issue in DCD Tier 2.  It concludes, in DCD Tier 2, Table 1.9-2, that this issue is not relevant to
the AP1000 design because it is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is COL Action
Item 20.1.4-1.  As indicated earlier in this report in Section 18.3, the applicant satisfactorily
addressed this item in WCAP-14645.  Therefore, Issue HF1.1 is resolved for the AP1000
design.
Issue HF4.1:  Inspection Procedure for Upgraded Emergency Operating Procedures
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue HF4.1 addresses the development of criteria by the NRC
to provide assurance during inspections that operating plant EOPs are adequate and can be
used effectively.  The staff published lessons learned from its inspections of EOPs at plants in
NUREG-1358, “Lessons Learned from the Special Inspection Program for Emergency
Operating Procedures,” April 1989.  The NRC later issued Temporary Instruction (TI) 2515/92,
“Emergency Operating Procedures Team Inspections,” containing guidance for conducting
these inspections.  
The issue was resolved with no new requirements.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, the applicant
stated that the design of the AP1000 EOPs is consistent with NUREG-1358 and its
supplements, as well as current regulatory guidance and standards.  DCD Tier 2, Section 18.9,
has additional information.  DCD Tier 2, Section 18.9, “Procedure Development,” covers this
issue, which is a COL responsibility.  This is COL Action Item 13.5-1.  Therefore, Issue HF4.1 is
resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue HF4.4:  Guidelines for Upgrading Other Procedures
 
As discussed in NUREG-0933, this issue addresses efforts by the staff to evaluate the quality
of, and the problems associated with, existing plant procedures to ensure that plant procedures
(other than EOPs which are discussed in Issue HF4.1 above) are adequate and effective, and
to guide operators in maintaining plants in a safe state under all operating conditions.  The NRC
was to evaluate the need to develop technical guidance for use by industry in upgrading normal
and abnormal operating procedures.  To satisfy the objective of this issue, an applicant must
(1) develop guidelines for preparing and criteria for evaluating normal operating procedures and
other procedures that affect plant safety and (2) upgrade the procedures, train the operators in
their use, and implement the upgraded procedures.  
The review criteria for this issue appear in SRP Sections 13.5.1, “Administration Procedures,”
and 13.5.2, “Operating and Maintenance Procedures,” and in Information Notice (IN) 86-64,
“Deficiencies in Upgrade Programs for Plant Emergency Operating Procedures.”  In addition,
Element 8, “Procedures Development,” of NUREG-0711, “Human Factors Engineering Program
Review Model” covers this item.
As indicated in Section 18.3 of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645, and the staff has concluded that WCAP-14645 is applicable to AP1000 design. 
On the basis of the staff’s review, Issue HF4.4 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Generic Issues
20-110
Issue HF5.1:  Local Control Stations
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue HF5.1 addresses assuring that the man-machine interface
at local control stations and auxiliary operator interfaces is adequate for the safe operation and
maintenance of a nuclear power plant.  The concerns associated with this issue include the
assurance that indications and controls available to operators at local control stations outside of
the control room and remote shutdown room are sufficient and appropriate for their intended
use.  The regulatory guidance has been limited to the control room and the remote shutdown
panel.  Control room crew activities should be analyzed to establish and describe
communication and control links between the control room and the auxiliary control stations. 
Additionally, the potential impact of auxiliary personnel on plant safety should be analyzed.  
This issue was resolved and no new requirements were established.  In DCD Tier 2,
Section 1.9.4.2.4, the applicant stated that it has used techniques and experience gained in the
design of the MCR and remote shutdown panel on the local control station panels.  The
methodology for analyzing the job/tasks of the control room is applied to the analysis of
job/tasks of auxiliary personnel to identify and describe communication and action links
between the control room and the auxiliary control stations.  As indicated in Section 18.3 of this
report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in WCAP-14645.  Therefore, Issue HF5.1
is resolved for the AP1000 design.
Issue HF5.2:  Review Criteria for Human Factors Aspects of Advanced Controls and
Instrumentation
As discussed in NUREG-0933, Issue HF5.2 addresses the use of advanced I&Cs, in particular
with respect to plant annunciators.  The then-existing human engineering guidelines for control
rooms addressed the control, display, and information concepts and technologies that were
being used in process control systems.  The NRC did not believe these guidelines would be
adequate for advanced and developing technologies that could be introduced into future
designs.  The agency expected that improved alarm systems using advanced technologies
would become available, and regulators would develop guidelines for the use and evaluation of
these longer term alarm improvements.  
This issue focused on the potential risk that could result from the human error in the use of
control room alarms.  The staff stopped work on this issue when the Office of Nuclear
Regulatory Research (RES) integrated the development of review guidance for advanced
alarms into its program to develop an “Advanced Human-Interface Design Review Guideline.”
This issue is resolved with no new requirements.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4.2.4, the
applicant stated that the AP1000 advanced alarm design, described in DCD Tier 2,
Section 18.9.2, conforms with current guidance and requirements for integrated human factors
design.  WCAP-14690 describes the computerized procedures, and DCD Tier 2,
Section 18.8.3.2, gives a detailed description of the QDPS.  DCD Tier 2, Section 18.8.2.3,
contains the plan for the V&V of the AP1000 man-machine interface system (M-MIS).
The applicant identified and discussed the “current guidance and requirements on integrated
human factors design” it used to design the advanced alarm system for the AP1000 design. 
The applicant also explained the relationship of the computerized procedures and QDPS.  As
Generic Issues

indicated in Section 18.3 of this report, the applicant satisfactorily addressed this item in
WCAP-14645.  Therefore, Issue HF5.2 is resolved for the AP1000 design.
20.6  Three Mile Island Action Plan Requirements
Pursuant to 10 CFR 52.47(a)(ii), an applicant for DC must demonstrate compliance with any
technically relevant TMI requirements in 10 CFR 50.34(f).  Table 20.6-1 of this report lists the
relevant TMI Action Plan items, the 10 CFR 50.34(f) requirements, and the section in which

20.7  Incorporation of Operating Experience
20.7.1  Background
As part of its program to disseminate information on operational reactor experience to the
nuclear industry, the NRC issues generic communications (BLs, GLs, and INs) when it believes
a significant safety-related event or condition at one or more facilities  potentially applies to
other facilities.  The NRC staff typically issues a BL or GL when it determines that licensees
should be required to inform the NRC what actions they have taken or will take to address an
event, condition, or circumstance that is both potentially significant to safety and generic.  The
staff typically issues an IN when it determines that licensees should be informed of an event,
condition, or circumstance that is both potentially significant to safety and generic, but the
event, condition, or circumstance is not sufficiently significant to warrant requiring licensees to
confirm their actions in writing.  Potential safety issues highlighted in NRC generic
communications have resulted in the establishment of a USI or a GSI, and have also been
incorporated into formal regulatory requirements.
Generic Issues
20-113
The Commission requested, in its SRMs dated July 31, 1989, and February 15 and
March 5, 1991, that an applicant submitting plant designs for standard plant DC discuss how it
has incorporated operating experience into the design.
The staff examined the AP1000 design for incorporation of important lessons learned from
operating plant experience by reviewing the BLs and GLs issued between January 1, 1980, and
January 31, 2002, and determining whether the applicant had properly incorporated into the
AP1000 design the staff positions in those documents that were applicable.  In the NRC
programs that account for operating experience, the BLs and GLs issued to the nuclear industry
convey the most safety-significant lessons distilled from numerous sources of information on
operating plant malfunctions (e.g., licensee event reports (LERs)), issue staff positions on
resolving problems in these malfunctions, and request licensee actions.  In contrast, INs do not
request actions on the part of the licensees.  Thus, reviewing how the applicant has
incorporated pertinent BLs and GLs into the AP1000 design is a sufficient basis for reviewing
the design against operating experience.
In the resolution of BLs and GLs for the AP1000 design, the staff looked beyond the specific
purpose of the documents to determine their resolution for the AP1000 design.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 1.9.5.5 states that the applicability of each GL and BL to the AP1000 is assessed in
WCAP-15800.  WCAP-15800 states that BLs and GLs identified as procurement, procedural, or
maintenance/surveillance Issues will be reviewed and addressed by the COL applicant.  Items
identified as part of COL are also part of this action item.  This is COL Action Item 20.7.1-1.
20.7.2  Application Content Review
The applicant submitted DCD Tier 2 for standard plant DC of the AP1000 design.  In that
document, the applicant stated that the design engineers continually review industry experience
from sources such as NRC BLs, LERs, NRC requests for information, and GLs.  The applicant
also stated that it has incorporated operating plant experience in the AP1000 design by virtue of
its participation in developing Volume III of the EPRI ALWR URD and in the activities of the
ALWR Utility Steering Committee.
The applicant also submitted WCAP-15800 to address the manner in which it incorporated
operating plant experience into the AP1000 design and stated that it had reviewed the NRC
BLs, GLs, circulars, INs, and AEOD reports for the period January 1, 1980, to January 31,
2002.  The applicant discussed the applicability of these NRC documents to the AP1000 design
by referring to the appropriate DCD Tier 2 sections or explaining that the AP1000 design does
not have the equipment discussed in the NRC document.  The individual documents were
separated into the following categories:

not applicable to the AP1000 design (e.g., BWR only, B&W or CE facilities only, or not
applicable to commercial reactors)

not applicable for other reason (e.g., procurement issue, administrative communication,
procedural issue, maintenance or surveillance issue, plant-specific or isolated event)

applicable to AP1000 DC
Generic Issues
20-114
The staff considered the applicant’s list of BLs and GLs applicable to the AP1000 design in
determining its own list of documents to review in examining how the applicant incorporated
operating experience in the design.
20.7.2.1  Regulatory Review
The SRP (NUREG-0800) guides the NRC staff in its review of a reactor facility design.  This
document states requirements, acceptance criteria (some of which the NRC predicates on
operating reactor experience), and findings that the staff must make.  The NRC last revised this
document in April 1982, when it incorporated significant issues raised before January 1981. 
Accordingly, the staff concludes that it is appropriate to focus its review on issues of operating
experience identified by the NRC since January 1980.  As stated above, the applicant reviewed
and reported on the applicability to the AP1000 design of the BLs and GLs issued by the NRC
between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2002.
As discussed in Section 20.7.1 above, the BLs and GLs address issues of sufficient safety
significance to warrant requiring licensees to inform the NRC of the actions they have taken or
will take, whereas INs do not require a response.  Accordingly, the NRC staff reviewed the BLs
and GLs issued between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2002, applicable to the AP1000
design. 
Upon initial review, the NRC excluded certain BLs and GLs from further examination because
they were not relevant to the design of the AP1000 plant, or because they were associated with
TMI Action Plan items, USIs, or GSIs, or existing rules and regulations and, thus, were already
an integral part of the staff’s AP1000 design review process.  
Sections 20.2 through 20.4 of this report discuss the resolution of the technically relevant
generic issues in NUREG-0933 (i.e., TMI Action Plan items, USIs, and GSIs) for the AP1000
design.  Tables 20.7-1 and 20.7-2 of this report summarize the resolution of the issues in BLs
and GLs, respectively.
20.7.4  Conclusions
The staff selected certain BLs and GLs issued by the NRC between January 1, 1980, and
January 31, 2002, for use in its review of the AP1000 design because the issues involved in
these documents were not already required by rule, regulation, or policy statement.  By NRC
letter dated September 2, 1995, the staff listed generic issues (i.e., BLs and GLs) no longer
relevant to the AP600 design.  The review of these issues duplicate other staff reviews and,
therefore were unnecessary for the FSER review of the AP600 design.  The staff has reviewed
these issues and considers them unnecessary for the FSER review of the AP1000 design. 
Therefore, the following will not be included in the tables:  
BL 80-02, BL 80-03, BL 80-16, BL 86-02, BL 88-03.
GL 80-13, GL 80-16, GL 80-30, GL 80-45, GL 80-48, GL 80-53, GL 80-56, GL 80-82,

Tables 20.7-1 and 20.7-2 of this report list these BLs and GLs.
On the basis of its review of the BLs and GLs issued between January 1, 1980, and
January 31, 2002, and the applicant’s report (WCAP-15800) on how these BLs and GLs apply
to the AP1000 design, the staff concludes that the applicant has adequately addressed the
incorporation of operational data into the AP1000 design, except as noted in this report.

BL 80-01,
Operability of ADS
Valve Pneumatic
Supply
The NRC issued this BL only to BWR licensees to determine the
operability of the pneumatic operator for the ADS; however, the
AP1000 design has an ADS similar to that in BWRs.  In
WCAP-15800, Revision 3, the applicant stated that the AP1000
design uses a safety-related ADS that differs from that presently
used on BWRs. The AP1000 ADS uses safety-related dc MOVs and
squib valves to initiate depressurization.  The motive power for these
valves is safety-related dc power.  The operation of these valves
does not rely on any non-safety-related equipment or
instrumentation, including instrument air or nitrogen supply.  These
valves are designed and qualified to function in the conditions of an
accident.  They will also be the subject of preoperational and
inservice testing, and they will be part of the RAP.
Based on the foregoing, this BL is not applicable to the AP1000
design.

BL 80-04, Analysis
of a Pressurized-
Water Reactor
(PWR) Main
Steamline Break
with Continued
Feedwater Addition
The staff considered this BL in its review of DCD Tier 2,
Sections 15.1.5 and 6.2.1.4, on mass and energy release analysis for
a postulated pipe rupture inside containment.
This BL asks addressees to review their containment pressure and
temperature response analysis to determine if the MSLB accident
inside containment included the impact of runout flow from the AFW
and the impact of other energy sources, such as continuation of
feedwater or condensate flow.  It also asks addressees to consider
the ability to detect and isolate the damaged SG from these sources.
In DCD Tier 2, Sections 6.2.1.4.1.3 and 6.2.1.4.3.2, the applicant
indicated that the effects of startup feedwater flow are maximized in
the MSLB mass and energy release by assuming maximum (runout)
startup feedwater flow to a fully depressurized SG starting from the
safeguard system signal or low SG level reactor trip and continuing
until automatically terminated. 
Regarding normal feedwater, the applicant indicated in DCD Tier 2,
Section 6.2.1.4.1.2, that the unisolated feedwater line volumes
between the SG and isolation valves have been accounted for in the
mass and energy release.  The feedwater flow rates are based on
steam and main feed system design.  Feedwater is isolated on a
containment pressure signal.
Because normal and startup feedwater addition have been
maximized and because the AP1000 has means to automatically
isolate feedwater flow, the staff finds that the licensee has
adequately addressed the containment-related issues in BL 80-04. 
Therefore, the containment-related aspects of BL 80-04 are resolved. 
The other aspect of the feedwater addition issue addressed by this
bulletin, namely the reactivity addition that would occur as a result of
a MSLB, is addressed in Section 15.2.1.5 of this report.  The
reactivity-related aspects of this BL are considered resolved based
on the staff’s acceptance of the analyses provided in DCD Tier 2,
Section 15.1.5.
Based on the staff’s review, this BL is resolved for the AP1000
design.

BL 80-05, Vacuum
Condition Resulting
in Damage To
Chemical Volume
Control System
(CVCS) Holdup
Tanks
This BL addresses the issues concerning the release of radioactive
material or other adverse effects as a result of low vacuum conditions
causing tank buckling.  The low-vacuum condition is created by the
cooling of hot water in a low-pressure tank.  NUREG-1512, “Final
Safety Evaluation Report Related to Certification of the AP600
Standard Design,” adequately addresses the concern identified in
BL 80-05.  The bases for the finding are that (1) except for the
reactor coolant drain tank (RCDT) located in the containment
building, no other tank in the WLS is exposed to hot water, and
(2) the RCDT has several design features, including an external
design pressure of 15 psig, which eliminate the possibility of
structural collapse of the RCDT resulting from steam condensation. 
Because of these design features, the RCDT will not collapse even if
it is exposed to a full vacuum.  The staff noted that all of the WLS
tanks have vents that are adequately sized to prevent tank collapse
during draindown.  DCD Tier 2, Table 11.2-2, shows that the external
design pressure for the RCDT of the AP1000 design is 15 psig.  The
staff confirmed in Section 11.2 of this report that the above bases for
the finding in NUREG-1512 are applicable to the AP1000.  Therefore,
the staff finds that the design of the WLS of the AP1000 as
discussed adequately addresses the concern identified in BL 80-05
and, therefore, is acceptable.  
Based on the staff’s review, this BL is resolved for the AP1000.
BL 80-06, 
Engineered Safety
Feature Reset
Controls
Westinghouse stated in WCAP-15800, Revision 3, that it addressed
this BL in DCD Tier 2, Sections 7.3.1.1, 13.5, and Chapter 14.  This
BL lists two actions that apply to the AP1000 design—(1) review the
I&C system schematics to verify that the ESF equipment remains in
its emergency mode upon reset of the ESF actuation signal, and
(2) verify that the as-built I&C system configuration conforms with
schematics.  For the AP1000 design, resetting the ESF signal does
not reposition any ESF equipment.  Verification of the as-built I&C
system is the responsibility of the COL applicant during the plant
preoperational tests.  This is part of COL Action Item 20.7.1-1.
Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.
BL 80-08, 
Examination of

Environment
This BL describes an event caused by the use of a temporary heating
hose, which resulted in contamination of a nonradioactive system
and an unmonitored, uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the
environment.  
In DCD Tier 2, Section 9.3.5, the applicant stated that there are no
permanent connections between the radioactive waste drain system
(WRS) and nonradioactive piping.  However, the design includes
provisions for temporary diversion of contaminated water from
normally nonradioactive drains to the WLS.  Therefore, the WRS is
designed to prevent the inadvertent transfer of contaminated fluids to
a noncontaminated drainage system for disposal.  WCAP-15800,
Revision 3, states that this BL is not applicable to the AP1000 design
certification and is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is
COL Action Item 20.7.1-1.
The staff believes that such an event is not caused by poor system
design but by poor system operation and maintenance programs. 
Therefore, the staff agrees with the applicant that the COL applicant
should address this event in its plant operating and maintenance
procedures.  
Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.
BL 80-11, Masonry
Wall Design
As stated in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.8.4.6.1.4, there are no safety-
related masonry walls used in the nuclear island.  Also, in
WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse stated that this BL is not
applicable to the AP1000 design because the design has no
safety-related masonry walls.  
The staff agrees that the AP1000 has no safety-related masonry
walls.  Based on the foregoing, this BL is not applicable to the
AP1000 design.
BL 80-12, Decay
Heat Removal
Operability
This BL deals with reducing the likelihood of losing the decay heat
removal capability in operating PWRs.  In WCAP-15800, Revision 3,
the applicant stated that DCD Section 7.4.1 addresses this BL.
The AP1000 design relies on the passive RHR system for decay heat
removal.  For defense-in-depth considerations, the AP1000 design
relies on the normal residual heat removal system (RNS) and
associated procedures to reduce the shutdown mode risks. 
Sections 6.3 and 19.3 of this report discuss the staff evaluations of
the PRHR capability and the shutdown risks involving RNS,
respectively.  Based on the staff’s review, this BL is resolved for the
AP1000 design.

BL 80-15, Possible
Loss of Emergency
Notification System
(ENS) with Loss of
Offsite Power
BL 80-15 directs licensees to take various emergency notification
system (ENS) inspection and testing actions, including preparing an
administrative procedure and making necessary modifications to
ensure that the ENS does not fail upon loss of either onsite or offsite
power.  In DCD Tier 2, Section 8.2.5, “Combined License Information
for Offsite Electrical Power”, the applicant stated that “Combined
License applicants referencing the AP1000 certified design will
address the design of the ac power transmission system and its
testing and inspection.”
DCD Tier 2, Section 13.3, “Emergency Planning”, states that
emergency planning, including communication interfaces among the
MCR, the TSC, and the emergency planning centers, are the
responsibility of the COL applicant.  Further, the COL applicant
referencing the AP1000 certified design will address emergency
planning, including post-72-hour actions and communications
interface.  DCD Tier 2, Section 9.5.2, “Communication System”,
provides that COL applicants referencing the AP1000 certified design
will address interfaces to required offsite locations.  The COL
applicant will also address the emergency response facility
communication system, including the crisis management radio
system (DCD Tier 2, Section 9.5.2.5).
Since the ENS is an offsite emergency communications interface with
the NRC, and communication system and interfaces (including the
design, inspection and testing of the electric power systems) are the
responsibility of the COL applicant, the staff finds that BL 80-15 is not
applicable to the AP1000 design certification.  The reminder to the
COL applicant to review this BL for recommendations related to loss
of either onsite or offsite power, and a consequential loss of the ENS,
is COL Action Item 20.7.4-1.
Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.

Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.
BL 80-24, 
Prevention of
Damage Due to
Water Leakage
Inside Containment
BL 80-24 defines an open system as one that utilizes an indefinite
volume, such as a river, so that leakage from the system could not
be detected by inventory decrease.  The applicant stated that there
are no open systems in the AP1000 containment.
Cooling water for the AP1000 design is supplied by closed systems,
including the CCW system (DCD Tier 2, Section 9.2.2) and the
chilled water system (DCD Tier 2, Section 9.2.7).  Fire protection
water used inside containment is stored in the passive containment
cooling water storage tank (PCCWST) and is isolated by CIVs during
operation.  Water level in the PCCWST is alarmed in the MCR, and
excessive flow from the tank can be terminated.
Monitoring containment sump level is a key part of AP1000 leakage
detection, which ensures detection of an increasing sump water level. 
DCD Tier 2, Section 5.2.5, describes leakage detection, and DCD
Tier 2, Section 3.4.1.2.2.1, addresses containment flooding events.

Snubbers
The staff’s review of the resolution comment for this item in
WCAP-15800, Revision 0, found that the reference to DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.9.6, did not provide the appropriate discussion for
resolution of this issue.  DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.6, addresses only
IST of pumps and valves and does not include any information on
mechanical snubbers.  The staff recognizes that BL 81-01 deals with
examinations of snubbers installed in operating plants, and this
aspect of the BL is not applicable to the AP1000 DC.  However, the
staff position is that the applicant should address the surveillance
testing implications of this BL during the DC process.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.9.6, does not provide this information.  The staff requested
in RAI 210.068 that the applicant provide additional discussion of
surveillance and testing of dynamic restraints (i.e., snubbers) used in
the AP1000 design.
In response to RAI 210.068, the applicant referenced DCD Tier 2,
Section 3.9.3.4.3, for the discussion of requirements for the
production and qualification of hydraulic snubbers.  Additionally, DCD
Tier 2, Section 5.2.4, states that ISI and testing of Class 1
components, including snubbers used as supports, are performed in
accordance with Section XI of the ASME Code.  ASME Code,
Section XI, references the ANSI/ASME OM Part 4 standard for IST of
snubbers.  DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.8.3, states the requirement for
the COL applicant to develop a program to verify the operability of
snubbers utilized in the AP1000 design.  This is COL Action
Item 3.9.8-1.
In Revision 3 of DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.3.4.3, the applicant added
specific references to the ASME OM Code used to develop the IST
plan for the AP1000 DC, and to Section XI of the ASME Code for
performance of inservice inspection.  WCAP-15800, Revision 3,
provides appropriate references to DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.3.4.3,
and to ASME Code, Section XI, for information addressing snubber
surveillance testing.  The staff’s review of this information concludes
that the changes in Revision 1 of the WCAP adequately address this
issue and provide an acceptable resolution for this BL by ensuring
the establishment of programs for qualification testing of snubbers
and inservice examination and functional testing of snubbers.  Based
on the staff’s review, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.

systems.  It asks licensees to provide specific information concerning
their programs for monitoring the wall thickness of pipes in
condensate, feedwater, steam, and connected high-energy piping
systems, including all safety-related and non-safety-related piping
systems fabricated of carbon steel.  DCD Tier 2, Section 5.4.3.4,
pertains to RCS piping which is fabricated from stainless steel and,
therefore, is not addressed by BL 87-01.  DCD Tier 2, Section 10.1.2,

the Applicant
Reactors
The staff reviewed the description of the design of the AP1000
thimble tubes given in DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.7.2.  The AP1000
thimble tubes have enhanced resistance to flow-induced vibration
and wear.  The thimble tube is structurally stiffer than the design in
previous operating plants, utilizes wear-resistant materials, and
features a smaller gap between the thimble tube and the thimble
guide tube to further minimize vibration.  The double-wall design of
the thimble tube assembly also precludes a nonisolable leak of
reactor coolant.  The staff’s review concludes that the enhanced
design of the AP1000 in-core instrumentation thimble tubes
adequately addresses the BL 88-09 concerns for accelerated wear of
in-core thimble tubes in the applicant’s operating reactor designs.
Based on the staff’s review, this BL is resolved for the AP1000

BL 89-03 requires licensees to take actions to prevent potential loss
of required shutdown margin during the movement and placement of
highly reactive fuel during refueling operation.
In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse stated that this BL is not
applicable to the AP1000 design certification because this is a
procedural issue.  The applicant also referred questions about this
issue to DCD Tier 2, Sections 13.5.1, “Combined License Information
Item,” and 4.3.1.5, “Shutdown  Margins.”
The staff agrees that this BL involves procedures; however, these
procedures involve movement and placement of highly reactive fuel
during refueling within the core designed by the applicant.
DCD Tier 2, Section 9.1, discusses fuel storage and handling,
including the refueling equipment used to safely move and store
fuels.  Additionally, the IRWST provides large quantities of borated
water that maintain the required shutdown margin.  DCD Tier 2,

dated April 9, 2003, that the AP1000 has no ventilation filters inside
containment.  This satisfies the intent of BL 93-02 and resolves it for
the AP1000 design.  However, in WCAP-15800, Revision 3,
Westinghouse also specified that this is a procurement issue, and,
therefore, it is the responsibility of the COL applicant.  This is part of

This BL deals with the need for BWR licensees to ensure that their
suppression pools are relatively free of debris that could clog the
suction strainers of safety-related pumps which take suction from the
suppression pool.  In addition, the BL requests that BWR licensees
determine whether there are adequate controls to ensure that foreign
material exclusion (FME) procedures are effective. 
The AP1000’s IRWST serves several functions similar to those of
BWR suppression pools.  For example, it provides a source of
cooling water to the reactor core along with the CMTs and the
accumulators.  In addition, the first three stages of the ADS
discharge to the IRWST.  The IRWST is made of stainless steel and
thus would not constitute a significant source of corrosion products. 
Piping lines leading to the IRWST are also made of stainless steel or
are stainless steel clad.  Normally, closed louvers are designed to
prevent any debris from entering the IRWST through overflow and
vent lines during normal operation.
DCD Tier 2, Section 6.3.8.1, states the following:
The Combined License applicants referencing the
AP1000 will address preparation of a program to limit
the amount of debris that might be left in the
containment following refueling and maintenance
outages.  The cleanliness program will limit the
storage of outage materials (such as temporary
scaffolding and tools) inside containment during power
operation consistent with COL Item 6.3.8.2.

encountered in some PWR plants.  
In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse stated that this BL is not
applicable to the AP1000 design certification because it is a
procedural issue.  The IRI that led to the BLs was caused by thimble
tube distortion resulting from excessive load.  Because this is a fuel
design problem and the applicant has not committed to any fuel
manufacturers, the staff concluded that the applicant does not have
to address this issue, unless it has committed to certain fuel designs
discussed in the BL.  Resolution of this issue is the responsibility of
the COL applicant.  This is COL Action Item 20.7.1-1.  
Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000.

also requests that licensees review their plans and capabilities for
handling heavy loads and ensure that their load-handling operations
are in accordance with existing regulatory guidelines and the
licensing basis.
The resolution of USI A-36 in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.4, addresses
this issue.  That section states that the AP1000 design conforms to
NUREG-0612 and Section 9.1.5 of the SRP.

This BL provides the final resolution of the ECCS suction strainer
blockage issue for operating BWRs.  The resolution includes the
option of installing large passive suction strainers.  The staff
considers that the applicant has addressed this BL in large measure
through controlling potential sources of debris (e.g., prohibiting the
presence of installed fibrous material in zones of containment
vulnerable to jet impingement and flooding, constructing the IRWST
of stainless steel, and requiring a containment cleanliness program). 
The staff concludes that the applicant has adequately addressed the
root causes of strainer blockage identified in this BL and considers it
to be resolved for the AP1000 design. 
However, the staff is currently resolving a similar suction screen
blockage issue for the current generation of PWRs in conjunction
with GSI 191.  Section 6.2.1.8 of this report provides the staff’s
evaluation of the design of the IRWST and containment recirculation
screens in the context of Issue 191.  This is COL Action Items
6.2.1.8.1-1 and 6.2.1.8.1-2.

BL 2001-01, 
Circumferential
Cracking of RPV
Head Penetration

In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse indicated that DCD
Tier 2, Section 5.2.3, “Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary
Materials,” resolves this BL.  This section of the DCD Tier 2 indicates
that the use of Ni-Cr-Fe alloy in the AP1000 RCPB is limited to Alloy
690/52/152 materials.  While the staff agrees that the use of Alloy
690/52/152 materials is an improvement, the staff does not find that
this satisfactorily addresses all aspects of BL 2001-01.  The COL
applicant must perform additional inspections of the reactor vessel
closure head and head penetrations.  This is COL Action Item
4.5.1-1.  As part of its review of DCD Tier 2, Section 4.5.1, “Control

pertinent aspects of this BL as they apply to the design, fabrication,
and inspection of control rod drive nozzle penetrations.  Section 4.5.1

This BL sought information needed to determine the adequacy of PWR
plants’ Boric Acid Corrosion Control (BACC) Programs.  It required all
PWR addressees to submit to the NRC within 60 days the basis for
concluding that their BACC Program for the RCPB provides reasonable
assurance of compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. 
The BL indicated that the staff would use the information submitted to
determine the need for, and to guide the development of, additional
regulatory actions to address degradation of the RPV head and/or other
portions of the RCPB.
Experience with currently operating PWRs continues to show cracking of
Alloy 600 components.  Recent experience indicates that cracking has
even occurred in welds or components not previously expected to crack
based on the temperature of the weld or component and the time in
service.  The staff believes that the use of Alloy 690 materials in the
RCPB is a substantial improvement over the use of materials currently in
wide use in the industry.  However, data is not presently available to
demonstrate that cracking in these welds and components will not occur
over the projected 60-year lifetime of an AP1000 plant.  Bare metal
visual inspection of these locations is highly effective in identifying
locations where cracking occurs.  Technical specification requirements
prohibit through-wall leakage of the RCPB.  Therefore, the staff
requested that Westinghouse provide information describing the extent
to which the insulation of all Alloy 600/690 components and welds in the
RCPB (not just upper reactor vessel head penetrations) will readily
facilitate bare metal visual inspection during refueling outage conditions. 
This was Open Item 20.7-1 in the DSER.  In a letter dated May 21, 2003,
Westinghouse indicated that all the components with Alloy 690 type
materials are accessible for inspection.  For example, insulation can be
removed for visual inspection, if necessary.  Because these components
are accessible for inspection through removal of insulation and because
redesign of insulation to facilitate more rapid inspection, if necessary in
the future, is not a major modification, the staff concludes that
Westinghouse’s response is acceptable, and on this basis, Open
Item 20.7-1 is resolved.
In addition, as noted in the BL, the staff is considering the need for
additional regulatory actions to ensure that an effective program is in
place to monitor potential cracking of these susceptible materials and
ensure that the causes of cracking are appropriately addressed.  If the
staff develops new monitoring requirements, the staff will consider the
need to backfit these requirements on operating reactors and certified
designs, including the AP1000.
Based on the foregoing, this BL is resolved for the AP1000 design.

This issue was a DSER open item because DCD Tier 2 did not
comply with the current regulations for the control of combustible
gas in containment during accidents.  This was Open Item 6.2.5-1
in the DSER.
Subsequent to the publication of the DSER, the NRC revised its
regulations regarding the control of combustible gas in
containment.  The revised regulations were published on
September 16, 2003, and became effective on October 16, 2003. 
The NRC has extensively revised 10 CFR 50.44, “Combustible
Gas Control for Nuclear Power Reactors,” made associated
changes to Subsections 50.34 and 52.47, and added a new
section, Subsection 50.46a, “Acceptance Criteria for Reactor
Coolant System Venting Systems.”  The revisions apply to current
power reactor licensees, and also consolidate combustible gas
control regulations for future power reactor applicants and
licensees.  The revised rules eliminate the requirements for
hydrogen recombiners and hydrogen purge systems, and relax the
requirements for hydrogen and oxygen monitoring equipment to
make them commensurate with their risk significance.
Because the revised rules have generically eliminated the
hydrogen recombiner requirements, this generic letter is does not
apply to the AP1000 design and Open Item 6.2.5-1 is closed.
Therefore, based on the foregoing, this GL is resolved for the
AP1000 design.

necessary to the resolution of USI A-44.  As stated by the
applicant in DCD Tier 2, Section 1.9.1, and Appendix 1A,
concerning the inapplicability of RG 1.108, this GL is not
applicable because the DGs in the AP1000 design are not safety-

This GL is concerned with core peaking factors being greater than
assumed in safety analyses for extended low-power operation
followed by a return to full-power operation.  In WCAP-15800,
Revision 3, Westinghouse stated that this GL is not applicable to
the AP1000 design certification because it is an administrative
communication to the licensees.
However, during the review of the AP1000 safety analysis, the
staff considered the effect of extended low-power operation on
core peaking factors.  Chapter 15 of this report discusses the

In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, the applicant referred this issue to
DCD Tier 2, Section 15.4.6.  The staff evaluated and discussed
this issue in Chapter 15 of this report.  To mitigate the
consequence of this event, operator actions must isolate the
potential unborated water from the demineralized water transfer
and storage system, or CVS.  The staff states in COL Action

GL 85-06, Quality
Assurance Guidance
for ATWS Equipment
That is Not Safety
Related
10 CFR 50.62(c)(1) states, in part, that each PWR must have
equipment from sensor output to final actuation device, that is
diverse from the RTS, to automatically initiate the auxiliary (or
emergency) feedwater system and initiate a turbine trip under
conditions indicative of an ATWS event.  GL 85-06 provides the
explicit QA guidance required by 10 CFR 50.62, “Requirements for
Reduction of Risk From Anticipated Transients Without Scram
(ATWS) Events for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Plants,” for
the non-safety related SSCs required to mitigate an ATWS event
per 10 CFR 50.62(c)(1).  
During the evaluation of the applicant’s resolution of this generic
issue, the NRC staff reviewed 10 CFR 50.62; the QA guidance
contained in GL 85-06; AP1000 DCD Sections 15.8, “Anticipated
Transients Without Scram,” 17.3, “Quality Assurance,” Table 17-1,
“Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Systems,
Structures and Components Important to Investment Protection;”
and WCAP-15985, Revision 1, “AP1000 Implementation of the
Regulatory Treatment of Non-Safety Systems Process,” dated
April 2003.
In AP1000 DCD Section 15.8, the applicant stated that the
AP1000 DAS provides the ATWS mitigation systems actuation
circuitry protection features mandated for Westinghouse plants by
10 CFR 50.62.  For ATWS mitigation, the DAS trips the turbine
and actuates PRHR to provide decay heat removal for the
AP1000.  In DCD Section 7.7.2.11, “Diverse Actuation System,”
the applicant described the DAS as a non-safety-related system
that provides a diverse backup to the protection system.   The
staff’s safety evaluation of the AP1000 ATWS mitigation features
is described in Section 7.7.2, “Diverse Actuation System,” of this
report.
The applicant addressed QA requirements for the SSCs providing
ATWS mitigation under the RTNSS process described in
SECY-95-132, “Policy and Technical Issues Associated with the
Regulatory Treatment of Non-Safety Systems (RTNSS) in Passive
Designs.”  In WCAP-15985, the applicant provided the proposed
resolution for the AP1000 RTNSS policy issue.  Section 4.1 of
WCAP-15985 states that the DAS functions of reactor trip, turbine
trip, and PRHR actuation functions, and the associated non-
Class 1E dc and UPS system power supplies, are needed to meet
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.62.  Section 10.3.1 of WCAP-
15985 states that the QA guidance provided in GL 85-06 is

GL 85-06, Continued
applicable to the DAS.  However, the staff identified that
Section 10.3.3 of WCAP-15985 did not include a similar
requirement to apply the GL 85-06 quality control guidance to the
non-Class 1E and UPS power systems that support the DAS
ATWS functions.  The staff concluded that the non-Class 1E and
UPS power systems that support the DAS ATWS functions are
required to mitigate an ATWS event in accordance with 10 CFR
50.62 and should be subject to the GL 85-06 QA guidance.
The staff also noted that DCD Tier 2, Section 17.3 states that
quality requirements for systems, structures, and components
included in the RTNSS are identified in DCD Tier 2, Table 17-1.  
Furthermore, DCD Tier 2, Section 17.3 references DCD Tier 2,
Section 16.3, “Investment Protection,” for systems that should be
considered for designation of systems and components included in
the RTNSS.  The staff noted that the DAS system and the non-
Class 1E dc and UPS systems that provide power to DAS are
included within the scope of DCD Tier 2, Section 16.3. 
Additionally, the DAS manual controls are specified in the AP1000
TS 3.3.5 (DCD Chapter 16).  Therefore, the staff concluded that
the DAS and the associated non-Class 1E dc and UPS support
systems are subject to the DCD Tier 2, Table 17-1 QA controls. 
The staff reviewed DCD Tier 2, Table 17-1 QA controls and
determined that the QA controls specified in DCD Tier 2,
Table 17-1 adequately addressed quality assurance guidance for
non-safety related ATWS equipment in GL 85-06.
In comparing the information contained in the AP1000 DCD and
WCAP-15985, the staff noted that the QA controls specified for
the ATWS mitigation equipment required by 10 CFR 50.62
appeared to be inconsistent.  Specifically, the WCAP-15985 does
not specify quality assurance requirements for the non-Class 1E
and UPS systems, while the DCD indicates that these systems are
subject to quality assurance guidance equivalent to GL 85-06.  
Therefore, the staff determined that the applicant should clearly
state the QA requirements that are applicable to the DAS and non-
Class 1E and UPS systems for the purposes of satisfying the
requirements of GL 85-06.  This issue was identified as DSER
Open Item 20.7-2.
In August 2003, WCAP-15985, Revision 2, Westinghouse states
in Section 10.3-1, “Instrumentation Systems,” that the QA
guidance

provided in GL 85-06 is applicable to DAS because of the ATWS
mitigation functions (DCD Tier 2, Section 7.7.1.11).  
Westinghouse also states in DCD Tier 2, Section 10.3.3,
“Electrical Systems,” that the QA guidance provided in GL 85-06 is
applicable to the non-Class IE, dc and UPS systems because of
the ATWS mitigation functions (DCD Tier 2, Section 8.2.3.1.2). 
The NRC staff found that this adequately addresses QA
requirements for DAS, the non-Class 1E, dc and UPS systems for
the purposes of satisfying the requirements of GL 85-06;
therefore, Open Item 20.7-2 is resolved.
Based on the staff’s review, this GL is resolved for the AP1000
design.
GL 85-13, Transmittal

Regarding the
Davis-Besse Loss of
Main and Auxiliary 
Feedwater Event
NUREG-1154 addresses the loss of all feedwater event on June 9,
1985 at the Davis-Besse plant.  The causes of this event were
(1) the licensee’s lack of attention to detail in the care of plant
equipment, (2) the licensee’s history of poor performance in
troubleshooting, maintenance, and testing of equipment, (3) the
failure of the licensee’s evaluation of operating experience related
to equipment to always find the root causes of problems and
correct them, and (4) the licensee’s ineffective or unutilized
engineering design and analysis effort to evaluate equipment
problems.  On the basis of the above, the staff finds that an
inadequate system maintenance program caused the Davis-Besse
event.  
The AP1000 does not have an AFWS.  The SUFWS, described in
DCD Tier 2, Section 10.4.7.1, is not a safety-related system and is
not relied on to provide safety-related cooling for the RCS.  The
PXS, including the PRHR HXs, is the safety-related means of
providing emergency cooling for the RCS.  The applicant
addressed the Davis-Besse event in its plant operating and
maintenance procedures for the main and startup feedwater
systems.  DCD Tier 2, Section 13.5.1, identifies the COL applicant
as having the responsibility for the preparation of plant operating
procedures.  The staff agrees with the applicant’s assessment.

As a result of its review of the design-basis transients and
accidents analyses described in DCD Tier 2, Chapter 15, the staff
concludes that this GL is not applicable to the AP1000 design. 
This is because the AP1000 design does not include the two

Emergency Response
Data System
DCD Tier 2, Section 13.3, “Emergency Planning”, states that
emergency planning, including communication interfaces among
the MCR, the TSC, and the emergency planning centers, is the
responsibility of the COL applicant.  The COL applicant
referencing the AP1000 certified design will address emergency
planning, including post-72-hour actions and communications
interface.  DCD Tier 2, Section 9.5.2, “Communication System,”
provides that COL applicants referencing the AP1000 certified
design will address interfaces to required offsite locations.  The
COL applicant will also address the emergency response facility
communication system, including the crisis management radio
system.
Therefore, the staff concludes that this GL is not applicable to the
AP1000 design certification, and that it is the responsibility of the
COL applicant.  The staff notes, however, that 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix E, Section VI.2(a)(i), provides the selected emergency
response data system (ERDS) plant parameters for PWRs. 
Because of the unique design of the AP1000, the plant
parameters required for the ERDS will be similar, but not all
inclusive.  The COL applicant must review this GL and 10 CFR
Part 50, Appendix E, to ensure that the necessary AP1000 plant

GL 92-01, Revision 1, Supplement 1, requests all licensees to
review their RPV structural integrity assessments to identify,
collect, and report any new data pertinent to the analysis of the
structural integrity of their RPVs and to assess the impact of that
data on their RPV integrity analyses.  Similarly, the staff is
requesting that applicants using the AP1000 design, as part of
their actual plant submittal, provide the amount of copper, nickel,
and phosphorus contents, the initial RTNDT value, the projected
fluence at the end of the license period for the limiting material,
and the method of calculating the fluence.  This information will
confirm that the proposed P/T limits are in accordance with
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, and that the beltline materials
conform to the PTS criteria of 10 CFR 50.61.  By letter dated
November 7, 2003, Westinghouse indicated that the COL
applicant will address verification of plant-specific beltline material
properties consistent with DCD Tier 2, Section 5.3.3.1 concerning
P/T limit curves; DCD Tier 2, Table 5.3-1 concerning the maximum
limits for elements of the reactor vessel; and DCD Tier 2,
Table 5.3-3 concerning end-of-life RTNDT and upper shelf energy
projections.  The verification will include a PTS evaluation and an
upper shelf energy evaluation based on as-procured vessel
material data and the projected neutron fluences for the plant
design objective of 60-years.  The COL applicant will submit these
evaluation reports for NRC staff review.   The PTS evaluation will
include the copper, nickel, and phosphorus contents, the initial
RTNDT value, the projected fluence at the end of the license period
for the limiting material, and the method of calculating the fluence. 
The upper shelf energy evaluation will include the initial upper
shelf energy and the projection of upper shelf energy to the end of
life based on copper content and the projected fluence. 
Subsequent to the November 7, 2003, letter, Westinghouse added
this COL commitment to DCD Tier 2, Section 5.3.6.4. This
commitment is responsive to the information the staff requested

This GL addresses the single-failure vulnerability within the
applicant’s solid state rod control system that could cause
inadvertent withdrawal of control rods in a sequence resulting in a
power distribution not considered in the DBA. 
In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse referred to DCD
Tier 2, Section 3.9.4, “Control Rod Drive System,” to address this
issue.
WCAP-13864, Revision 1-A, “Rod Control System Evaluation
Program,” provided Westinghouse Owners Group’s resolution to
GL 93-04, including (1) the current order timing modification to
ensure that, if failures similar to those that occurred at Salem plant
are present, the control rods insert symmetrically, and
(2) additional surveillance tests at the beginning of each cycle.  In
its letter of April 2, 2003, Westinghouse stated that the AP1000
rod control system (described in DCD Tier 2, Section 7.7.1.2)
incorporates design improvements described in WCAP-13864,
Revision 1, and requires preoperational and startup testing as
specified in DCD Tier 2, Sections 14.2.9.1.8 and 14.2.10.1.11.

plants that may be susceptible to pressure locking or thermal
binding and to take necessary corrective actions to ensure
operability of the applicable valves.  
For the AP1000 DC, the staff’s position is that, in the design of
applicable valves, a commitment to incorporate provisions to
prevent these situations from occurring is sufficient to resolve this
GL.  
WCAP-15800, Revision 3, references DCD Tier 2,
Sections 5.4.8.1.2 and 5.4.8.2, for resolution of this GL.  The
staff’s review of this information concludes that DCD Tier 2,
Section 5.4.8, contains sufficient commitments to design

power-operated valves other than MOVs to demonstrate their
design-basis capability throughout the plant life.  DCD Tier 2,
Sections 3.9.8.4 and 5.4.8.5, contain COL applicant commitments
for IST in conformance with DCD Tier 2, Section 3.9.6 and
Table 3.9-16, and in situ testing to confirm the capacity of the

This GL addresses concerns associated with water hammer,
two-phase flow, and thermally induced overpressurization.  The
GL requests that licensees evaluate systems that are vulnerable to
these conditions, perform operability determinations as
appropriate per the guidance contained in GL 91-18, and take
necessary corrective actions per TS and requirements in 10 CFR
Part 50, Appendix B.  If  corrective actions are required, the
GL reminds licensees of their responsibility to ensure that systems
remain operable and can continue to perform their safety functions
while the corrective actions are being implemented.
In WCAP-15800, Revision 3, Westinghouse stated that DCD
Tier 2, Section 6.2.2, specifies that the cooling water to the
containment fan coolers is not safety-related.  DCD Tier 2,
Section 9.4.6, specifies that the containment recirculation cooling
system and its supporting subsystems are not safety-related. 
Therefore, GL 96-06 does not apply to this system.  The applicant
also stated that DCD Tier 2, Section 6.2.3.1.3, specifies that the

indicated that this GL is not applicable to the AP1000 design
certification because it is a procedural issue and the tube supports
are fabricated from stainless steel.
The staff agrees that this is a procedural issue to be addressed by
the COL applicant and that the likelihood of degradation of the SG
internals will be less given the AP1000 SG design; however, the
design does not eliminate the potential for degradation of the SG
internals.  As a result, the staff concludes that the COL applicant
will need to develop a program for periodic monitoring for potential
degradation of SG internals.  Subsequent to the issuance of the
DSER, Westinghouse added a commitment to DCD Tier 2,
Section 5.4.1.5, indicating that the COL applicant will develop a
program for periodic monitoring for potential degradation of SG
internals.  The staff finds this commitment acceptable as it

is not applicable to the AP1000 because the AP1000 does not rely
on pumps for emergency core cooling.
The AP1000 design relies on passive safety systems for the safety
functions of emergency core cooling and decay heat removal. 
These passive safety systems do not include pumps but rely on
natural forces, such as density differences, gravity, and stored
energy, to perform their safety functions.  The staff agrees that

This GL addresses the potential for degradation of the ECCS and
containment spray system during accident mitigation as a result of
failures of protective coatings and foreign materials in
containment.
The applicant has addressed the control of foreign material in
DCD Tier 2, Sections  6.1.2 and 6.3.8.1.  Section 6.3.8.1 states
the following:
The Combined License applicants referencing the
AP1000 will address preparation of a program to
limit the amount of debris that might be left in the
containment following refueling and maintenance
outages.  The cleanliness program will limit the
storage of outage materials (such as temporary
scaffolding and tools) inside containment during
power operation consistent with COL Item 6.3.8.2.
This is COL Action Item 6.2.1.8.1-1.
In DCD Tier 2, Section 6.1.3.2, the applicant addressed
programmatic controls to ensure the proper procurement,
application, and monitoring of safety-related coatings for the
AP1000.  Therefore, the staff concludes that the applicant has
resolved two of the three main issues raised in this GL.
With respect to the third issue of non-safety-related or unqualified
coatings, GL 98-04 offers the option of demonstrating that
compliance exists with 10 CFR 50.46(b)(5) without quantifying the
amount of unqualified coatings in containment.  As the AP1000
application does not contain a limit for unqualified coatings, the
staff assumes that the applicant has chosen this option. 
The staff reviewed this section of the DCD and documented its
conclusions in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.2.1.8 of this report.  On the
basis of that evaluation, the staff concludes that GL 98-04 is
resolved for the AP1000 design.
GL 99-02,  Laboratory
