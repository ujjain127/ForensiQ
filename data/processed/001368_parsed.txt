BILLING CODE 3510–60–S 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
Department of the Army; Army Corps 
of Engineers 
Intent To Prepare a Joint 
Environmental Impact Statement/ 
Environmental Impact Report for the 
River Mile 208, Sacramento River Bank 
Protection Project, CA 
AGENCY: Department of the Army, U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, DOD. 
ACTION: Notice of intent. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, Sacramento District, intends 
to prepare a joint environmental impact 
statement/environmental impact report 
(EIS/EIR) for the construction of bank 
protection at River Mile 208 on the 
Sacramento River to prevent continued 
bank erosion and potential outflanking 
of the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District 
Hamilton City Pumping Plant (HCPP), 
near Hamilton City, CA. The proposed 
action is being conducted under the 
HCPP Fish Screen Improvement Project. 
DATES: A public scoping meeting is 
being held on Thursday, January 29, 
2009, 7 to 9 pm at the Hamilton City 
High School (620 Canal Street, Hamilton 
City). Send written comments by 
February 16, 2009 to (see ADDRESSES). 
ADDRESSES: Written comments and 
suggestions concerning this project may 
be submitted to Mr. Matt Davis, U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento 
District, Attn: CESPK–PD–R, 1325 J 
Street, Sacramento, CA 95814–2922. 
Requests to be placed on the mailing list 
should also be sent to this address. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Questions about the proposed action 
and EIS/EIR should be addressed to the 
Corps: Matt Davis at (916) 557–6708, by 
e-mail 
Matthew.G.Davis@usace.army.mil, by 
fax (916) 557–7856; or to GCID: William 
Menke at (530) 934–8881, by e-mail 
bmenke@gcid.net. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento 
District (Corps) is the federal lead 
agency for compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for 
the Proposed Action. The Glenn-Colusa 
Irrigation District (GCID) is the state 
lead agency for compliance with the 
California Environmental Quality Act 
(CEQA) for the Proposed Action. 
1. Proposed Action. The Corps and 
GCID are preparing an EIS/EIR to 
analyze the impacts of constructing 
bank protection on the east bank of the 
Sacramento River at River Mile 208. The 
purpose of the proposed bank protection 
work is to prevent continued bank 
erosion and potential outflanking of 
GCID’s Hamilton City Pumping Plant 
(HCPP). Maintaining the river’s 
alignment upstream of the HCPP is 
important for the continued functioning 
of the pumping plant. The HCPP Fish 
Screen Improvement Project was 
constructed in 2000 to minimize losses 
of all fish from operation of the HCPP 
and to restore GCID’s capability to 
divert the full quantity of water it is 
entitled to divert to meet its water 
supply delivery obligations. GCID 
supplies water to 140,000 acres of 
farmland, over 20,000 acres of federal 
wildlife refuge, and 40,000 acres of 
other lands and wetlands from 
diversions at the HCPP. 
2. Alternatives. The EIS/EIR will 
address the No Action alternative and 
four action alternatives including three 
different types of bank protection 
alternatives and a levee setback 
alternative. The three types of bank 
protection alternatives differ from one 
another in the amount and extent of 
rock protection placed and the 
environmental features (e.g., vegetation 
and instream woody material) 
incorporated in the design. 
3. Scoping Process. 
a. A public scoping meeting will be 
held on Thursday, January 29, 2009 to 
present information to the public and to 
receive comments from the public. The 
meeting is intended to initiate the 
process to involve concerned 
individuals, and local, State, and 
Federal agencies. 
b. Significant issues to be analyzed in 
depth in the EIS/EIR include effects on 
hydraulics, wetlands and other waters 
of the U.S., river meander, vegetation 
and wildlife resources, special-status 
species, aesthetics, cultural resources, 
recreation, land use, fisheries, water 
quality, air quality, noise, 
transportation, visual resources, and 
socioeconomics; and cumulative effects 
of related projects in the study area. 
c. The Corps will consult with the 
State Historic Preservation Officer to 
comply with the National Historic 
Preservation Act and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and National Marine 
Fisheries Service to comply with the 
Endangered Species Act. The Corps is 
also coordinating with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to comply with the 
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. 
d. A 45-day public review period will 
be provided for individuals and 
agencies to review and comment on the 
draft EIS/EIR. All interested parties are 
encouraged to respond to this notice 
and provide a current address if they 
wish to be notified of the draft EIS/EIR 
circulation. 
4. Availability. The draft EIS/EIR is 
scheduled to be available for public 
review and comment in November 2009. 
Dated: December 23, 2008.
