ETS
O To determine the extent to which a demographically 
representative study population will be exposed to ETS 
differently than one selected primarily through random calling
O Target 60 non-smokers in each of four cells.
O Each subject wears a sampling pump at their workplace (8 
hours) and “away from work” (16 hours).
¾ Away-from-work includes commuting, shopping, dining, 
home, and sleeping.
O Particle and gas phase ETS components collected.
O Smoking status assessed using salivary cotinine.

Observations and Conclusions
Observations and Conclusions
O Recruiting subjects for exposure studies to match 
population demographics can be challenging, but CAN be 
done.
O The perception and reality of ETS exposure is frequently 
incongruent: reporting that one works in a smoking 
workplace and actually seeing smoking products is two 
different things.
O There exist general trends of more ETS exposure with 
increasing time spent around smokers.
O “Away-from-work” (eg. Home) appears even more 
dominant an exposure venue than in the 16 Cities Study.
29
Observations and Conclusions: 
Observations and Conclusions: 
continued
continued
O Estimated misclassification rates for never-smokers appear 
to be much higher than in 16 Cities Study.
O The fraction of RSP attributable to ETS appears to be 
substantially greater than that previously observed.
O Group-wise salivary cotinine appears to be less well 
correlated with nicotine exposure than for 16 Cities Study.
O This data set not supportive of rule of thumb model for 
exposure extrapolation from cotinine levels.
O Direct comparisons of TWA ETS levels between City #1 
(Knoxville) in 16 Cities Study with this study are mixed.
