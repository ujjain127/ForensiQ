PURPOSE 
 
• 
This MAPP provides clarification to Office of New Drug Quality Assessment (ONDQA) 
reviewers on the appropriate use of quality standards for excipients, drug substances, and drug 
products found in alternative compendia, specifically the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the 
European Pharmacopoeia (EP), and the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), during chemistry, 
manufacturing, and controls (CMC) review of new drug applications (i.e., investigational new 
drug applications (INDs) and new drug applications (NDAs)). 
 
• 
This MAPP is not intended to establish the BP, EP, and/or JP as official compendia in place of or 
in addition to the United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF). 
 
• 
This MAPP is not intended to preclude any current efforts to establish a process for evaluation 
and regulatory acceptance of harmonized analytical procedures and/or acceptance criteria. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
• 
It is not uncommon for drug sponsors and applicants to propose specifications (i.e., attributes, 
analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) for the excipients, drug substances, and drug 
products in their applications based on quality standards in the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the 
European Pharmacopoeia (EP), or the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP).  However, because the 
United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF) is a drug compendium officially 
recognized in the United States, reviewers have been reluctant to accept BP, EP, or JP quality 
standards as part of the drug application review process, even when the standards in the BP, EP, 
or JP are equivalent to or better than the corresponding USP/NF standards.  In the past, ONDQA 
reviewers gave varying advice to the pharmaceutical industry about the use of these standards in 
applications.  Some have informed companies that standards in USP/NF monographs must be 
used as the specifications; others have said that the standards in the BP/EP/JP monographs could 
be used, but the USP/NF monographs would be considered the official standards.

DEFINITIONS 
 
• 
Official Compendium:  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) uses this term to 
mean the official USP, the official NF, or the official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United 
States or any supplement to them. 
• 
Pharmacopeia:  A book containing the official standards for drug quality, published by the 
authority of a government or a medical or pharmaceutical society.  The most referenced 
pharmacopeias are the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), the 
Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).   
• 
British Pharmacopoeia (BP):  The official standards for medicinal and pharmaceutical 
substances in the United Kingdom.  The standards are legally enforceable in the United Kingdom 
and in most of the Commonwealth (http://www.pharmacopoeia.co.uk/).   
• 
European Pharmacopoeia (EP):  The official standards for medicines in Europe, including bulk 
drug substances, chemical and biological analytical methods, and reagents.  It is maintained and 
distributed by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (http://www.pheur.org).  
• 
Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP):  The official Japanese standards for the description and quality 
of drug substances and products.  It is maintained and distributed by the Society of Japanese 
Pharmacopoeia (http://www.sjp.jp/index_e.htm), a nonprofit organization authorized by the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.  
• 
United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF):  The official compendia of the 
United States of America for excipients, drug substances, and drug products.  It is published 
every year by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (http://www.usp.org/).  
 
 
POLICY 
 
• 
It is reasonable to accept an applicant’s proposal to use a quality standard from the BP, EP, or JP 
as part of the specifications for an excipient, drug substance, or drug product in the drug 
application, if the standard in the BP, EP, or JP is equivalent to or better than the corresponding 
standard in the USP/NF.  Equivalent standards have the same acceptance criteria and make use of 
analytical procedures based on similar principles (e.g., chromatographic, spectroscopic, titration) 
and performance characteristics (e.g., specificity, accuracy, precision).  A standard can be 
considered better than a corresponding standard for a number of reasons, including narrower 
ranges for acceptance criteria or superior performance of the analytical procedure (e.g, improved 
specificity, greater accuracy). 
• 
If there is no USP/NF monograph for an excipient, drug substance, or drug product, and the 
applicant proposes to use an analytical procedure from the BP, EP, or JP in a specification in lieu 
of the corresponding analytical procedure in the General Chapters of the USP/NF, the BP, EP, or 
JP procedure is considered an alternative analytical procedure and may be used provided the 
analytical procedure in the BP, EP, or JP is equivalent to or better than the corresponding 
analytical procedure in the USP/NF. 
• 
The USP/NF monographs are the official standards when excipients, drug substances, or drug 
products are tested for compliance with the USP/NF monograph.   
• 
This MAPP applies to the CMC evaluation of new drug applications performed by the 
CDER/OPS/Office of New Drug Quality Assessment.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES 
 
• 
It is the responsibility of the applicant to justify the use of a standard from the BP, EP, or JP in 
lieu of the USP/NF standard in the application.  The applicant should also provide a copy of the 
referenced BP, EP, or JP monograph or analytical procedure and a statement acknowledging the 
corresponding USP/NF monograph as the official standard or the corresponding analytical 
procedure as the regulatory analytical procedure. 
• 
The ONDQA CMC reviewer should assess the proposed specification to determine whether it can 
be considered to be equivalent to or better than the corresponding USP/NF standard.   
• 
The respective ONDQA Branch Chief and Division Director are responsible for the appropriate 
application of this MAPP.
