Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 150 / Monday, August 4, 2008 / Rules and Regulations 
1 Transient airflow conditions may cause air 
pressure differences between compartments, before 
the ventilation and pressurization system is 
reconfigured. Additional transients occur during 
changes to system configurations such as pack shut- 
down, fan shut-down, or changes in cabin altitude; 
transition in bleed source change, such as from 
intermediate stage to high stage bleed air; and cabin 
pressurization ‘‘fly-through’’ during descent may 
reduce air conditioning inflow. Similarly, in the 
event of a fire, a small quantity of smoke that 
penetrates into an occupied area before the 
ventilation system is reconfigured would be 
acceptable under certain conditions described 
within this special condition. 
electronic equipment bay from which 
the smoke is coming. 
These special conditions, therefore, 
require that there be a smoke or fire 
detection system in each electrical/ 
electronic equipment bay. They also 
include requirements to prevent 
propagation of hazardous quantities of 
smoke or fire extinguishing agent 
between or throughout the passenger 
cabins on the main deck and the upper 
deck. 
Discussion of Comments 
Notice of proposed special conditions 
No. 25–08–04–SC for the Embraer S.A., 
Model ERJ 190–100 ECJ airplanes was 
published in the Federal Register on 
April 21, 2008 (73 FR 21288). A 
comment was received was in favor of 
the proposed special conditions and 
these special conditions were adopted 
as proposed with one correction as 
defined below. 
During a review of the Notice of 
proposed special conditions No. 25–08– 
04–SC for the Embraer S.A., Model ERJ 
190–100 ECJ airplanes, the FAA noted 
that the proposed flight test special 
condition demonstrating that only a 
‘‘small quantity’’ of smoke may enter an 
occupied area from an electrical/ 
electronic equipment bay is not 
consistent with the ‘‘Discussion’’ 
section of the document. The 
‘‘Discussion’’ section clearly states that 
electrical/electronic equipment bays 
located below, on, and above the main 
deck of an airplane present a greater risk 
of smoke penetration than older designs. 
The proposed flight test special 
condition was inadvertently limited to 
smoke penetration flight tests for 
electrical/electronic equipment bays 
located on the main deck of the 
airplane. The final special condition has 
been corrected to reflect the FAA’s 
original intent to require smoke 
penetration flight tests from all 
electrical/electronic equipment bay 
locations. 
Applicability 
As discussed above, these special 
conditions are applicable to the Embraer 
S.A., Model ERJ 190–100 ECJ airplanes. 
Should Embraer S.A., apply at a later 
date for a change to the type certificate 
to include another model on the same 
type certificate incorporating the same 
novel or unusual design feature, the 
special conditions would apply to that 
model as well. 
Conclusion 
This action affects only certain novel 
or unusual design features on Model ERJ 
190–100 ECJ airplanes. It is not a rule 
of general applicability. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 
Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting 
and recordkeeping requirements. 
The authority citation for these 
special conditions is as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701, 
44702, 44704. 
The Special Conditions 
I Accordingly, pursuant to the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the following special conditions are 
issued as part of the type certification 
basis for Embraer S.A., Model ERJ 190– 
100 ECJ airplanes. 
1. Requirements to prevent 
propagation of smoke or extinguishing 
agents from entering the flight deck and 
passenger cabin: 
(a) To prevent such propagation the 
following must be demonstrated: A 
means to prevent hazardous quantities 
of smoke or extinguishing agent 
originating from the electrical 
equipment bays from incapacitating 
passengers and crew. 
(b) A ‘‘small quantity’’ of smoke may 
enter an occupied area only under the 
following conditions: 
(1) The smoke enters occupied areas 
during system transients 1 from a source 
located below the flight deck and 
passenger cabin or on the same level as 
the flight deck and passenger cabin. No 
sustained smoke penetration beyond 
that from environmental control system 
transients is permitted. 
(2) Penetration of the small quantity 
of smoke is a dynamic event, involving 
either dissipation or mobility. 
Dissipation is rapid dilution of the 
smoke by ventilation air, and mobility is 
rapid movement of the smoke into and 
out of the occupied area. In no case 
should there be formation of a light haze 
indicative of stagnant airflow, as this 
would indicate that the ventilation 
system is failing to meet the 
requirements of § 25.831(b). 
(3) The smoke from a smoke source 
below the flight deck and passenger 
cabin must not rise above armrest 
height. 
(4) The smoke from a source in an 
electrical/electronic equipment bay 
must dissipate rapidly via dilution with 
fresh air and be evacuated from the 
airplane. A procedure must be included 
in the Airplane Flight Manual to 
evacuate smoke from the occupied areas 
of the airplane. In order to demonstrate 
that the quantity of smoke is small, a 
flight test must be conducted which 
simulates the emergency procedures 
used in the event of a fire during flight, 
including the use of Vmo/Mmo descent 
profiles and a simulated landing, if such 
conditions are specified in the 
emergency procedure. 
2. Requirement for fire detection in 
electrical/electronic equipment bays: 
(a) A smoke or fire detection system 
compliant with §§ 25.858 and 25.855 
must be provided that will detect fire/ 
smoke within each electrical/electronic 
equipment bay. 
(b) Each system must provide a visual 
indication to the flight deck within one 
minute after the start of a fire in an 
electrical/electronic equipment bay. 
(c) Airplane flight tests must be 
conducted to show compliance with 
these requirements, and the 
performance of the smoke or fire 
detectors must be shown in accordance 
with guidance provided in the latest 
version of Advisory Circular 25–9, or 
other means acceptable to the FAA. 
(d) A procedure to shut down all non- 
essential systems in the electrical/ 
electronic equipment bays following a 
smoke detection in any electrical/ 
electronic equipment bay must be 
included in the Airplane Flight Manual.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Throughout this document whenever 
‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ or ‘‘our’’ is used, we mean 
EPA. This supplementary information 
section is arranged as follows: 
I. What is EPA approving? 
II. What is EPA’s analysis of the revisions? 
III. What are the environmental effects of this 
action? 
IV. What action is EPA taking? 
V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews 
I. What is EPA approving? 
EPA is approving an Illinois SIP 
revision that adds to the list of 
compounds that are exempt from being 
considered a VOC. On January 29, 2008, 
Illinois submitted its revised 35 Illinois 
Administrative Code (IAC) 211.7150(a), 
the state’s VOC exemption list, with the 
addition of 1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5- 
decafluoro-3-methoxy-4- 
trifluoromethyl-pentane (HFE–7300), 
C2F5CF(OCH3)CF(CH3)2, requesting that 
this revised rule be incorporated into 
the Illinois SIP in place of the current 
35 IAC 211.7150(a). Compounds listed 
under 35 IAC 211.7150(a) are 
considered to be excluded from the 
definition of a VOC. These compounds 
were determined to have negligible 
photochemical reactivity. Users of the 
listed compounds are not required to 
follow VOC limits or content 
requirements. 
II. What is EPA’s analysis of the 
revisions? 
EPA evaluated the petition to list 
HFE–7300 as a negligibly reactive 
compound submitted by its 
manufacturer. On January 18, 2007, 
EPA’s approval (72 FR 2193) of adding 
HFE–7300 to its list of compounds that 
are not considered VOCs was effective. 
The reactivity of this compound with 
the hydroxyl radical (OH), the primary 
way by which most organic compounds 
initially participate in atmospheric 
reactions that lead to ozone formation, 
was compared to the reactivity of 
ethane. The reactivity of ethane is the 
benchmark EPA considers in 
determining if an organic compound is 
negligibly reactive. For HFE–7300, the 
reactivity (kOH) was determined to be 
1.5 × 10¥14 cm3/molecule/sec. This is 
lower than ethane’s kOH of 2.4 × 10¥13 
cm3/molecule/sec. Thus, EPA considers 
HFE–7300 to be a negligibly reactive 
compound. EPA made this 
determination only for the compound in 
its pure form, meaning at least 99.96 
percent by weight. Any azeotrope 
mixtures or organic blends of HFE–7300 
are not exempt and thus are considered 
VOCs. 
III. What are the environmental effects 
of this action? 
Volatile organic compounds are 
precursors to ozone formation. Complex 
photochemical reactions involving 
VOCs form tropospheric ozone. 
Ozone decreases lung function, 
causing chest pain and coughing. It can 
aggravate asthma, reduce lung capacity, 
and increase risk of respiratory diseases 
like pneumonia and bronchitis. 
Children playing outside and healthy 
adults who work or exercise outside 
may also be harmed by elevated ozone 
levels. Ozone also reduces vegetation 
growth in economically important 
agricultural crops and wild plants. 
EPA has determined that HFE–7300 
makes a negligible contribution to ozone 
formation. Thus, the compound is no 
longer considered to be a VOC for 
emission control purposes, and the 
exemptions will not harm air quality. In 
fact, if sources switch from the use of a 
VOC compound to one of the 
compounds that are no longer 
considered VOC, ozone formation may 
be reduced.

IV. What action is EPA taking? 
EPA is approving revisions to the 
Illinois SIP for ozone. This revision 
adds one compound to the list of 
compounds considered exempt from 
being a VOC compound. The compound 
HFE–7300 is added to the exempt 
compounds list. Illinois sources are not 
required to follow VOC limits or content 
requirements when using HFE–7300. 
We are publishing this action without 
prior proposal because we view this as 
a noncontroversial amendment and 
anticipate no adverse comments. 
However, in the proposed rules section 
of this Federal Register publication, we 
are publishing a separate document that 
will serve as the proposal to approve the 
state plan if relevant adverse written 
comments are filed. This rule will be 
effective October 3, 2008 without 
further notice unless we receive relevant 
adverse written comments by September 
3, 2008. If we receive such comments, 
we will withdraw this action before the 
effective date by publishing a 
subsequent document that will 
withdraw the final action. All public 
comments received will then be 
addressed in a subsequent final rule 
based on the proposed action. The EPA 
will not institute a second comment 
period. Any parties interested in 
commenting on this action should do so 
at this time. If we do not receive any 
comments, this action will be effective 
October 3, 2008. 
V. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Under the Clean Air Act, the 
Administrator is required to approve a 
SIP submission that complies with the 
provisions of the Act and applicable 
Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 
40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP 
submissions, EPA’s role is to approve 
state choices, provided that they meet 
the criteria of the Clean Air Act. 
Accordingly, this action merely 
approves state law as meeting Federal 
requirements and does not impose 
additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by state law. For that reason, 
this action: 
• Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget under 
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 
October 4, 1993); 
• Does not impose an information 
collection burden under the provisions 
of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); 
• Is certified as not having a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.); 
• Does not contain any unfunded 
mandate or significantly or uniquely 
affect small governments, as described 
in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4); 
• Does not have Federalism 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999); 
• Is not an economically significant 
regulatory action based on health or 
safety risks subject to Executive Order 
13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997); 
• Is not a significant regulatory action 
subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 
28355, May 22, 2001); 
• Is not subject to requirements of 
Section 12(d) of the National 
Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because 
application of those requirements would 
be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; 
and 
• Does not provide EPA with the 
discretionary authority to address, as 
appropriate, disproportionate human 
health or environmental effects, using 
practicable and legally permissible 
methods, under Executive Order 12898 
(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). 
In addition, this rule does not have 
tribal implications as specified by 
Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, 
November 9, 2000), because the SIP is 
not approved to apply in Indian country 
located in the state, and EPA notes that 
it will not impose substantial direct 
costs on tribal governments or preempt 
tribal law. 
The Congressional Review Act, 5 
U.S.C. 801 et seq., as added by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides 
that before a rule may take effect, the 
agency promulgating the rule must 
submit a rule report, which includes a 
copy of the rule, to each House of the 
Congress and to the Comptroller General 
of the United States. EPA will submit a 
report containing this action and other 
required information to the U.S. Senate, 
the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
the Comptroller General of the United 
States prior to publication of the rule in 
the Federal Register. A major rule 
cannot take effect until 60 days after it 
is published in the Federal Register. 
This action is not a ‘‘major rule’’ as 
defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean 
Air Act, petitions for judicial review of 
this action must be filed in the United 
States Court of Appeals for the 
appropriate circuit by October 3, 2008. 
Filing a petition for reconsideration by 
the Administrator of this final rule does 
not affect the finality of this action for 
the purposes of judicial review nor does 
it extend the time within which a 
petition for judicial review may be filed, 
and shall not postpone the effectiveness 
of such rule or action. This action may 
not be challenged later in proceedings to 
enforce its requirements. (See section 
307(b)(2).)
