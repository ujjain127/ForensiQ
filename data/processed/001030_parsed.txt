Generic New Animal Drug User Fee 
Rates and Payment Procedures for 
Fiscal Year 2009 
AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration 
ACTION: Notice 
SUMMARY: The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) is announcing the 
rates and payment procedures for fiscal 
year (FY) 2009 generic new animal drug 
user fees. The Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by 
the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act 
of 2008 (AGDUFA), authorizes FDA to 
collect user fees for certain abbreviated 
applications for a generic new animal 
drug, on certain generic new animal 
drug products, and on certain sponsors 
of such abbreviated applications for 
generic new animal drugs and/or 
investigational submissions for generic 
new animal drugs. This notice 
establishes the fee rates for FY 2009. 
For FY 2009, the generic new animal 
drug user fee rates are: $41,400 for each 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug; $3,005 for each 
generic new animal drug product; 
$56,350 for each generic new animal 
drug sponsor paying 100 percent of the 
sponsor fee; $42,265 for each generic 
new animal drug sponsor paying 75 
percent of the sponsor fee; and $28,175 
for a generic new animal drug sponsor 
paying 50 percent of the sponsor fee. 
FDA will issue invoices for FY 2009 
product and sponsor fees by December 
31, 2008, or within 30 days of 
enactment of an appropriation for these 
fees, whichever is later. These fees will 
be due and payable within 30 days of 
the issuance of the invoices. 
The application fee rates are effective 
for all abbreviated applications for 
generic new animal drugs submitted on 
or after July 1, 2008, and will remain in 
effect through September 30, 2009. 
However, FDA may not collect 
application fees until enactment of an 
appropriation for these fees. Within 30 
days of enactment of an appropriation 
for these fees, FDA will issue invoices 
for applications received on or after July 
1, 2008, and will publish a Federal 
Register notice stating that for the 
remainder of fiscal year 2009 FDA will 
not accept any further abbreviated 
applications for generic new animal 
drugs for review until FDA has received 
full payment of application fees and any 
other generic new animal drug user fees 
owed. That Federal Register notice will 
also provide instructions for payment of 
abbreviated applications for generic new 
animal drug fees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Section 741 of the act (21 U.S.C. 379j– 
21) establishes three different kinds of 
user fees: (1) Fees for certain types of 
abbreviated applications for generic new 
animal drugs, (2) annual fees for certain 
generic new animal drug products, and 
(3) annual fees for certain sponsors of 
abbreviated applications for generic new 
animal drugs and/or investigational 
submissions for generic new animal 
drugs (21 U.S.C. 379j–21(a)). When 
certain conditions are met, FDA will 
waive or reduce fees for generic new 
animal drugs intended solely to provide 
for a minor use or minor species 
indication (21 U.S.C. 379j–21(d)). 
For FY 2009 through FY 2013, the act 
establishes aggregate yearly base 
revenue amounts for each of these fee 
categories. Base revenue amounts 
established for years after FY 2009 are 
subject to adjustment for workload. Fees 
for applications, products, and sponsors 
are to be established each year by FDA 
so that the revenue for each fee category 
will approximate the level established

Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 179 / Monday, September 15, 2008 / Notices 
in the statute, after the level has been 
adjusted for workload. 
II. Revenue Amount for FY 2009 
A. Statutory Fee Revenue Amounts 
AGDUFA (Title II of Public Law 110– 
316 signed by the President on August 
14, 2008) specifies that the aggregate 
revenue amount for FY 2009 for 
abbreviated application fees is 
$1,449,000, and the other two generic 
new animal drug user fee categories, 
annual product fees and annual sponsor 
fees, are $1,691,000 each, before any 
adjustment for workload is made (see 21 
U.S.C. 379j–21(b)). 
B. Inflation Adjustment to Fee Revenue 
Amount 
The amounts established in AGDUFA 
for each year for FY 2009 through FY 
2013 include an inflation adjustment, so 
no further inflation adjustment is 
required. 
C. Workload Adjustment Fee Revenue 
Amount 
For each FY beginning after FY 2009, 
AGDUFA provides that statutory fee 
revenue amounts shall be further 
adjusted to reflect changes in review 
workload (21 U.S.C. 379j–21(c)(1)). No 
workload adjustment is to be made in 
fee revenue amounts for FY 2009. 
III. Abbreviated Application Fee 
Calculations for FY 2009 
The term ‘‘abbreviated application for 
a generic new animal drug’’ is defined 
in 21 U.S.C. 379j–21(k)(1). 
A. Application Fee Revenues and 
Numbers of Fee-Paying Applications 
The application fee must be paid for 
abbreviated applications for generic new 
animal drugs that are subject to fees 
under AGDUFA and that are submitted 
on or after July 1, 2008. The application 
fees are to be set so that they will 
generate $1,449,000 in fee revenue for 
FY 2009. This is the amount set out in 
the statute and no adjustments to it are 
required for FY 2009. 
To set fees for abbreviated 
applications for generic new animal 
drugs to realize $1,449,000, FDA must 
first make some assumptions about the 
number of fee-paying abbreviated 
applications it will receive over the 15 
months from July 1, 2008 through 
September 30, 2009. 
The agency knows the number of such 
applications that have been submitted 
in previous years. That number 
fluctuates significantly from year to 
year. FDA is assuming that the number 
of abbreviated applications that will pay 
fees in FY 2009 will equal the average 
number of submissions over the 4 most 
recent years. This may not fully account 
for possible year to year fluctuations in 
numbers of fee-paying applications, but 
FDA believes that this is a reasonable 
approach after about 5 years of 
experience with other user fee 
programs. Further, because the 
imposition of a fee may reduce 
somewhat the number of abbreviated 
applications submitted, FDA will use a 
12-month average estimate in estimating 
the number of abbreviated applications 
that will be subject to and pay fees in 
the 15-month period from July 1, 2008 
through September 30, 2009. 
Over the past 4 years, the average 
number of abbreviated applications for 
generic new animal drugs that would 
have been subject to the fee was 38.75, 
including the number for the most 
recent year, which is estimated at 40. 
FDA will also assume that 10 percent of 
these applications, or 3.875, may be 
subject to fee waivers or reduction based 
on indications solely for minor use or 
minor species. 
Thus, for FY 2009, FDA estimates 
receipt of 34.55 (38.75 minus 3.875) fee- 
paying abbreviated applications. 
B. Fee Rates for FY 2009 
FDA must set the fee rates for FY 2009 
so that the estimated 35 abbreviated 
applications that pay the fee will 
generate a total of $1,449,000. To 
generate this amount, the fee for an 
animal drug application, rounded to the 
nearest hundred dollars, will have to be 
$41,400. 
IV. Generic Product Fee Calculations 
for FY 2009 
A. Product Fee Revenues and Numbers 
of Fee-Paying Products 
The generic new animal drug product 
fee (also referred to as the product fee) 
must be paid annually by the person 
named as the applicant in an 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug or a supplemental 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug product submitted for 
listing under section 510 of the act (21 
U.S.C. 360), and who had an 
abbreviated application or a 
supplemental abbreviated application 
for a generic new animal drug product 
pending at FDA after September 1, 2008 
(see 21 U.S.C. 379j–21(a)(2)). The term 
‘‘generic new animal drug product’’ 
means each specific strength or potency 
of a particular active ingredient or 
ingredients in final dosage form 
marketed by a particular manufacturer 
or distributor, which is uniquely 
identified by the labeler code and 
product code portions of the national 
drug code, and for which an abbreviated 
application for a generic new animal 
drug or supplemental abbreviated 
application for a generic new animal 
drug has been approved (21 U.S.C. 379j– 
21(k)(6)). The product fees are to be set 
so that they will generate $1,691,000 in 
fee revenue for FY 2009. This is the 
amount set out in the statute and no 
further adjustments are required for FY 
2009. 
To set generic new animal drug 
product fees to realize $1,691,000, FDA 
must make some assumptions about the 
number of products for which these fees 
will be paid in FY 2009. FDA developed 
data on all generic new animal drug 
products that have been submitted for 
listing under section 510 of the act, and 
matched this to the list of all persons 
who FDA estimated would have an 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug or supplemental 
abbreviated application pending after 
September 1, 2008. FDA estimates there 
is a total of 626 products submitted for 
listing by persons who had an 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug or supplemental 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug pending after 
September 1, 2008. Based on this, FDA 
believes that a total of 626 products will 
be subject to this fee in FY 2009. 
In estimating the fee revenue to be 
generated by generic new animal drug 
product fees in FY 2009, FDA is 
assuming that 10 percent of the 
products invoiced, or 63, will not pay 
fees in FY 2009 due to fee waivers and 
reductions. Based on experience with 
other user fee programs and the first 5 
years of the Animal Drug User Fee Act 
program (ADUFA), FDA believes that 
this is a reasonable basis for estimating 
the number of fee-paying products in FY 
2009. 
Accordingly, the agency estimates 
that a total of 563 (626 minus 63) 
products will be subject to product fees 
in FY 2009. 
B. Product Fee Rates for FY 2009 
FDA must set the fee rates for FY 2009 
so that the estimated 563 products that 
pay fees will generate a total of 
$1,691,000. To generate this amount 
will require the fee for a generic new 
animal drug product, rounded to the 
nearest five dollars, to be $3,005. 
V. Generic New Animal Drug Sponsor 
Fee Calculations for FY 2009 
A. Sponsor Fee Revenues and Numbers 
of Fee-Paying Sponsors 
The generic new animal drug sponsor 
fee (also referred to as the sponsor fee) 
must be paid annually by each person 
who: (1) Is named as the applicant in an

Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 179 / Monday, September 15, 2008 / Notices 
abbreviated application for a generic 
new animal drug, that has not been 
withdrawn by the applicant and for 
which approval has not been withdrawn 
by the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, or has submitted an 
investigational submission for a generic 
new animal drug that has not been 
terminated or otherwise rendered 
inactive; and (2) had an abbreviated 
application for a generic new animal 
drug, supplemental abbreviated 
application for a generic new animal 
drug, or investigational submission for a 
generic new animal drug pending at 
FDA after September 1, 2008 (see 21 
U.S.C. 379j–21(k)(7) and 379j–21(a)(3)). 
A generic new animal drug sponsor is 
subject to only one such fee each fiscal 
year (see 21 U.S.C. 379j–21(a)(3)(B)). 
Applicants with more than six approved 
abbreviated applications will pay 100 
percent of the sponsor fee, applicants 
with two to six approved abbreviated 
applications will pay 75 percent of the 
sponsor fee, and applicants with one or 
fewer approved abbreviated 
applications will pay 50 percent of the 
sponsor fee (see 21 U.S.C. 379j– 
21(a)(3)(B)). The sponsor fees are to be 
set so that they will generate $1,691,000 
in fee revenue for FY 2009. This is the 
amount set out in the statute and no 
adjustments are required for FY 2009. 
To set generic new animal drug 
sponsor fees to realize $1,691,000, FDA 
must make some assumptions about the 
number of sponsors who will pay these 
fees in FY 2009. Based on the number 
of firms that would have met this 
definition in each of the past 5 years, 
FDA estimates that in FY 2009 11 
sponsors will pay 100 percent (full) fees, 
11 sponsors will pay 75 percent fees, 
and 28 sponsors will pay 50 percent 
fees. That totals the equivalent of 33.25 
full sponsor fees (11 times 100 percent 
or 11, plus 11 times 75 percent or 8.25, 
plus 28 times 50 percent or 14). 
FDA estimates that about 10 percent 
of all of these sponsors, or 3.25, may 
qualify for a minor use/minor species 
waiver or reduction. 
Accordingly, the agency estimates 
that the equivalent of 30 full sponsor 
fees (33.25 minus 3.25) are likely to be 
paid in FY 2009. 
B. Sponsor Fee Rates for FY 2009 
FDA must set the fee rates for FY 2009 
so that the estimated equivalent of 30 
full sponsor fees will generate a total of 
$1,691,000. To generate this amount 
will require the 100-percent fee for a 
generic new animal drug sponsor, 
rounded to the nearest fifty dollars, to 
be $56,350. Accordingly, the fee for 
those paying 75 percent of the full 
sponsor fee, rounded to the nearest five 
dollars, will be $42,265, and the fee for 
those paying 50 percent of the full 
sponsor fee will be $28,175. 
VI. Fee Schedule for FY 2009 
The fee rates for FY 2009 are 
summarized in table 1 of this document.

VII. Procedures for Paying FY 2009 
Generic New Animal Drug User Fees 
FDA may not collect user fees for 
abbreviated applications, for generic 
new animal drug products, and for 
generic new animal drug sponsors until 
an appropriation of fees is provided by 
Congress (see 21 U.S.C. 379j–21(g)(1)). 
For this reason FDA may not begin to 
collect these fees at this time. 
Fees for generic new animal drug 
products and sponsors will be invoiced 
at the rates published in this notice on 
the later of December 31, 2008, or 30 
days after appropriation of generic new 
animal drug user fees by Congress. 
Invoices for fees for abbreviated 
applications for generic new animal 
drugs submitted on or after July 1, 2008, 
will be issued 30 days after 
appropriation of generic new animal 
drug user fees by Congress. After that 
time, FDA will not consider an 
abbreviated application for a generic 
abbreviated new animal drug complete 
unless the application fee for that 
application has been paid in advance. 
Within 30 days after appropriation of 
generic new animal drug user fees by 
Congress, FDA will publish another 
notice in the Federal Register providing 
payment instructions so that these fees 
may be paid in advance of the 
submission of such abbreviated 
applications from that time forward.
