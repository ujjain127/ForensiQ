ROMANIZATION POLICIES FOR CATALOGING CHINESE MATERIAL 
Revised February 23, 2004 
 
Separation of Syllables 
 
Separate the romanization of each Chinese character with a space, except as directed below.  
This includes corporate names, terms of address and titles of royalty. Do not join syllables of 
general, non-specific geographic terms. 
 
1. Terms of address.  A term of address may follow a surname, a courtesy name, or another 
appellation.  Separate syllables in the term of address.  If a term appearing as an integral part 
of a name is not a title or term of address, romanize the name in running form, as a forename 
(see below). 
 
Certain terms, such as  先生 (xian sheng) are sometimes used as terms of address, and 
sometimes as forenames (i.e., pseudonyms or pen names).   When they are used as 
terms of address, separate syllables; however, when they are used as forenames, 
romanize the name in running form (see Connection of syllables, section 1A).   
 
When establishing a forename followed by a term of address, a title of position or 
office, enter under the forename.  Refer from the name in direct order. 
 
 
白沙先生 
 
 
 
 
Romanize name as:  
 
Baisha xian sheng 
 
Heading established as:  
Chen, Xianzhang, $d 1428-1500 
 
Give reference as: 
 
Baisha xian sheng, $d 1428-1500 
 
Also give reference as:   
Baisha, $c xian sheng, $d 1428-1500 
 
When establishing names that consist of a surname followed by a term of address, 
follow AACR2 rule 22.15A by adding the word or phrase to the surname.  Separate the 
term of address from the surname with a comma in the heading.  Refer from the name 
in direct order. 
 
 
林老师  
 
 
Romanize name as:  
 
Lin lao shi 
 
Heading established as:   
Lin, $c lao shi

Heading established as:   
Wei, $c dai fu 
 
Give reference as:

2. Titles, and titles of royalty.  Syllables in a title should be separated and written in lower-
case.  If a term appearing as an integral part of a name is not a title or term of address, 
romanize the name in running form, as a forename.  An epithet is separated from the name 
of a person, using lower case letters and separated syllables. 
 
Follow AACR2 rule 22.12 when establishing names that include titles of nobility and 
terms of honor.  Note that this rule applies to names that consist of a surname and a 
title, or a forename and a title.  Names with titles will be established as: Name, $c title.  
Examples of Chinese titles include: fei and gui fei. 
 
 
董鄂妃 
 
 
Romanize name as:  
 
Donge fei 
 
Heading established as:  
Donge, $c fei, $d 1638-1660

Heading established as:  
Yang, $c gui fei, $d 719-756 
 
Give reference as: 
 
Yang gui fei, $d 719-756 
 
Headings for persons with the highest royal status are established according to AACR2 
rule 22.16A1.  Enter the name in direct order. 
 
 
慈禧皇太后 
 
 
 
Romanize name as:

Yang, $c tai hou, $d 1162-1233 
 
 
 
Yang tai hou, $d 1162-1233 
 
3. General, non-specific geographic terms.  Some terms have both general and specific usage, 
depending upon context.  For example, when the term 东北  refers to the direction northeast, 
or, in a general way, to the Northeast, separate syllables; when it is used to refer specifically 
to Manchuria, capitalize and join syllables.

Connection of syllables. 
 
1. Join together (without spaces or hyphens) the syllables associated with multi-character 
surnames and given names.  Also join together given names, Buddhist names, courtesy 
names, etc., in more than one syllable.  For example: 
 
            孫中山 
Sun Zhongshan 
            歐陽修 
Ouyang Xiu 
 
司馬相如 
 
Sima Xiangru 
 
尼克森 
Nikesen 
 
康有為 
Kang Youwei 
 
1A. Forenames, given names, courtesy names. A forename does not include a person's surname. 
Only capitalize the first letter of a forename. If a term appearing as an integral part of a 
name is not a title or term of address, romanize the name in running form. 
 
Certain terms, such as  先生 (xian sheng) are sometimes used as terms of address, and 
sometimes as forenames (i.e., pseudonyms or pen names).   When they are used as 
forenames, romanize the name in running form (see Connection of syllables, section 
1A); however, when they are used as terms of address, separate syllables (see 
Separation of syllables, section 1A).   
 
There are many sorts of Chinese forenames.  It is frequently difficult to clearly divide 
syllables because the structure or origin of terms, or the meanings of the characters 
themselves, are obscure.  Therefore, to promote consistent application and to save time, 
all forenames will be romanized with connected syllables, leaving no space between 
them.  Alternative forms of access may be given for the form which a cataloger feels 
that a user might employ to find a name (for example, romanized form, 
Wugangzhuren; possible reference, Wugang zhuren) 
 
 
無 名氏 
 
 
Romanize name as:  
 
Wumingshi 
 
Heading established as:   
Wumingshi, $c pseud. (AACR2 compatible heading)

1D. Names of persons of religious vocation.  Separate a term of address from a family name or 
forename.  Syllables of a term of address should be written separately and in lower case. 
 In a heading or reference, the term of address should appear in the $c subfield, 
following the surname or forename.  See AACR2 rule 22.16D for instructions on 
headings for persons of religious vocation.

2B. Generic terms for geographical features are capitalized and separated from the names of the 
features. 
 
 
NOTE: PROPOSED CHANGE: add three sentences; the highlighted examples have been 
changed to conform: 
 
 
The syllables of the name of a jurisdiction or geographic feature that are included within 
another place name are connected together.  These practices are also followed when 
geographic names appear within corporate names.  In case of doubt, separate. 
 
   
Because the conversion programs connected hyphenated Wade-Giles syllables together 
when converting them to pinyin, the romanized forms of many geographical features 
were converted into forms that to not follow the new pinyin romanization guidelines.  
For example, Huang-ho (Yellow River in Wade-Giles) was converted by the program 
to Huanghe.  This romanized form must now be manually changed to the correct 
pinyin form, Huang He.  Locating romanized strings for geographical features that 
now need to be corrected may be time-consuming and difficult.*   Refer to GEOnet 
(GNS) to identify generic terms for place names, or do so using one’s knowledge of the 
Chinese language.  Place names should be systematically romanized in descriptive 
strings.  Please note:  place names that are included within other place names may be 
romanized differently than when they stand alone.   For example, the name of the river
长江is romanized Chang Jiang, but the name of the Mouth of the river 长江口is 
romanized Changjiang Kou.   Also, please note that the form of name found in 
headings may vary from the systematically romanized form.

* Decisions about romanization should not be made without first determining, insofar as 
possible, the meaning of a romanized string.  To do this for a roman-only record, one must try to 
figure out what characters a romanized string represents, and then what those characters mean.  
The presence of corresponding characters in 880 fields usually helps one determine meaning.  
However, the same character or characters may have different meanings on different records.    
For example, 
 
Characters in title / romanization  
refers to 
 
1. 金山民间传说

In some instances, however, the information on the bibliographic record does not provide us 
with enough information to decide.  One must refer to the item itself to determine what the 
characters mean, and then romanize accordingly.  For example, 
 
Characters in title / romanization  
refers to 
 
13. 金山龍逰禪寺志略 
 
 
Mountain (referred to the book)  
 
Jin Shan Long you chan si zhi lüe

2G. Terms for archaeological sites, bridges, and other constructions of geographic extent extent 
are capitalized and separated from the names themselves.  Individual syllables of multi-
syllable generic terms are connected together.   
 
 
NOTE: PROPOSED CHANGE:  change the second sentence; the highlighted examples 
have been changed to conform. 
 
 
Individual syllables of multi-syllable generic terms are connected together, as are the 
syllables of the names of a jurisdiction or geographic feature that are included within the 
term. 
 
 
Refer to GEOnet (GNS) to identify generic terms for place names, or do so using one’s 
knowledge of the Chinese language.  Place names should be systematically romanized 
in descriptive strings.  Please note that the romanization in headings may vary from 
systematic form.  For example, 黄壁庄水库is systematically romanized as Huangbi 
Zhuang Shuiku, but the subject heading has been established as Huangbizhuang Dam 
(China), based on the form Huangbizhuang Shuiku, which is recommended by 
GEOnet.

2J. Personal names appearing as part of geographic names are romanized in the same manner as 
all other personal names. 
 
NOTE: PROPOSED CHANGE:  change Section 2J to read as follows; change the 
example, and add two others: 
 
The syllables of personal names that appear within geographic names are connected 
together.  The generic term for the jurisdiction or geographic feature is separated.  
This rule is an exception to Section 1E.
