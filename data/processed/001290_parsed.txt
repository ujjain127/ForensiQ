COMPARISON OF FIELD PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE
SOIL MOISTURE SENSORS IN A SEMI-ARID RANGELAND1
Ginger B. Paige and Timothy O. Keefer2
ABSTRACT: Automated electronic soil moisture sensors, such as time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) and capaci-
tance probes are being used extensively to monitor and measure soil moisture in a variety of scientiﬁc and land
management applications. These sensors are often used for a wide range of soil moisture applications such as
drought forage prediction or validation of large-scale remote sensing instruments. The convergence of three dif-
ferent research projects facilitated the evaluation and comparison of three commercially available electronic soil
moisture probes under ﬁeld application conditions. The sensors are all installed in shallow soil proﬁles in a well
instrumented small semi-arid shrub covered subwatershed in Southeastern Arizona. The sensors use either a
TDR or a capacitance technique; both of which indirectly measure the soil dielectric constant to determine the
soil moisture content. Sensors are evaluated over a range of conditions during three seasons comparing
responses to natural wetting and drying sequences and using water balance and inﬁltration simulation models.
Each of the sensors responded to the majority of precipitation events; however, they varied greatly in response
time and magnitude from each other. Measured proﬁle soil moisture storage compared better to water balance
estimates when soil moisture in deeper layers was accounted for in the calculations. No distinct or consistent
trend was detected when comparing the responses from the sensors or the inﬁltration model to individual pre-
cipitation events. The results underscore the need to understand how the sensors respond under ﬁeld applica-
tion and recognize the limitations of soil moisture sensors and the factors that can affect their accuracy in
predicting soil moisture in situ.

remote
sensing data, irrigation quantity and timing for agri-
cultural crops, water supply calculations, and evalu-
ation of potential drought impacts. Soil moisture
content is an important component of the water bal-
ance and a signiﬁcant factor in both agricultural
and rangeland management. However, because of
the spatial variability of soils and the spatial and
temporal variability of water content in the soil, it
can be difﬁcult to accurately measure, especially at
depth. In response to this need, a wide range of
methods
and
automated
instruments
have
been
developed
to
measure
moisture
content
in
soils.
Measurement
methods
that
have
been
developed
over the years include gravimetric sampling, gypsum
blocks,
neutron
scattering,
and
recently
electro-
magnetic induction methods and probes, such as
TDR and capacitance probes, which measure the
dielectric constant of the soil to determine the soil
moisture content. In most cases, the soil moisture
content is not directly measured but indirectly calcu-
lated from a measurable soil property related to soil
moisture.
Presently,
TDR
and
capacitance
probe
methods
are
the
most
commonly
used
electronic
methods for measuring soil moisture as they can be
automated and can be used to measure both spatial
and temporal changes in soil moisture.
Currently, many electronic probes are being used
for long-term measurement and monitoring of soil
moisture. Examples include the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service
(NRCS) which has installed soil moisture capacitance
probes at more than 100 sites across the country as
part of the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN;
http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/scan/). As many as ﬁve
soil moisture probes are installed in a single proﬁle
at multiple depths at each site. The Wyoming Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in collaboration with the Univer-
sity of Wyoming, has installed soil moisture probes at
18 sites across the state to monitor soil moisture for
drought forage prediction. Again, three capacitance
probes are installed in single proﬁles at each site.
However, the ability of the different probes to mea-
sure effectively soil moisture in situ still needs to be
determined. The factors that can affect electronic
probe performance are the variability of the soil
properties (e.g., bulk density and texture), soil tem-
perature and salinity (Mead et al., 1995), the meas-
urement
frequency (Seyfried
and Murdock,
2001,
2004; Chandler et al., 2004), and even differences
among
individual
sensor
responses
(Seyfried
and
Murdock, 2001; Bosch, 2004; Chandler et al., 2004).
Many capacitance probes are more sensitive to spe-
ciﬁc soil characteristics than TDR probes primarily
because of the differences in measurement frequency
(Chandler et al., 2004; Seyfried and Murdock, 2004).
Most electronic probes come with a factory calibra-
tion; however, a soil speciﬁc calibration is often
needed.
Laboratory evaluation and calibration of electronic
soil moisture probes often result in fairly good perfor-
mance
under
controlled
conditions
(Seyfried
and
Murdock, 2001; Bosch, 2004). Bosch (2004) evaluated
the performance of two capacitance probes (Stevens -
Vitel
Hydra
probe
and
Decagon
Echo
dielectric
aquaprobe) in laboratory and ﬁeld settings. Labora-
tory calibrated probes yielded volumetric soil mois-
ture estimates within ± 0.05 cm3 cm)3 of observed
values. While ﬁeld comparison of the Hydra probe
using factory calibrations resulted in estimates of soil
moisture within ± 75%. Better agreement was found
using soil-speciﬁc calibration or the Topp equation
(Topp et al., 1980). Lieb et al. (2003) compared
several different soil moisture sensors in an agricul-
tural ﬁeld setting to neutron probe readings through
a 90 cm proﬁle. The neutron probe was calibrated
to the speciﬁc site and soil. Their results state that
individual probes must be calibrated to speciﬁc soils
for accurate soil moisture measurements. Chandler
et
al.
(2004)
successfully
used
TDR
calibrated
with the Topp Equation to ﬁeld calibrate capacitance
probes.
Amer
et
al.
(1994)
also
used
calibrated
TDR probes to calibrate successfully the moisture
resistance sensors. However, that process requires
having calibrated TDR installed with selected probes
which is unlikely to happen in most ﬁeld applica-
tions.
Three different commercially available automated
soil moisture sensors are all installed in shallow soil
proﬁles
in
a
well
instrumented
small
semi-arid
shrub covered watershed in Southeastern Arizona.
The soil moisture sensors were installed over a two-
year period as part of three separate and distinct
studies. The sensors use either a capacitance tech-
nique or time domain reﬂectometry to measure the
dielectric constant of the soil. The purpose of this
study is to evaluate and compare the responses of
the three different automated soil moisture sensors
installed in the same semi-arid subwatershed to var-
iable wetting from natural precipitation events. The
measured volumetric water content and the lag time
between precipitation and changes in soil moisture
at a variety of depths in the soil horizon are qualita-
tively evaluated for three seasons. A water balance
model
using
measured
precipitation,
runoff
and
evapotranspiration (ET) to compute changes in soil
moisture storage is compared to soil moisture stor-
age determined from each of the three sensor pro-
ﬁles
for
three
seasons.
An
inﬁltration
model,
parameterized to the speciﬁc watershed, is used to
evaluate the responses to the wetting front for spe-
ciﬁc precipitation events.

Previous studies have looked at the performance of
soil moisture probes as compared with gravimetric
measurements or used TDR to calibrate other capaci-
tance probes; however, few have directly compared
the performance of different probes under ﬁeld appli-
cations as they are being employed for long-term
monitoring of soil moisture. Recently, Walker et al.
(2004) compared a variety of sensors under similar
conditions and found differences in response to wet-
ting. Their study differs from the current in several
respects. The sensors they employed were installed in
a 1 m2 area of soil for the purpose of a comparison
study. Some of the sensors were read at discrete
times, not continuously recorded. In a simple water
balance model, a modeled Penman-Monteith ET was
used and it was assumed there was no drainage
below 40 cm. In this study, because the sensors were
installed for different research programs, they were
installed in separate proﬁles within the same subwa-
tershed within 250 m of each other (Figure 1). Table 1
contains summary information on the installation
locations. All sensors are recorded at 20 min time
intervals. For the water balance model, ET is mea-
sured by Bowen Ratio and wetting front limits are
determined by measurements in the soil proﬁle. It
is important to note that this is an evaluation of
the sensor as they are currently being used in ﬁeld
applications.

and burroweed (Aplopappus tenuisectus). Shrub sur-
face cover is about 25-30% with the remainder of the
area being bare interspace. The soil is a sandy grav-
elly loam (66% sand, 24% silt, 10% clay), with consid-
erable rock content (28%), high surface rock cover
(46%), low organic matter (<1%) and bulk density of
1.64 g⁄cm3 (Kustas and Goodrich, 1994).
A
meteorological
station
with
soil
moisture
measurement capability is maintained at LH as part
of
the
long-term
hydrologic
monitoring
at
WGEW. To monitor the soil moisture, six ML2x
Theta Probes1 (DTP) (Delta-T Devices Ltd., 1999) are
installed at 5 and 15 cm depths in three separate pro-
ﬁles under bare surface, shrub cover and a mixed
bare and shrub cover. All probes are within 2 m hori-
zontally of each other. The probes have been opera-
tional since 2001. An electronic weighing bucket
recording raingauge is located approximately 76 m
west of the meteorological station. In January 2002,
as part of a joint USDA-NASA project (Cosh et al.,
2007) to evaluate remote sensed estimates of near-
surface soil moisture, three Stevens -Vitel Hydra
Probe 1 sensors (VHP) (Stevens Water Monitoring
Systems Inc., 1994) are installed at 5, 15, and 30 cm
depths under bare surface co-located with the rainga-
uge. In collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Labora-
tory and the University of Arizona (Moghaddam
et al., 2003), two proﬁles of TDR probes are installed
188 m southwest of the raingauge in January 2003,
to evaluate the potential of a prototype multi-fre-
quency ground penetrating radar to measure soil
moisture at depth. A TDR100 system (Campbell Sci-
entiﬁc Inc. 2004) is employed to sample the TDR
probes installed at 5, 15, 30, 50, and 75 cm depths.
The probes are installed in two separate proﬁles,
under bare and shrub cover; within two horizontal
meters of each other at each depth. The locations of
all of the soil moisture sensors within the LH subwa-
tershed are presented in Figure 1. The three research
programs are separate and unique, each having its
own speciﬁc requirements for measurement of soil
moisture and selection of sensors; however, several
measurement factors have been kept constant. Data
at all three sites are recorded on Campbell Scientiﬁc
CR10X data loggers at a common 20 min time step.
The installation process was similar for each. A
trench was excavated by hand or backhoe. All probes
were installed into the southern trench face. A small
horizontal cavity, large enough to accept the probe
body, was created in the trench face. Probes were
inserted horizontally into this cavity, by pushing
the probe tines into the soil at the recessed end of the
cavity, until the probe head was within the cavity.
The cavity was repacked with the soil which had
been removed. Probe lead wires were run vertically
down the trench face, across the bottom of the trench
and up the other side, thus preventing preferential
ﬂow paths to probe head and tines. The soil matrix is
very rocky and at the time of the installations of
the VHP and TDR, the soil was extremely dry and
hard because of prolonged drought conditions, often
necessitating that pilot holes be drilled to accept the
probe tines. Although every attempt was made to
assure good contact between soil and tines, it is
impossible to know the extent of soil cracking around
the tines at time of installation.
In addition, other soil moisture proﬁle measure-
ments have been made in proximity to these sites in
the last 15 years by electric resistance sensors (Amer
et al., 1994), TDR (Whitaker, 1993; Hymer et al.,
2000) and capacitance sensors (Thoma et al., 2006). A
USDA-NRCS
Surface
Climate
Analysis
Network
(SCAN) site, in operation since 1999, is adjacent
to the subwatershed (http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/
scan/). Other instrumentation include a concrete H
ﬂume measuring runoff on the 0.35 ha subwatershed
(encompassing ⁄adjacent to the soil moisture instru-
mentation), operated as part of the long-term WGEW
instrumentation network, and a Bowen Ratio (BR)
System, operated as part of the USDA-ARS, Range-
land Carbon Flux Project (Svejcar et al., 1997).
Sensors
All three sensors indirectly measure the dielectric
constant of the soil to determine the soil moisture
content. The dielectric constant is about 1 for air, 5
for dry soil, and 80 for water. Thus, the addition of

water to dry soil causes an increase in the dielectric
constant of the soil. Capacitance sensors measure the
resonance frequency of a circuit where the probe
itself is a capacitor within the circuit. The capaci-
tance sensor consists of two electrodes separated by a
dielectric. When the probe tines are placed in the soil
medium, the soil becomes part of the dielectric. A
high frequency electrical pulse applied to the elec-
trodes causes a resonance frequency to be set up,
which is measured by the sensor. It is this frequency
that changes as the soil’s dielectric constant changes
with moisture content. TDR measures the propaga-
tion velocity of an electric pulse traveling along the
sensor wave guides. The reﬂected signal is a function
of the dielectric constant (Topp et al., 1980).
The DTP generates a 100 MHz signal that is solely
dependent upon the soils apparent dielectric content
while minimizing the inﬂuence of the soils ionic con-
ductivity. Sensor output is 0 to 1 VDC (direct current
volts) for a range of measured dielectric constant
commensurate
with
0-50%
volumetric
water
content (VWC). The manufacturer supplies calibra-
tion equations for mineral and organic soils and esti-
mates accuracies of ± 5% VWC when using the
generalized
equations,
although
better
accuracies
may be achieved with site-speciﬁc calibrations. The
probe consists of a plastic cylinder 11 cm long and
4 cm diameter housing the sensor electronics. Four
6 cm long tines extend longitudinally from one end of
the probe, three in triangular fashion around the
fourth located at the center of the triangle. The
approximate sampling volume is a 6 cm long cylinder
with 4 cm diameter.
The VHP is a capacitance sensor that measures
the soil dielectric constant by generating a 50 MHz
signal. This frequency responds to both the capacitive
and conductive parts of the soil’s electric properties.
The former is related to soil moisture and the latter
to soil salinity. The probe also has an integrated
thermistor to measure soil temperature. The sensor
outputs four voltages ranging from 0-2.5 VDC. The
ﬁrst, second, and third voltages are used to determine
the dielectric constant and the fourth is used to
determine temperature. Software supplied by the
manufacturer contains algorithms to resolve the real
and
imaginary
parts
of
the
dielectric
constant
(respectively corresponding to the capacitive and con-
ductive parts of the soil electric response), the soil
temperature, temperature corrected real and imagi-
nary dielectric components and soil moisture and soil
salinity. Soil moisture is calculated from one of three
calibrations based upon generic soil type: sand, silt or
clay. The manufacturer’s stated accuracy is ± 3%
VWC. The probe head is a plastic cylinder about 4 cm
long and 4 cm diameter housing sensor electronics.
Four 6 cm long tines extend from one end of the
probe, three in triangular fashion around the fourth
located at the center of the triangle. The approximate
sampling volume is a 6 cm long cylinder with 2.5 cm
diameter.
The TDR system uses the Campbell Scientiﬁc
TDR100, a data logger controlled pulsed signal gener-
ator. The TDR100 samples reﬂected waveforms which
are dependent on the velocity of the generated signal,
the length of the waveguides, and the dielectric con-
stant of the soil medium. Software supplied with the
unit allows user-determined control settings for oper-
ation of the TDR100 and signal interpretation. Two
relationships between apparent dielectric constant
and VWC are provided and are nearly equivalent for
a range of soil water contents and applications. The
Topp equation (Topp et al., 1980) is a polynomial
expression relating the dielectric constant to soil
moisture. The Ledieu (Ledieu et al., 1986) calibration
linearly relates VWC to the square root of apparent
dielectric constant. The probe consists of a plastic
head which holds the coaxial cable connection to the
two parallel 15 cm long stainless steel wave guides,
separated by 4 cm. The effective sampling volume is
estimated to be a cylinder 15 cm long and 4 cm dia-
meter.
A site-speciﬁc calibration is needed for most soil
moisture sensors, although the manufacturers sup-
plied calibration equations are often acceptable espe-
cially when the soil type is easily classiﬁed as sand,
silt, or clay. It is difﬁcult to obtain accurate calibra-
tions from soils with high rock content, such as those
at LH, either in situ or in a laboratory using soils
removed from the site and packed to appropriate bulk
density. Because of the rock content and the unstable
nature of the soil when removed by coring, exacer-
bated when the soil is extremely dry, this is often
impractical. For these installations, the mineral soil
calibration provided by the manufacturer was used
for DTP; the Ledieu equation with site-speciﬁc cali-
bration coefﬁcients was used for TDR; and the manu-
facturers supplied calibration for sand soil was used
for VHP.
RESULTS
Seasonal Soil Moisture Patterns
Correlations between sensors of the same type and
between the different types of sensors were calculated
for average daily VWC. For the DTP, correlations
were calculated between sensors at the same depth, 5
or 15 cm, under the three covers. For TDR correla-
tions
were
calculated

same depth, 5, 15, or 30 cm, under bare and shrub
cover covers. Because the VHP proﬁle has no replica-
tion, the sensors were correlated to the same type of
sensor located at the NRCS SCAN site approximately
125 m east of the VHP proﬁle for 5 and 15 cm depths.
Correlation coefﬁcients, r, are given in Tables 2
and 3. Correlation for intra-sensor comparisons range
from 0.83 to 0.99 for DTP, 0.92 to 0.97 for TDR and
0.82 and 0.87 for VHP. The correlation of the 5 cm
VHP probes under bare surface cover, but removed
by 125 m, was about the same as the correlation
between two DTP under shrub and bare cover but
separated by 2 m. Whitaker (1993) found negligible
differences between soil moisture under shrub and
bare cover at this watershed. Inter-sensor compari-
sons were done between DTP and TDR at 5 and
15 cm for bare and shrub cover, between VHP and
DTP at 5 and 15 cm and between VHP and TDR at 5,
15, and 30 cm for bare cover only. Correlations for
inter-sensor comparisons range from 0.81 to 0.94
under bare cover and from 0.76 to 0.83 for shrub
cover. The variability of actual soil moisture at this
watershed has been documented. Whitaker (1993),
using TDR, reported spatial correlation length of
0.70 m based on a one-time sample of 51 data points
spaced 0.10 m apart within 1 m2. These data were
collected during a longer and larger sampling which
suggested spatial correlation lengths of 100 m for
samples at 5 m spacing, over a 4 ha area. Thoma
et al. (2006) suggests that with sufﬁcient samples a
1000 m2 area can represent a 1 ha area. Because the
VHP proﬁle is located under bare cover only, and the
correlations of the various inter-sensor comparisons
are within the range of the intra-sensor comparisons
the following analysis uses only sensors located under
bare surface cover.
Three separate time periods were selected for com-
parison and analysis from the 18 months of common
operation,
Winter03,
Summer03
and
Winter04
(Table 4). Common to all sensors was a diurnal ﬂuc-
tuation of about 1-2% VWC that appeared to decrease
with depth, and therefore was considered a function
of temperature ﬂuctuation at the sensor head, sensor
lead, or data logger. The 5 cm VHP soil moisture
reading is about 0.05 less than the DTP and TDR
during all three periods except in response to precipi-
tation events. The responses of all three sensors to
soil wetting through the proﬁle from precipitation
events and subsequent drying from evaporation and
transpiration and the intra-proﬁle redistribution of
water are qualitatively discussed.
During Winter03 and Summer03, the VHP at 5
and 15 cm tended to respond to precipitation events
more immediately and to a greater extent than TDR
and DTP. DTP tended to respond slower, remain ele-
vated longer and decrease slower than TDR and
VHP. During Winter03, the VHP showed a response
at 30 cm for which the TDR did not and there was no
TDR response at 50 or 75 cm. During Summer03,
there was no response by VHP and TDR at 30 cm or
below. During Winter04, all 5 cm (Figure 2a) and
15 cm sensors responded equally fast to their maxi-
mum
soil
moisture
after
precipitation,
but
DTP
remained elevated longer. At 30 cm (Figure 2b), both
VHP and TDR respond similarly. An increase in
moisture was measured at 50 cm, but not at 75 cm,
by the TDR.

variances (Haan, 1977) between each pair of sensors

at each depth for each season were performed using t
and F-tests (alpha = 0.05; n = 8640, 4536, and 8640
for
Winter03,
Summer03,
and

respec-
tively). In 39 of 42 cases, the hypotheses of equiva-
lence were rejected (p-values < 0.002). In effect, the
measured
soil
moisture
is
signiﬁcantly
different
among the three types of sensors when evaluating
their response to seasonal soil moisture ﬂuxes.
Sensor Proﬁle Soil Moisture Storage
The total volume of soil moisture through the pro-
ﬁle was calculated to examine if there were similari-
ties among the three proﬁles. Soil moisture storage
measured in each proﬁle was calculated as the sum
of the soil water per depth interval through the pro-
ﬁle. A simple moving average ﬁlter was applied to
the data to eliminate diurnal ﬂuctuations. The three
proﬁles were 0-20 cm determined for each sensor type

0-40 cm determined from the weighted mean of the
VHP and TDR sensors at 5, 15, and 30 cm with
weights 1⁄4, 1⁄4, and 1⁄2 respectively; and 0-60 cm
determined from the weighted mean of the TDR sen-
sors at 5, 15, 30, and 50 cm with weights 1⁄6, 1⁄6,
1⁄3, and 1⁄3, respectively.
During Winter03 (Figure 3a), from DOY 40 to
DOY
60,
as
precipitation
occurred
the
storage
increased nearly equivalently in all deﬁned layers.
After DOY 60, declines in storage deviated between
two subsets of proﬁles, one being the 0-20 cm DTP
and 0-40 cm VHP; the other being the 0-20 cm VHP,
0-20 cm TDR and 0-40 cm TDR. By DOY 160, four of
these were nearly equivalent; only the 0-20 DTP was
slightly higher, which was a result of the DTP read-
ings at 5 and 15 cm remaining higher during the dry
down periods. A similar distinction was seen in Sum-
mer03 between the 0-20 cm DTP and 0-40 cm VHP
on one hand and 0-20 cm VHP, 0-20 cm TDR and
0-40 cm TDR on the other. The 5 mm difference
between the 0-20 and 0-40 VHP, starting about DOY
213 and continuing to DOY 260, was a result of the
2-3% increase in VWC
at 30 cm. The 0-20 and
0-40 cm TDR track identically because there was no
measurable change in soil moisture at 30 cm. In Win-
ter04 (Figure 3b), two distinct subsets were evident;
in this case, the difference was deﬁned by depth and
not by sensor. Initially, the 0-20 and 0-40 cm storages
increased identically until about DOY 60. However,
soon after, the 0-20 cm proﬁles’ storages deviated
from those at 0-40 cm as inﬁltration and redistribu-
tion to 30 and 50 cm occurred, doubling VWC at
30 cm. It is unclear why the storages converged for
the distinct depths during this period but not in the
previous periods. It could be that the TDR probes had

ﬁnally equilibrated to the soil after one year of instal-
lation; however, this does not explain the shift in the
DTP relative to the 0-20 cm VHP and TDR.
Hypothesis tests, t-tests and F-tests (alpha = 0.05;
n = 120, 63, and 120 for Winter03, Summer03, and
Winter04, respectively) of the equivalence of means
and variances of the daily soil moisture storage were
conducted for each pair of sensors, for each season,
for two depths 0-20 and 0-40 cm. For Winter03, ﬁve
of eight cases of equivalence were rejected; for Sum-
mer03, six of eight cases of equivalence were rejected.
For Winter04, only one of eight tests of equivalence
was rejected, all other pairs of means and variances
were equivalent. These results support the conver-
gence of storage among sensors and divergence of
storage between depths shown in Figure 3b. Table 5
contains p-values of the hypotheses tests.
Water Balance Model
A simple water balance model was used to esti-
mate the soil water storage for each of the three sea-
sonal
periods.
One
of
the
compelling
needs
for
reliable in situ measurement of soil moisture is to
improve the ability to determine the water balance in
critical areas of concern. The two components of the
water balance that are most difﬁcult to measure are
ET and soil moisture storage. In this case, there was
a unique opportunity to evaluate the three different
soil moisture sensors within a well instrumented sub-
watershed where all of the major components of the
water balance including runoff and ET are being
measured. The objective was to evaluate which sensor
soil moisture proﬁle most closely matched the water
balance model results. The change in daily proﬁle soil
moisture storage was solved as a residual in the
water balance equation.
dS
dt ¼ P ET Q  G;
where G is ground-water recharge in mm (assumed
to be equal to 0), Q is watershed area runoff dis-
charge in mm, ET is the ET in mm, P is the precipi-
tation in mm, and dS is the change in proﬁle storage
in mm with respect to time, in this case one day.
The model assumes that there is no ground-water
recharge on these rangeland hillslopes, which is con-
sistent with previous ﬁndings (Renard et al., 1993).
Precipitation was measured with an electronic weigh-
ing bucket digital recording raingauge, with accuracy
to 0.25 mm in one min. Watershed runoff was mea-
sured by an H ﬂume (USDA, 1979) located on a
0.35 ha watershed in proximity to all three soil mois-
ture sites. On WGEW, runoff occurs primarily in
summer from high intensity, convective thunder-
storms, where precipitation intensity often exceeds
the inﬁltration capacity. On small upland water-
sheds, such as LH, the runoff may be on the order of
10-20% of rainfall during this period (Osborn and
Lane, 1969). Summer03, with a total precipitation
from DOY 198-260 of 126 mm, resulted in nine runoff
events with total runoff across the LH subwatershed
of 25 mm. ET was determined by a BR system (Em-
merich, 2003).
Each element of the water balance model intro-
duces some error or uncertainty. The Lucky Hills
watershed study area has several recording raingaug-
es. Raingauge data used in this study were compared
to those of two similar raingauges. The coefﬁcient of
variation of total rainfall for each period was 0.01,
0.02, and 0.006 and the absolute difference in total
rainfall between the mean and the study raingauge
was 0.08, 2.16, and 0.55 mm for Winter03, Sum-
mer03, and Winter04, respectively. Osborn et al.
(1972) estimated that for a correlation of at least 0.9
at WGEW raingauges should be within 549 m for
total storm depth and 305 m for peak 15 min inten-
sity. These three raingauges are within 250 m of each
other. Freimund (1992) evaluated errors of similar ra-
ingauges and ﬂumes on a semi-arid watershed in
southeast Arizona. Combined random and systematic
errors could be as high as 10% for precipitation and
somewhat higher for runoff. However, that analysis
made recommendations to eliminate much of the
error, most of which has been accomplished by elec-
tronic measurement and digital recording of data. A
conservative estimate of uncertainty in precipitation
and runoff at LH would be 5%. Measurement of ET
by the BR method may overestimate daily ET by
20%, as will be discussed below. Some error is intro-
duced in the calculation of soil moisture storage.

Manufacturer’s estimation of accuracy of the soil
moisture sensors, given in Table 1. are about 3-5%.
The assumption of spatial averaging of point to pro-
ﬁle soil water storage is systematically applied to all
sensor proﬁles and it is not part of the water balance
calculation.
Initially, during Winter03 (Figure 4a), the water
balance model predicted a similar increase in storage
as the sensor proﬁles. By DOY 60, as the sensor pro-
ﬁles diverged into the two aforementioned subsets,
the water balance decreased at a rate and level
between the two subsets, until DOY 100 when the
reduction in storage from the model exceeded both
sensor subsets. As the sensor readings reached mini-
mum of VWC and daily changes in storage became
zero, the model continued to predict decreases in
storage, which effectively forces water content to 2%
by DOY 160. Gravimetric samples of 5 cm soil mois-
ture taken DOY 136 of 2003 measured about 2%
VWC. The 5 cm VWC measured by VHP from DOY
100–160 were about 1% or 2%, but VWC was higher
at depth.
During Summer03, initial increases to storage are
commensurate
with
those
calculated
from
sensor
measurements. However, by DOY 220 the modeled
cumulative storage was below all of the sensor proﬁled
storages and continued that way to the end of the per-
iod. Similar to Winter03, the reduction in storage from
DOY 239-260 was considerably greater than the
reductions from the sensors and is of such magnitude
that soil moisture converted from storage to VWC
would
be
equivalent
to
zero.
During
Winter04
(Figure 4b) the sensor and model storages tracked
very nearly the same for the three deeper storage
depths. Reductions in storage were very similar from
DOY 95 to about DOY 124. By that time the sensor
storage estimates for all depths converged to unchang-
ing conditions based upon VWC for each sensor and
reached a minimum of about 3% for 5 cm and 8% for
15 cm. However, as in the previous two periods, the
model estimate of storage continued to decrease. This
decrease of 20 mm was much greater than the maxi-
mum 6 mm decrease from the sensor storage estimate.
For the winter seasons, it is illustrative to consider
that from DOY 78 to DOY 191 in 2003 and from DOY
101 to DOY 172 in 2004 there was no measurable
precipitation. Measured soil moisture storage ceased
to change by about DOY 140 in both years. However,
the water balance model indicated continued reduc-
tions in soil moisture storage by about 10 mm in
2003 and 15 mm in 2004. From the model structure,
losses from soil moisture storage could be from drain-
age to depth or from ET as measured by BR. Soil
moisture changes measured by VHP and TDR indi-
cate that there was no moisture draining below 30 in
2003 or below 50 cm in 2004. Hence the loss of soil
water is likely to be to ET. This poses a problem in
that the reductions of soil water predicted by BR are
greater than the water available as measured by the
sensors.
Earlier work reported by Kustas et al. (1994),
Stannard et al. (1994) and Houser et al. (1998) have
shown high variability in measured or calculated val-
ues of ET among a variety of methods, including eddy
covariance, BR, Delta-T and Sigma-T on this same
watershed. Keefer et al. (1997) assumed that mea-
sured ET could be reduced by a factor of 0.1-0.15
based on overestimates of nighttime ET at this and a
nearby watershed. Houser et al. (1998) showed a 20%
overestimation of ET by BR when compared to a
water balance model. Therefore, a second estimate of
the water balance uses a value of 0.8 of ET measured
by BR to algebraically solve for the change in mois-
ture storage (dS).

original model during the precipitation period, but
closely tracks the 0-20 cm DTP and 0-40 VHP storage
estimates during the drying phase. The empirically
reduced ET delayed and reduced the estimation of
storage reduction of the original model. During Sum-
mer03, after the initial reduction in storage following
the storage increase because of precipitation, the two-
model results diverged, bracketing the sensor storage
estimates for the duration of the period. Reductions
in storage from the revised water balance model were
not as great as the ﬁrst model results; the VWC val-
ues did not go to zero but to about 4%, closer to the
sensor average estimate of about 6-8% in the 5 and
15 cm depths. In the Winter04 period (Figure 4b), the
revised model storage was similar to the original
model and the deeper sensor proﬁle estimates, until
about DOY 95 when the reduced ET model began to
underpredict storage reduction relative to the sensor
estimates and the original model. However, by DOY
172 the revised model storage was equivalent to all
sensor estimates and about 20 mm greater than the
original model storage estimate.
Comparing the integrated depth sensor results
with those of the revised water balance model, there
were differences among the three seasons. For Win-
ter03 and Summer03, the results from the integrated
VHP 0-40 cm measurements were the best at track-
ing the revised water balance model. However, for
Winter04,
the
integrated
results
from
the
TDR
0-60 cm were the best at tracking the original water
balance model. The primary factor that appears to
inﬂuence the integrated sensor results to match the
water balance model was the ability to account for
changes in soil moisture at depth. For the Summer03,
the VHP measured increases in VWC at 30 cm while
the TDR saw no changes in VWC at 30 cm. In Win-
ter04, the TDR 0-40 cm and the VHP 0-40 cm were
almost identical. However, the TDR 0-60 cm, matched
the revised water balance model better as it was able
to account for increases in VWC at 50 cm.
Inﬁltration Model
A more detailed view of the inﬁltration and redis-
tribution of soil moisture at depth can be seen by con-
sidering
individual
precipitation
events
and
the
responses of the sensors. Additional analysis of the
ability of the sensors to measure the changes in soil
moisture content within the proﬁle was conducted
using a one-dimensional numerical simulation model.
A subset of three precipitation events were selected
from the periods of study and evaluated using an
inﬁltration model. Three distinct storm types were
selected for the modeling: a low intensity, medium
duration single storm (DOY 51 2003); a high inten-
sity, short duration storm (DOY 206 2003); and a low
intensity,
long
duration
(multiple-event)
storm
(DOY93-94 2004) (Table 6). The storm on DOY 206,
2003 followed a storm of 24 mm on DOY 205 so the
initial soil moisture conditions were wet; 15-17 %
VWC at the 5 cm depth.
HYDRUS-1D version 7.0 (Simunek et al., 2003) was
used to model the inﬁltration process and evaluate the
changes in soil moisture within the proﬁle during and
after the precipitation events. The model is a useful
tool for predicting water and solute movement in the
vadose zone and analyzing laboratory or ﬁeld experi-
ments involving water ﬂow. Scott et al. (2000) used
the HYDRUS model (version 6.0) to model recharge
processes at LH and another subwatershed at WGEW.
Two different soil model parameter estimation meth-
ods were used to estimate the soil moisture distribu-
tion at the two sites and the potential for recharge
below the root zone. At that time, soil moisture data
at the two sites were only available on a biweekly or
monthly time step. For this study, soil moisture data
are available at a 20 min time step; therefore, the
measured soil moisture content from the three sensor
datasets are compared to model output at each sensor
installed depth for individual events.
HYDRUS-1D is a numerical simulation model that
solves for variably saturated one-dimensional ﬂow of
water,
heat
and
solutes
through
porous
media.
HYDRUS uses the Richards’ equation for simulating
variably saturated ﬂow and Fickian-based convection-
dispersion equations for heat and solute transport.
The water ﬂow equation incorporates a sink term to
account for water uptake by plant roots. The govern-
ing ﬂow equation, Richards’ equation, can be deﬁned

(L3L)3T)1). The hydraulic conductivity is a function
of the pressure head, the van Genuchten soil reten-
tion parameters (Van Genuchten, 1980), and the
saturated
hydraulic
conductivity
Ks
(LT)1).
The
hydraulic conductivity function is derived from a
pore-size distribution model (Mualem, 1976). Though
the model can simulate heat and solute transport
and includes provisions for nonlinear, non-equilib-
rium reactions between the solid and liquid phases,
only water ﬂow in the liquid phase was simulated
in this study.
Richards’ equation is solved numerically using a
variable time step and deﬁned initial and boundary
conditions. The required model input parameters are
residual soil moisture (hr), saturated soil moisture
(hs), van Genuchten parameters n and a, and Ks. In
2002, soil cores were extracted from a nearby location
within the LH subwatershed. The model was para-
meterized using the soil retention, hydraulic conduc-
tivity
and
van
Genuchten
parameter
values
determined
from
soil
cores
(Schapp
and
Shouse,
2003). The upper boundary was set to atmospheric
boundary condition with surface runoff and the lower
boundary condition was set to free drainage at a
depth of 200 cm. The observed precipitation was used
to parameterize the variable ﬂux surface boundary
for each simulated event. The model initial conditions
were determined from the measured TDR soil mois-
ture values. The hydraulic parameters used as input
in the model are presented in Table 7. The minimum
time step (0.001 s) was the same for all simulations,
though the actual time step and duration varied for
each simulation (Table 6).
The results from the simulation results were evalu-
ated during and following each event. It is important
to note that the model was not calibrated for this
analysis. The model input parameters were deter-
mined from the soil core analysis and were not
altered to match the measurement results. This was
necessary for two reasons. This alleviated having to
select one from three different calibrations and facili-
tated
comparison
all
of
the
sensor
responses
to
changes in soil moisture with those determined by
the model. The observed TDR measurements were
used to initialize the model as they cover the greatest
depth in the soil proﬁle. This fact is taken into
account when analyzing the results from all three
sensors.
Sensor and Model Storm Response
Differences in the characteristics of the precipita-
tion events are reﬂected in both the measured and
modeled responses. The results from two smaller
storms (DOY 51 and DOY 206) were similar in that
changes in soil moisture were seen only at the 5 and
15 cm depths (Figures 5 and 6). For the larger DOY
93 event, changes in VWC were seen at 30 cm and
below by the model and both the TDR and VHP sen-
sors (Figure 7a and b). However, differences among
the sensors and the model responses can be seen for
all three events.
In general, there were differences in both the
response time and the peak water contents when
comparing the results from the sensors and the model
for all three storms (Figures 5-7). The 5 cm VHP was
always the ﬁrst sensor to respond; however, it did not
always record the highest VWC. The 5 cm VHP had
the highest sensor VWC for DOY 206, while 5 cm
TDR and DTP, though slower to respond had the
highest VWC for the DOY 51 and DOY 93 storms,
respectively. The 5 cm hydrus model had the highest

VWC for DOY 206 storm (Figure 6a and b). For the
DOY 51 storm, the only sensor response at 15 cm
was the VHP, which increased to 20% VWC (13%
increase). This over-measure of VWC by VHP at
15 cm occurred periodically over the course of the
study at the advent of wetting. A potential explana-
tion is that there is preferential ﬂow or a change in
the bulk density in the vicinity of the VHP proﬁle.
However,
the
hydrus
model
did
show
a
slight
increase (3%) in VWC at this depth. Though this is
the same percent increase as the VHP at 15 cm, the
timing and type of the response was very different
(Figure 5).
As there is no known value of VWC to which to
compare the measurement and model responses, the
results were evaluated relative to each other. The
percent deviation of each measured or modeled value
from the average of all the values (sensor and model)
for a given time step and depth was calculated. The
percent deviation for each value was compared to the
calculated coefﬁcient of variability (CV). Figures 8(a
and b) and 9 (a, b and c) show the average VWC, CV,
and percent deviations for different depths from DOY
51 and DOY 93, respectively. No consistent relation-
ship among the sensor or the model responses was
found when comparing the results, though there are
some strong trends. The VHP at 5 cm was lower than
the calculated CV for both events, indicating an un-
derprediction in VWC. For DOY 51, 5 cm (Figure 8a),
the VHP response was signiﬁcantly lower than the
CV for the majority of the 23 h period and consis-
tently lower after ﬁve h while the DTP was signiﬁ-
cantly
lower
during
the
ﬁrst
ﬁve h.
At
15 cm
(Figure 8b), only the VHP signiﬁcantly exceeded the
calculated CV. For event DOY 51, only the results
from the HYDRUS model were within the bounds of
the calculated CV. However, in examining the results
from DOY93 (Figure 9a-c), the results from the model
were much higher than the CV at hour 20 at the
15 cm depth and slightly higher at 30 cm. However,
it is important to note that the results from the TDR
were within the bounds of the calculated CV for all
three depths for event DOY 93.
DISCUSSION

installed for long-term monitoring of soil moisture
were evaluated. The measured changes in soil mois-
ture as a result of precipitation events were compared
to each other and to water balance and inﬁltration
model results. Over the three season period, there
were notable differences in the responses among the
sensors.
Accounting
for
soil
moisture
at
depth
appears to improve proﬁle soil moisture storage esti-
mates in comparison to water balance estimates.
There was a large variation in both storm type and
in measured sensor response. However, no distinct or
consistent trend was detected when comparing the
responses from the sensors or the inﬁltration model
to individual precipitation events.
In general, though there were differences among
measurements at the various depths, the VHP at
5 cm consistently responded more quickly and often
to a much higher VWC than the other sensors. The
responses from the DTP, on the other hand, were
consistently lower and often lagged behind the other
sensors in response time. The characteristics of the
responses from the TDR seemed to change over the
course of the study. There was a noticeable improve-
ment
when
comparing
the
differences
in
TDR
responses
from
Winter03
and
Winter04
for
both
water balance model and the individual events. This
may be attributable to settling, indicating an adjust-
ment time may be necessary to consider before reli-
able measurements can be expected. Assumptions
were made regarding both the parameterization of
the inﬁltration model and the calibrations for the
sensors both near the surface and at depth. However,
the primary problem that still remains is how to ver-
ify⁄validate the measured changes in soil moisture
content. The uncalibrated numerical model, in most
cases, performed as well as the sensors in tracking
the changes in soil moisture in response to individual
precipitation events.
The signiﬁcant differences in measured soil mois-
ture may be due to many factors other than sensor
error including spatial variability of precipitation,
soils, inﬁltration, ground cover and biological activity.
Inﬁltration (Paige and Stone, 1997) and soil moisture
(Whitaker, 1993) vary at submeter distances in this
watershed. Whitaker using a single sample set on a
1 m by 1 m plot found correlation length scale of
70 cm, but using 5 m grid for 4 sampling dates
showed spatial correlation of 100 m. Precipitation
variability can be measured and affects runoff at sub-
hectare scales at this watershed (Faures et al., 1995)
Although a soil type can be considered representative
at this scale, variations do occur through the soil pro-
ﬁle. Thoma et al. (2006) suggest the number of sam-
ples needed to reduce variability is about 50 per
hectare for surface soil samples. That would be 500
samples for a 10 ha area not including measurements
at depth. Destructive gravimetric sampling at that
scale would alter the watershed area if repeated fre-
quently and the cost, installation and monitoring of
automated systems at that scale would be prohibitive.

COMPARISON OF FIELD PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE SOIL MOISTURE SENSORS IN A SEMI-ARID RANGELAND
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION

This watershed installation, with the variety of sen-
sors and the additional beneﬁcial infrastructure in a
small area, offers a unique opportunity to evaluate
and compare the range of sensor responses that most
land management applications cannot duplicate. A
similarly sized rangeland or pasture would use only a
few soil moisture sensors in most applications.
CONCLUSION
The development of electronic soil moisture sensors
has facilitated long-term, remote monitoring of soil
moisture proﬁles. The convergence of three different
research projects facilitated the evaluation and com-
parison of three commercially available electronic soil
moisture probes under ﬁeld application conditions.
This
analysis
showed
that
each
sensor
responds
differently
to
precipitation.
Sensor
response
and
resulting VWC are affected by the sensor type as well
as variability in soil and precipitation. In addition, no
signiﬁcant difference was found when comparing sen-
sor responses to precipitation events and to an uncal-
ibrated inﬁltration model. However, the soil moisture
sensor data presented in this study and data from
similar application have been used effectively for sev-
eral different hydrologic applications and evaluations.
In this study, the soil moisture data showed that
using sensor proﬁle soil moisture to measure soil
moisture
water
balance
storage
is
improved
by
accounting for ‘‘deeper’’ soil moisture. In addition, the
data from all of the sensors have been used for calcu-
lating water balance, ET, and as input to hydrologic
models (Moran et al., 2006; Thoma et al., 2006;
Moran et al., In, review). The VHP data were used to
calibrate remote sensing data for the SMEX (Soil
Moisture Experiments) project (Cosh et al., 2007) and
continue to be used for hydrologic studies at WGEW
and at SCAN sites across the United States. How-
ever, in all cases, it has been critical to identify and
when possible quantify the constraints associated
with the soil moisture data. The results of this analy-
sis underscore the need to recognize the limitations
of soil moisture sensors and the factors that can
affect
their
accuracy
in
predicting
soil
moisture
in situ.
