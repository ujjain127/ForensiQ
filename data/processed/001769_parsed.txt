Our studies have signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the conventionally held view of the phase diagram of
La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7− for two compositions exhibiting charge and orbital order CO, i.e., at hole-doping
levels, h=x−, of 0.5 and 0.6. These CO states are stable over very narrow doping ranges h
 0.005 at the lowest temperatures, but those ranges increase at higher temperatures to h 0.02 in a
manner consistent with simple entropy considerations. Such narrow ranges dictate the crucial need for crystal
homogeneity. Attesting to such homogeneity is a conductivity ratio of 1010 upon crossing the ﬁrst-order
phase boundary from CO at h=0.60 to A-type antiferromagnetic AAFM at h0.59 or h0.61 plus two
ﬁndings that were missed in the existing literature: that these CO phases are the ground state at the lowest
temperatures, and for h0.5, that coexistence of the CO and AAFM phase is absent at any temperature.

Reduced dimensionality can aid the quest to better under-
stand strongly correlated electrons since its reduction of the
mean-ﬁeld ordering temperature can expose competing inter-
actions through more prominent ﬂuctuations. For manga-
nites1 there is a vigorous competition among orbital,
charge,
and
spin
order;
and
in
bilayer
compounds,2
La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7−, this competition is readily apparent in
the ﬂuctuations seen in the paramagnetic PM insulator
phases above their ordering temperatures.3 For example the
PM phase for hole doping, h=x−0.4, reveals charge4 and
polaronic5 ﬂuctuations competing with ferromagnetic FM
spin ﬂuctuations6 that eventually win out at its Curie point.
The backbone of such scientiﬁc inquiry is to establish the
ground states across the accessible range of h that include3
fully FM spin order, two versions of A-type antiferromag-
netic AAFM order FM monolayers with AFM orientation
within the bilayer and for h0.3, FM bilayers with AFM
orientation between them, charge and orbital ordered CO
states “checkerboard” ordering with the CE-type magnetic
order7 for h0.5 and more complex CO for h0.6 and
0.67, and a variety3 of other types of AFM order for h
0.67.
Here we emphasize the narrow, needlelike regions in the
phase diagram of Fig. 1: the CO phase at h0.5 was re-
ported previously8 and we now report a systematic study for
the CO phase found for h0.6. These CO phases appear to
interrupt and replace the “background” AAFM that otherwise
would exist continuously from h0.48 to at least h0.61.
Previous to Ref. 8, it had been commonly accepted that CO
at h=0.5 was re-entrant,9–15 forming below 210 K, but
then being replaced by an AAFM below 100 K. This lack
of a low-temperature CO ground state was surprising as it is
found at h=0.5 in many perovskite manganites.16 In bilayer
manganites, coexistence of CO and AAFM between 100
and 200 K had also been universally reported.9–12,14 To
reveal the intrinsic behavior8 required a high degree of crys-
tal homogeneity that was veriﬁed through the use of multi-
terminal transport measurements see the Appendix that
critically evaluate homogeneity and provide feedback to
crystal growth. Such results for h0.5 showed that the CO
phase does exist at low temperatures and no coexistence was
found.8
The following 1 presents experiments that systemati-
cally map the qualitative features of the needlelike phase for
h0.6; 2 presents experiments directly addressing oxygen
nonstoichiometry; 3 presents a simpliﬁed entropy argument
to support the qualitative shape of the needlelike phases; 4
reports the transport properties of pure CO crystals at h
=0.6; and 5 frames some unanswered questions exposed by
new features in the modiﬁed phase diagram.
A review of our methodology to provide adequate crystal
homogeneity is given in the Appendix, but it is important to
emphasize that homogeneity is a separate issue from abso-

manganite, La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7. The needlelike CO phase at
h=x−d=0.5 was reported recently Ref. 8 and that for the CO
phase at 0.6 is reported here. The ab-plane-metallic A-type AFM
phase occurs at Ref. 24 h0.58 and Ref. 19 h0.59 and here
reported for h0.61. The upper limit of h for this ab-plane metal is
unknown and the lower limit is poorly known. The previously re-
ported bilayer phases for h0.48, FM metal, canted FM CFM,
and AFM-oriented FM bilayers, are indicated for completeness. We
presently have insufﬁcient data to establish the potentially interest-
ing detailed behavior in the vicinity of h0.46, where the FM
metallic and AAFM insulator phases collide, or near h0.55 or for
h0.61.

lute hole-doping level, h. For a nominal Sr doping in the
polycrystalline feed rod, x0 an obvious abbreviation for the
actual Sr content per formula unit, 1+2x0, the ﬁrst crystal-
lization in the ﬂoating zone is known17 to occur at xx0 for
La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7−. In the following, we assume there are
no instabilities during growth; then x rises and settles to x0
by the central part of the boule, and if growth is continued to
the end of the feed rod, the last zone length will compensate
with xx0. Thus, x0 is inadequate for determining the Sr
doping, x, of individual crystals extracted from the boule. It
is especially unreliable if growth instabilities interrupt the
above scenario, but variable oxygen nonstoichiometry, ,
could also contribute to uncertainties in h=x−. Consistent
with our own experience, the reports of others9–15,18 show
widely variable properties for nominal “x0=0.5.” Consider-
ing the precision on h that is needed, we have not found
adequate nondestructive, or even destructive, quantitative
analyses e.g., energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and in-
ductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy are
accurate to 2–3% at best. Thus only a qualitative hole-
doping scale, based on the measured physical properties, was
used in Ref. 8. Due to the difﬁculty of quantifying h and x, in
our samples, or those in literature, the following nomencla-
ture will be adopted. Clearly by x0 we mean the starting or
nominal composition of the boule, and it is the only infor-
mation we have for data from the literature and many of our
crystals. The actual x is most likely smaller than, but cer-
tainly not greater than, x0 for stable growth. As our slow-cool
protocol precludes negative , the actual h is most likely
smaller than, but not greater than, x. Our use of h, x, or x0
throughout the paper reﬂects either the most physically rel-
evant one for the discussion at hand or the “best”—or only—
known value. We now discuss our control of x and  in turn.
A compelling realization of the qualitative doping-
dependent phase diagram of CO states is reported here for
hhCO=0.6, even if it is still only semiquantitative. In this
experiment, the nominal Sr composition, x0, of the polycrys-
talline feed rod was 0.61, and growth proceeded without in-
stabilities until a crack formed near the very end. Eleven
samples were extracted from various positions along the re-
sulting boule see top of Fig. 2 and their transitions mea-
sured by magnetization. In earlier works we showed8,19 the
equivalence of magnetization, transport, and x rays for iden-
tifying CO. Such transition temperatures are plotted in Fig. 2
as a linear function of crystal number 1–11 and not distance
along the boule. The data that precede these on the plot came
from two samples extracted19 from a boule with x0=0.60,
and they have been assigned a qualitative position based on
their transition temperatures. An additional data point for
x0=0.58 shows a single, direct transition from PM to AAFM.
The abscissa of Fig. 2 is clearly a qualitative scale of h, but
some ﬁxed points can be assigned. The ﬁnal three samples
9–11 exhibit barely distinguishable transition temperatures
and span about a third of the boule length. It is reasonable to
assign these to x=x0=0.61, while the three samples 4–6
that do not show the AAFM phase at low temperature are
strongly expected to represent the CO state centered at hCO
=0.60.
Then based on the data of Fig. 2, one can imagine that
crystals reported in literature may be inadvertently under-
doped, i.e., x less than the nominally quoted x0. The amount
of underdoping, which can be as much as 0.02 or possibly
more, is estimated from the data of Fig. 2 for h0.6 by
assuming a reasonably symmetric effect on transition tem-
peratures with h−hCO. Extrapolating this trend to nominal
“x0=0.5” doping could begin to explain the widely variable
properties reported,8–15,18 and why, if the initial part of the
boule were used, the resulting range of doping could simu-
late coexistence.
We now address oxygen nonstoichiometry. The bilayer
manganites seem to be far less susceptible to oxygen non-
stoichiometry than perovskite manganites, and recent studies
ﬁnd20 for polycrystalline x=0.4 samples that , “which was
controlled by postannealing and quenching,” was 0.005 us-
ing temperatures in the range of 600–1200 °C. For zone-
growth boules, the thermal history of crystals depends on
their position in the boule, i.e., the initial part cools continu-
ously and slowly while the boule moves through the hot zone
at 6 mm/h, while the ﬁnal part will experience a different
history. This uncertainty can be mitigated by oxygen anneal-

ing and we found dramatic differences in the conversion of a
particular re-entrant crystal near hCO=0.5 into a “pure” CO
crystal. That conversion is shown in the magnetization data
of Fig. 3a, before annealing, and after each of three succes-
sive anneals. These postanneals are done in pure oxygen at
600 °C for 60 h followed by a slow-cooling protocol of
0.5 °C per minute that is expected to reduce  and not
change x note that slow cooling at 0.1 °C per minute for the
last of these anneals did not result in noticeably different
effects. After the ﬁrst anneal this crystal transforms into a
non-re-entrant crystal, indicating h has become very close to
0.5, and that the as-made crystal had h=x−0.5. Subse-
quent anneals showed very small, additional changes imply-
ing that one such anneal followed by our slow-cooling pro-
tocol is sufﬁcient to ﬁll a large fraction of oxygen vacancies
in as-grown crystals. From crystals made at neighboring
compositions x0=0.48 and 0.52 and others made at x0
=0.5, we can estimate the width of the CO phase to be no
larger than 0.01 and thus ﬁnd  to be 0.005 for the
as-made crystal, and that is within the limits of quenched
samples.20
Three crystals from the x0=0.61 boule 2, 3, and 5 also
underwent the same oxygen annealing and slow-cooling pro-
tocol. These data Fig. 3b indicate a barely discernable
change, implying very few vacancies in the x0=0.61 boule
unless vacancy ﬁlling for x=0.61 requires a radically differ-
ent protocol. Using the very small temperature shifts in
Fig. 3b and the transition temperature difference at the
ﬁxed points of h=0.60 and x=0.61, we estimate  to be
0.0003. This small value of  suggests that crystals 9–11
have hole doping, h=0.61−, very close to 0.61. The reason
for the much smaller effect in the as-made x0=0.61 boule is
not understood, but it could result from an x dependence of
oxygen vacancy formation or on differences in the actual
cool-down parameters following zone growth for the two
boules.
The existence of crystals with re-entrant CO for h in the
close vicinity of hCO=0.5 or 0.6 certiﬁes that the CO phase
ﬁelds are broader in h at intermediate temperature than at
low temperature. We present here a free-energy argument
that qualitatively explains this experimental fact. Consider
the free energy, U−TS, where U is the internal energy and S
is the entropy, for four states: high-temperature paramagnet,
competing
low-temperature
AAFM
state,
paramagnetic
charge and orbital ordered state CO PM, and ﬁnally the CO
AFM state, e.g., with in-plane AF CE magnetic structure that
is known8,9 to exist for h0.5 below about 130 K. For sim-
plicity of presentation, we neglect the temperature dependen-
cies of U and S, and make the plausible assumption that only
the U’s of the CO states are strongly dependent on h with a
symmetrical minimum at hCO. The PM state has the least
order and the highest entropy, so its U−TS will exhibit the
steepest negative slope versus temperature. The AAFM
phase with FM monolayers may be expected to have the
lowest entropy, and thus the ﬂattest slope. Of the CO states
the one with in-plane AF order has the lower entropy. The
result of these considerations is shown in the bottom of Fig.
4, for a particular choice of U for each state, and is drawn
assuming the CO states obey Uh−UhCOh−hCO. Then
the successive dashed CO curves from the bottom represent
increasing h-hCO. The solid squares circles indicate the
lower upper limit of stability for the CO states, while the
open circle indicates a direct transition from the AAFM to
PM. The phase diagram at the top of Fig. 4 is the projection
of these transition temperatures to their appropriate h values.
Note however that these AAFM to CO transitions squares
and CO to PM transitions circles are ﬁrst order so signiﬁ-
cant hysteresis is expected and found8,19 see Figs. 3 and 8.
FIG. 3. Color online The effect of annealing in pure oxygen at
600 °C for 60 h followed by our slow-cooling protocol is shown on
the magnetization both heating and cooling for a x0=0.5 and b
x0=0.61. The magnetization in a for the as-made crystal solid
lines is clearly re-entrant with hysteretic transitions from the PM to
CO phases near 200 K and between the CO and AAFM phases
centered at 125 K. Upon annealing this crystal transformed into a
non-re-entrant, predominantly CO phase down to the lowest tem-
peratures solid circles. Two further anneals solid squares and dia-
monds made much smaller changes, but in the same direction.
From this data the oxygen deﬁciency of the as-made crystal, , can
be estimated to be 0.005. For samples 2, 3, and 5 from the nomi-
nal 0.61 boule of Fig. 2, the magnetic behavior b after annealing
solid circles was barely distinguishable from the as-made crystals
solid lines and  is estimated see text to be an order of magni-
tude smaller at 0.0003.

Also, if AF order were frustrated in the CO state or occurred
at the PM to CO transition, say for 0.6 doping, then the
dashed lines in the lower part of Fig. 4 would be straight
lines with no kinks, as would be the phase lines in the upper
diagram from T=0 to the widest part of the CO phase.
As mentioned above, a high degree of crystal homogene-
ity is required to reveal the intrinsic behavior of bilayer man-
ganites, and the path to homogeneity starts with crystal
growth21 in a ﬂoating-zone, optical image furnace. From the
resulting boule, platelike crystals with the c axis normal are
extracted and shaped 20.50.1 mm3 so that four gold
pads can be deposited along the top and bottom surfaces for
six-terminal measurements22 of the c axis, 	c, and ab-plane,
	ab, conductivity. To evaluate homogeneity, we determine
and compare 	ab and 	c in four conﬁgurations see methods
A and B in the Appendix. For crystals very close to hCO
=0.6, the extraordinarily large anisotropy 105 at low tem-
peratures renders the six-terminal data not useful. However,
for such high anisotropy, combining two four-terminal mea-
surements, the top voltage of method A and V1 of method B,
provides sufﬁciently accurate values of 	ab and 	c. For each
four-terminal conﬁguration, the results for currents applied to
opposite sides of the crystal are compared to test homogene-
ity, and these data, presented in Fig. 5, are qualitatively iden-
tical and within a factor of 3, thus passing our criteria.8
It is of interest to compare the conductivity of pure CO
crystals at hCO=0.60 with re-entrant crystals with h0.59
and h0.61. Using the analysis described above,22 extraor-
dinarily low values of 	ab and 	c are reported here at low
temperatures in the pure CO state, whereas the AAFM
phases at h0.61 and19 h0.59 show especially high me-
tallic 	ab at low temperatures. This contrast of greater than
ten orders of magnitude is shown in Fig. 6. That it occurs for
a 1% change in Sr content is remarkable and this contrast
also reafﬁrms the uniformity of doping in our crystals. Note
however, we never found CO crystals for h0.5 without a
small 1−5% contamination of the AAFM phase Ref. 8
and Fig. 3a, but that is likely a result of the signiﬁcantly
narrower phase ﬁeld for hCO=0.50 and an inevitable small
doping inhomogeneity.

charge ordered phases in the bilayered manganites. The lower part
represents the free energy by accounting for the differences in en-
tropy, S, and internal energy, U, for the various phases, AAFM, CO

of T. The lowest dashed lines are for h=hCO e.g., hCO=0.5, while
the next ones show sequentially increasing h-hCO. The diagram
speciﬁcally calls out the appearance of AF order in the CO phase
e.g., the known CE AF order at 0.5 doping. The upper diagram
shows the transition points projected onto a phase diagram versus
doping, h-hCO in arbitrary units.

very close to 0.60. In this case the qualitatively identical data from
pairs of V1 and of Vt represent the two conﬁgurations of each four-

the worst case of V1, the magnitudes are within a factor of 3.

The phase diagram in Fig. 1 begs some open questions.
Can random doping yield such narrow needlelike phases?
Random
doping
would
require
rather
large
volumes
4000 unit cells 93 nm3 to achieve an average doping
within the very narrow doping ranges h 0.005 found
at the lowest temperatures for h0.5. Thus obtaining phase
purity with random doping addresses the Coulomb energy
needed to homogenize the charge and that is conveniently
discussed through a comparison of the electron screening
length, rs, with the needed 9-nm cell diameter from above.
For manganites, rs is not expected to be greater than values
typical of semiconductors, i.e., 2–3 nm, so that locally inho-
mogeneous phases would be expected for random doping
with h0.5. Given these estimates, it seems difﬁcult to
imagine that random doping could cause such an abrupt
change in phase uniformly over the entire crystal for a 1%
variation of average h, yet a high degree of uniformity has
been veriﬁed with four independent bulk probes.8 Cation or-
dering is one way to mitigate this issue. For h=0.5, on aver-
age, there is one La and two Sr per unit cell so there is a
symmetrical occupancy with La only in the 12-coordinated
site of the perovskite layer. The poor scattering contrast be-
tween La and Sr makes the determination of cation ordering
particularly hard but it has been reported23 for x0=0.4 and
0.5 samples. In each case there is a higher-than-average La
occupancy in the perovskite layer, but the 50% La enrich-
ment found for 0.5 may be too small to completely mitigate
the Coulomb energy.
The region of the phase diagram between these two
needlelike phases is not fully resolved. One issue is the elec-
tronic nature of AAFM states. For nominal x0=0.58 crys-
tals24 the extrapolated zero-temperature ab-plane conductiv-
ity is smaller than the data presented here for h0.59 and
0.61, but remains ﬁnite, i.e., metallic. For h0.46, much
lower values of 	 are seen25 at intermediate temperatures
with strongly insulating low-temperature behavior. For the
AAFM states of crystals near nominal h=0.5, the inter-
mediate-temperature conductivity values fall between these
two extremes,8 but insulating behavior is found at low tem-
peratures. A possible scenario is a continuous ab-plane-
metal-to-insulator transition as h decreases from 0.58 to
0.5. Note that the upper limit in h for the ab-plane metal is
presently unknown. In the above picture CO replaces the
AAFM over limited h ranges centered at 0.5 and 0.6 through
ﬁrst-order transitions, but the h dependence of the AAFM
states may be otherwise unaffected.
A second issue is the continuous variation of the superlat-
tice CO modulation over this doping range that was
inferred26 from the observed “incommensurate” superlattice
in the bilayer manganite at x0=0.55. A more complete set of
“incommensurate” doping was reported for the single-layer
manganites,27 La1−xSr1+xMnO4, together with a strong argu-
ment supporting a charge-density wave CDW picture.
Others28 report a discontinuous jump in the superlattice peak
for bilayer manganites between h=0.5 and 0.6. Our data
strongly imply that CO in bilayer manganites at h=0.5 and
0.6
only
exists
over
a
ﬁnite
doping
range
h
 0.01–0.02, as we ﬁnd many crystals, at x0=0.52, 0.54,
0.56, and24 0.58, that display a single transition in conduc-
tivity from a PM to an AAFM at low temperatures. Thus our
data exclude the existence of continuous CO states from 0.5
to 0.6, although we have insufﬁcient evidence to rule out,
e.g., an additional CO phase at h=0.55 as reported in Ref. 26
that would be necessarily needlelike. Each above issue
needs a systematic doping study to establish the behavior of
the La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7− phase diagram between the needle-
like CO phases at h=0.5 and 0.6.
Why is the CO at 0.6 more stable higher TCO and broader
h range than the highly symmetric checkerboard ordering7
of Mn+3 and Mn+4 charges at 0.5 doping? A suggested pic-
ture of local charge and orbital ordering for x=0.6 adds an
extra row of Mn+4 into the checkerboard pattern for every 5th
row to achieve 0.6 doping in a so-called quasibistripe
order.28 This leads to a far less symmetrical pattern that one
might expect to have a higher energy, and due to some frus-
trated AFM bonds, it also means that AFM will be less stable
than the CE magnetic structure at h=0.5. In spite of the
similar appearance of the needle-like phase ﬁelds, we now
address the possibility that the CO state at h0.6 is not due
to an arrangement of localized charges but more akin to a
charge-density wave.
To start out, we ﬁnd that the bilayer manganites behave
differently to single-layer27 and perovskite manganites in re-
gard to CO states between h=0.5 and 0.6. The superlattice
modulation wave vector, q, of the latter exhibit one of the
following: 1 a broad continuous variation29 of q starting
above 100 K; 2 a narrow temperature dependence30 of q
near TCO that could result from critical ﬂuctuations; or 3 a
broad transition starting at TAF and extending30 up to TCO.
All these have been discussed within a phenomenological
CDW picture.31 We ﬁnd for the re-entrant bilayer with h
0.59 that q is strictly temperature independent over its sta-
bility range 160–250 K, albeit its value of 0.21 is not
commensurate.19 The strong temperature dependencies of q
in the perovskites are probably not consistent with a Fermi-
surface nesting scenario for the CDW. However, at least
some of these data might be understood as a commensurate-
to-incommensurate transition32 preceding the disappearance
of CO at TCO. In the bilayer, the very narrow range of sta-
bility h=0.60.02 of the CO state would also seem to be
at odds with any Fermi-surface nesting feature that might be
expected to evolve more gradually with h. The question re-
mains as to when and if the locked-in, low-temperature su-
perlattice modulation is commensurate. In bilayer manga-
nites, a broad temperature-dependent variation of q was also
seen28 for x0=0.575 and 0.6 but for h=0.6 the low-
temperature q0.2 may be commensurate and is close to our
value19 of 0.21 for h0.59. That study28 also found that
x0=0.5
and
0.55
exhibited
temperature-independent
q
0.25, which is universally found and expected for check-
erboard ordering at h0.5. This discussion reveals that there
is much still to be learned about CO in the manganites.
In summary, our discovery of similar needlelike CO
phases centered at h=0.5 and 0.6 drastically modiﬁes the
accepted picture of the bilayer manganite phase diagram.
Compositional purity was crucial to our results and we en-
sured this by stringent testing of small 1 mg crystals.
Phases were veriﬁed by observations with up to four bulk
probes. The lack of sufﬁcient purity could explain why oth-
ers consistently report the lack of CO at low temperatures

APPENDIX
In general, the principal components of conductivity, i.e.,
along the c axis, 	c, and in the ab-plane, 	ab, cannot be
easily determined by four-terminal measurements so we
commonly use six of the eight terminals to determine each
individually. In transport method A, current is injected
through the outermost contacts on one surface Fig. 7a.
Laplace’s equation is solved and inverted to get 	ab and 	c
from voltages measured across the innermost contacts of
each surface. In method B, Laplace’s equation is solved for
current injection through the top and bottom contacts at one
end of the crystal, while voltages from the top to bottom of
the crystal are measured between any two of the three pairs
of remaining contacts Fig. 7b.
To test for homogeneity, we evaluate 	ab and 	c in four
conﬁgurations. Two use method A with current applied to the
outer contacts of either the top or bottom surfaces and two
use method B with current applied to the end contacts on
either the right- or left-hand sides. We require both 	abT
and 	cT to be qualitatively the same for all four conﬁgu-
rations and within a factor of 2–3 in magnitude. Crystal data
reported in this paper all pass our criteria.8,19 In Fig. 8 these
homogeneity tests are shown for two re-entrant crystals near
hCO=0.5 used in Ref. 8 while similar data are shown in Fig.
2 of Ref. 19 for h0.59.
For crystals very close to hCO=0.6, the extraordinarily
large anisotropy 105 at low temperatures render the six-
terminal data not useful. In method A the bottom voltage is
too small compared to noise and in method B the differences
of voltages V1 through V3 are too small. However, combining
two four-terminal measurements, the top voltage of method
A and V1 of method B, provides sufﬁciently accurate values
of 	ab and 	c when the anisotropy is so large. In this case,
our homogeneity test compares the results for each four-
terminal conﬁguration when currents are applied to opposite
sides of the crystal. These data, presented above in Fig. 5,
pass our criteria.

for a method A and b method B.
FIG. 8. Color online Homogeneity tests for 	ab on two re-
entrant crystals Ref. 8 with x0=0.5. The four sets of data for each
crystal are comprised of two by method A on both sides of crystal
and two by method B at both ends of crystal. The hysteresis for
each transition shows clearly they are of ﬁrst order. The occasional
sharp features are artifacts of slight inhomogeneity of the transition
points along the length of the crystal and the abrupt change of 	ab
at the ﬁrst-order transitions note that the accompanying positive
and negative peaks at around 70 K in the top curves dictate these
features are not intrinsic. All data sets for each crystal are qualita-
tively very similar and within a factor of three in magnitude.
