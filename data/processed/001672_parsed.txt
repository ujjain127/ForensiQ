M
edical errors are one of the leading causes of
death and injury in the United States, respon-
sible for more deaths each year than AIDS,
breast cancer, or motor vehicle accidents.1 Medication
errors are the most common type of medical error.2 A
medication error is “any preventable event that may cause
or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm
while the medication is in the control of the health care
professional, patient, or consumer.”3 Considerable evi-
dence demonstrates that medication errors are frequent,
costly, and occur in all health care settings.4–6
The analysis reported in this article focuses on one type
of adverse event involving medications in acute care inpa-
tient settings—errors associated with code situations. A
code situation is defined as “an emergency situation in
which a specialized team of health care professionals [is]
summoned to the scene by an agreed upon signal (e.g.,
code blue), to deliver immediate life support measures to
the patient.”7(p. 113) This definition differs from the stricter
definition of cardiac and/or respiratory arrest propounded
by the American Heart Association in that it is more
inclusive of severely harmful events such as profound
hypotension, arrhythmias, and severe respiratory depres-
sion that may progress to an arrest.8
Code situations interrupt the normal work flow of a
hospital, requiring staff from various areas of the hospital
to leave their work areas to attend to a critically ill patient.
Given the emergent nature of the situation, little time is
available to providers for thought, discussion, and estab-
lishment of effective cross-coverage of duties. Many differ-
ent types of error can occur during code situations, and
these errors can affect a variety of patients. Such errors
include not only errors to the patient coding but also
errors to other patients whose health care providers are
attending the code.
Literature on code-related errors is scarce, and informa-
tion on code-related errors affecting patients other than
the one involved in the code is largely unavailable.
Improving the safety and efficacy of code situations
requires a better understanding of the type and character-
istics of errors that occur during these unique times. The
specific aim of this study was to describe code-related
errors using a national medication error report database
(MEDMARX®) that captures information on these and
other types of medication errors. 
Methods
DATA SOURCE
MEDMARX is a national, voluntary, anonymous medica-
tion error reporting system maintained by the United
States Pharmacopeia. Currently collecting more than
14,000 error reports per month from caregivers and staff
of member facilities, the database now holds more than
1.2 million adverse drug event records from more than
880 subscribing hospitals, health systems, and other
health care facilities. Subscribing facilities, representing
every state in the United States, include academic centers,
community facilities, government-affiliated hospitals, and

specialty hospitals of varying bed size. Nearly two-thirds of
these facilities have fewer than 200 beds, 80% are general
community hospitals, 7% are teaching institutions, and
30% are government operated, making MEDMARX
comparable to the United States hospital population as
characterized by the American Hospital Association.9,10
We included error reports submitted to MEDMARX
between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005, with
“code situation,” as defined, selected from a structured list
of contributing factors. Given the difference in code situ-
ations in-hospital as compared to out-of-hospital, only in-
hospital errors were included. Non-code-related in-
hospital errors were used for comparison. 
ANALYSIS
We performed both qualitative and quantitative 
analyses.
Qualitative Analysis. Our qualitative analysis of the
reports used free-text descriptions of the error to create a
new variable describing how the error was related to a code
situation (the “relationship to code situation variable”).
Values include error to the patient involved in the code,
error to a patient other than the one coding (a “collateral
damage error”), error that precipitated a code situation,
and error that occurred after a code situation. We expect-
ed the majority of the error reports to describe errors to the
patient involved in the code. Error reports were assigned
values for the new variable only if the free-text description
contained information confirming that the contributing
factor “code situation” was chosen on the basis of the pro-
vided MEDMARX definition. Confirmation was based
on the presence of one or more of the following key words
in the free-text description: code, emergency, mask venti-
lation, intubation, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS),
seizure, status epilepticus, cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR), defibrillation, arrhythmia, cardioversion, cardiac
arrest, respiratory arrest, resuscitation, rescue efforts,
STAT, trauma, ventilator, life-threatening, hypotension,
critical situation, and airway established. 
Two researchers [A.K.M.L., B.D.W.] independently
reviewed the free-text descriptions and generated a value
of the new variable for each report. Reports without any of
these key words but describing grave clinical situations
were assigned a value based on reviewer consensus. Error
reports that did not meet these criteria were excluded from
the analysis. The excluded reports described general med-
ication errors and/or errors in which “code situation” was
selected as a contributing factor on the basis of a definition
of code that differs from the MEDMARX definition (for
example, code defined as “a word, letter, number, or other
symbol used in a code system to mark, represent, or iden-
tify something”11).
Quantitative Analysis. We performed quantitative
analysis on all reports that met inclusion criteria, as well as
subgroup analysis by the variable describing relationship
to the code situation. Comparisons were made among
code-related errors as well as between code-related and
non-code-related in-hospital errors reported during the
same period. We hypothesized (1) that code-related errors
would be more harmful and more likely to result in cor-
rective action than non-code-related errors, and (2) that
collateral damage errors would be more likely to report
distractions and work load increases as contributing fac-
tors than noncollateral damage errors. Statistical signifi-
cance was assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test (for cells with n < 10). Univariate odds ratios
(ORs) were calculated. 
We performed multiple logistic regression with general-
ized estimating equation and robust estimation of variance
to examine the relationship between collateral damage
errors and resulting corrective action, with adjustment for
characteristics of the error and harm resulting from the
error. Our primary outcome measure was whether the
error resulted in any corrective action; we hypothesized
that collateral damage errors would be less likely to result
in corrective actions than other code-related errors. The
type of action taken was a secondary outcome measure.
We classified actions as policy-level or non-policy-level.
Policy-level actions included acquisition or modification
of computer software, environmental modification,
change in formulary, initiation or alteration of a policy or
procedure, and modification of staffing practice or policy.
We assumed that errors with no reported corrective action
resulted in no action. Our primary predictor variable was
whether or not the code-related error was a collateral dam-
age error; resulting harm was a secondary predictor vari-
able. We adjusted for location of the error, node at which
the error occurred, whether or not the error occurred on a
weekend, contributing factors associated with the error,
and cause of the error.

We checked for interaction between harm and all other
covariates; no statistically significant interaction was
found. The likelihood ratio test was used to exclude
unnecessary covariates. Collinearity for logistic regression
analyses was checked by performing multiple linear regres-
sion instead of the logistic regression analyses to calculate
the variance inflation factors, which were all less than 2.0.
We used the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to assess goodness of
fit of the final model. Generalized linear models were used
in the event of poor model fit. 
We explored alternative models to test some of our
assumptions. First, we imputed 452 missing values for the
outcome of resulting corrective action and repeated the
analysis. Imputation of the missing values did not change
the results of the analysis. In addition, we repeated the
analysis excluding a cluster of 100 collateral damage error
reports from one facility that were identical in nature and
therefore had questionable integrity. Exclusion of these
reports did not affect our conclusions. Statistical analyses
were performed using Stata statistical software release 9.0
(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). 
Results
CHARACTERISTICS OF CODE-RELATED ERRORS
From 2000 to 2005, a total of 1,043,939 errors were
reported to the MEDMARX database from 834 health
care facilities. Code situation was selected as a contribut-
ing factor in 2,288 (0.22%) errors from 384 facilities,
2,034 errors of which occurred in a hospital setting. In
contrast, there were 897,194 non-code-related in-hospital
errors. Among the 2,034 code-related errors,
■29 were prescription coding errors (those who reported
the error chose code situation on the basis of a definition
of the term different from the one provided by MED-
MARX).
■1,163 were general medication errors with none of our
key words in the free-text description; it was not possible
to determine why code situation was chosen as a con-
tributing factor in these cases nor to determine a value for
the relationship to code variable. These 1,163 errors were
excluded from the analysis. 
Therefore, 842 error reports were available for this
analysis. 
Of these 842 errors, 94% occurred in general commu-
nity hospitals. Errors most commonly occurred in a gener-
al patient care ward (70%), emergency department (ED;
8.2%), or intensive care unit (ICU; 7.5%). Eighty-six per-
cent of these errors occurred during medication adminis-
tration. The most common type of error was an omission
error (72%); 9.0% were improper dose errors and 5.7%
were unauthorized drug administration errors. Errors most
frequently involved registered nurses (45%) and respirato-
ry therapists (43%), and were also most frequently discov-
ered by these two groups. The errors involved 137 unique
drugs and 52 unique therapeutic classes. Anti-
asthma/bronchodilators (69%), autonomic medications
(5.2%), and sedative/hypnotics (4.5%) were the most
common therapeutic classes implicated in the errors. Each
report listed, on average, 1.5 causes of the error: 30% of
errors were associated with performance (human) deficit,
16% with work flow disruption, and 12% with lack of
adherence to a procedure or protocol. Although all reports
listed “code situation” as a contributing factor, 37% select-
ed at least one other contributing factor, and 7% had a
total of four or more contributing factors. The most com-
mon additional contributing factors were emergency situ-
ation, work load increase, and insufficient staffing. Fifty
five (6.5%) of the errors were associated with patient
harm, and there were five deaths (0.59%), making code-
related errors 39 times more likely to result in harm than
non-code-related in-hospital errors (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 28.9–51.4) and 51.5 times more likely to
result in death (95% CI: 16.4–124.6). 
Only 390 of the 842 reports answered the MEDMARX
question regarding actions taken in response to the error.
We assumed that lack of response to this question implied
no action resulted from the error. Overall, 29% of errors
resulted in some action. The most common reported
actions were “informed staff who made the initial error”
(17% of all errors) and provision of additional education
or training (6.4% of all errors). Only 4.4% of errors result-
ed in report of a policy-level action. Harmful errors were
3.8 times more likely than non-harmful errors to result in
action (95% CI: 2.17–6.64), and 3.7 times more likely to
result in a policy-level action (95% CI: 1.54–8.80).
CHARACTERISTICS OF ERRORS BY RELATIONSHIP
TO THE CODE SITUATION
Not all the code-related error reports described errors
occurring during a code situation and affecting the patient

involved in the code. In fact, the error reports described
four distinct ways in which the error could be associated
with a code situation. Table 1 (above) provides excerpts
from free-text error descriptions for error reports in each
of these categories. Table 2 (page 50) summarizes the 842
error reports by their relationship to the code situation.
Nearly three-quarters (74%) of the reported errors
involved patients other than the patient involved in the
code, that is, collateral damage errors. Twenty-one percent
involved patients directly experiencing codes, 3% involved
errors preceding—and possibly precipitating—codes, and
2% affected patients following a code. 
Table 3 (page 51) and Table 4 (page 52) show the char-
acteristics of the error reports by their relationship to the
code situation. Errors affecting the patient involved in the
code were statistically significantly more likely to be harm-
ful than other code-related errors (OR for harm 6.7; 95%
CI: 3.66–12.41), whereas collateral damage errors were
less likely to be harmful (OR, 0.005; 95% CI:
0.0001–0.30). Not surprisingly, errors preceding codes
were the most likely to result in harm. Two of the report-
ed five deaths were associated with errors occurring during

Patient called for pain med. Patient’s nurse was in a code in another room. Nurse at
than the one coding 
desk checked medication administration record (MAR) and administered 10 mg 
(collateral damage)
morphine IV. After code ended, nurses spoke and the patient's nurse had 
administered a dose prior to code but was unable to document it on the MAR due to the
code situation.
Lopressor, Vasotec, and Solucortef IV given to wrong patient. Nurse states another
patient had just coded, was being transferred to CCU.
Proventil dose was omitted on a 74-year-old female due to respiratory therapist busy at
a code.
Error preceding a code
Demerol and Phenergan were ordered by the physician and given by the nurse. Both
were listed in MAR with adverse reaction by patient. Patient felt “faint” with Phenergan
given, she was laid flat and monitored. Within 5 minutes, respirations ceased—patient
was bagged to 100% O2 on bivalve mask. Several minutes later, the patient had no
pulse and CPR was started. CPR was successful. Patient put on ventilator. 
After open heart surgery, the patient's blood pressure fell precipitously. Patient returned
to operating room for exploratory surgery. The cause of the blood pressure drop was
found to be the inadvertent restart of nitroglycerin, which was still hanging at the bedside
but was not ordered.
Error occurring after a code
After surviving a code situation, the patient had systolic blood pressure in the 50s; a
dopamine drip was started without improvement. Report from pulmonary step-down unit
said the drip was infusing at 10 mcg/hr. It was actually infusing at 10 mcg/kg/hr or 0.4
cc/hr. 
Crash cart opened in ICU but not replaced until 5 days later. Policy is daily checks on
the unit.

the code and affecting the patient involved in the code,
and three were associated with errors preceding the code.
No deaths were reported as a result of collateral damage
errors. Errors among the four subgroups did not differ sig-
nificantly by time of day or day of week. 
Collateral Damage Errors. Collateral damage errors
were statistically significantly more likely to report work
flow disruption as a cause of the error than other code-
related errors; more than  20% of collateral damage errors
reported this type of disruption as a probable cause. In
addition, insufficient staffing and work load increase were
statistically significantly more likely to be reported as con-
tributing factors for collateral damage errors than other
code-related errors, reported in 17% and 15% of collater-
al damage reports, respectively. Collateral damage errors,
overwhelmingly errors of omission (92%), were most
commonly associated with the administration node. The
errors occurred overwhelmingly on adult patient care units
(86%). 
As expected, the medications implicated in the error
varied by subgroup as well. Nearly 90% of collateral dam-
age errors involved anti-asthmatic drugs and bronchodila-
tors, reflecting a high proportion of missed respiratory
therapy treatments in this group. However, 52 unique
drug classes were implicated in collateral damage errors;
other drug classes commonly involved included central
nervous system medications (13.1%) and autonomic med-
ication (7.1%). (Percentage totals may exceed 100%
because multiple therapeutic classes can be included in
each report.) 
Errors Affecting the Coded Patient. In comparison,
errors occurring during the code and affecting the patient
coding were more likely to be due to an improper dose or
quantity of a drug, and contributing factors included
emergency situation and distractions. Common causes
included performance deficit and communication. These
errors often occurred in the ED/admitting or adult ICU as
well as the adult patient care unit and were more frequent-
ly due to problems at the dispensing (26%) and prescrib-
ing (11%) nodes. Autonomic medications and sedative
hypnotics accounted for almost 40% of errors occurring
during the code and affecting the patient coding. Errors
preceding code situations involved a variety of therapeutic
classes, including opioids (15%), antianginals (12%), and
beta-lactams (8%).
TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION AFTER ERRORS
OCCUR
Table 5 (page 53) shows the percent of errors resulting
in action by the relationship of the error to the code situ-
ation. As compared to other code-related errors and non-
code-related in-hospital errors, collateral damage errors
were statistically significantly less likely to result in any
action taken. Only 18% of these errors resulted in an
action; the most common action reported was “informed
staff who made the initial error.”  In comparison, nearly
60% of other code-related errors resulted in action, and
40% of non-code-related in-hospital errors resulted in
action. Furthermore, only 2.9% of collateral damage
errors resulted in a policy-level action—statistically signif-
icantly less than other code-related errors (8.6%; p =
.0004) but more than non-code-related errors (only 1.7%
resulted in policy-level action, p = .025). Changes in
staffing practice or policy accounted for more than 80% of
policy-level actions reported after collateral damage errors.
Given evidence that action is more likely after harmful
errors, we performed multiple logistic regression to assess
the relationship between collateral damage errors and cor-
rective action, controlling for harm and other potential
confounders (Table 6, page 54). Collateral damage errors
were 88% less likely than other code-related errors to
result in corrective action of any kind (95% CI:
80%–92% less likely). Further, errors in which the
reporter identified contributing factors in addition to code
situation were statistically significantly more likely to
result in action; of these, errors associated with distractions
were the most likely to result in action (p < .001). Whether
the error resulted in harm was not statistically significant
in the multiple logistic regression model. The node of the

error and whether or not the error occurred on a weekend
were not included in the final model on the basis of likeli-
hood ratio testing. To evaluate policy-level corrective
actions, we used underdispersed logistic regression to
adjust for poor fit. Policy-level corrective actions were
73% less likely after collateral damage errors as compared
with all other code-related errors, after adjusting for all
covariates (95% CI: 54%–84% less likely).
Discussion
Several studies have assessed medication errors during
resuscitations, and many other studies have looked at the
larger issue of performance during code situations and
code quality.12–17 None of these studies, however, have
effectively described the impact or nature of medication
errors that occur during codes, nor have they attempted to
assess the collateral damage associated with code situa-
tions. Our study describes the landscape of medication
errors associated with code situations in hospitals in the
United States and identifies potential opportunities to
improve medication safety, on the basis of reports from a
national, anonymous, voluntary error reporting system.
As reported, nearly three-quarters of code-related errors
were collateral damage errors, in which the patient affect-
ed by the medication error was someone other than the
patient involved in the code. Most of these errors were
administration errors secondary to omission of a respirato-
ry therapy treatment, but extra doses, improper quantities,
prescribing errors, and wrong route/patient/time errors
were also reported. Not surprisingly, collateral damage

errors were often attributed to work load increases, insuf-
ficient staffing, work flow disruption, and performance
deficit. Fortunately, these errors were likely to result in
near misses rather than patient harm. 
Even after controlling for harm level, however, collater-
al damage errors were far less likely to result in any action
to reduce the risk of recurrence and, when actions were
taken, they were often not policy-level actions. This lack of
corrective action is troubling given that all errors harbor
the potential for harm and even death. Often, little is
known about harmless errors and near misses, making it
difficult to make system-level changes to prevent a similar
error from leading to a sentinel event; with this large num-
ber of collateral damage errors, we have uncovered system-
level problems in ready need of corrective action.

STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING ERRORS: PREVENTION
OF CODE SITUATIONS
The ideal solution to the problem of code-related med-
ication errors is prevention of code situations. Although
complete elimination is not a realistic goal, reducing the
frequency of code situations is potentially feasible.
Implementation of rapid response systems (RRS) is one
strategy that may decrease the frequency of codes. In one
study, introduction of an RRS was associated with a 50%
reduction in the incidence of unexpected cardiac arrest.18
Although a recent systematic review of RRSs found only
weak to moderate evidence that such systems are associat-
ed with a decrease in cardiac arrest rates,19 these systems do
show promise in reducing the number of code situations.
However, RRSs still require planning for the adequate cov-
erage of all patients when caregivers on the rapid response
team respond to a deteriorating patient.
Another strategy involves do-not-resuscitate (DNR)
orders. The frequency of errors due to code situations
highlights the importance of having early conversations
with patients regarding code status and DNR orders.
Knowledge of a patient’s preference not to be resuscitated
can save the patient from the trauma of being coded, save
the family from the anguish that such a situation can bring
about, and prevent collateral damage errors from affecting
other patients. Still, only 52% of patients who do not wish
to be resuscitated have DNR orders on their charts.20
STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING COLLATERAL DAMAGE
ERRORS
Although reduction in the frequency of code situations
may decrease the incidence of all code-related errors, other
system-level solutions must also be considered to reduce
the risk of future harm (Table 7, page 55). Given the fre-
quency with which work load increases, insufficient
staffing, and workflow disruption were associated with
collateral damage errors (Sidebar 1, page 55), staffing level
and structure and cross-coverage protocols and strategies
should be scrutinized. Increased nurse staffing levels have
been shown to reduce adverse patient outcomes, decrease
rates of cardiac arrest, and shorten lengths of stay in both
medical and surgical patients.21
Undoubtedly, increased
nurse staffing levels would decrease the incidence of collat-
eral damage errors associated with code situations.
However, such a solution has significant financial costs.
Other, less expensive solutions could include staffing
redesign, such that every patient has a backup care
provider in the event his or her primary care provider is
away at a code, and cross-coverage protocols for code situ-
ations. 
Because omissions of respiratory therapy as a result of
another patient’s code situation were found at such high
frequency, consideration of these treatments is warranted.
First, we should ask whether they are necessary in all cases.
Although evidence substantiates the usefulness of nebuliz-
er treatments in asthma,22 chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease,23 and mechanically ventilated patients,24 wide-
spread use in hospitalized patients is not supported in the
literature. Indeed, respiratory therapy is only one example
of drugs that are commonly used, perhaps without a valid
clinical indication. Research into the proportion of
patients receiving drug therapy without a valid indication

must be undertaken, and the unnecessary use of such treat-
ment should be stopped. Second, the human resources
associated with the administration of these medications
should be addressed. The free-text descriptions of collater-
al damage errors in our study implied that in many institu-
tions, nurses are not permitted to administer respiratory
treatments even when a respiratory therapist is busy in a
code situation. Although division of labor is obviously ben-
eficial, rigid policies and procedures regarding delineation
of responsibilities regarding respiratory therapy, as well as
other duties, may need to be modified to ensure appropri-
ate provision of care when human resources are limited. 
STUDY LIMITATIONS
First, although the sample was drawn from one of the
largest medication error reporting systems in the United
States, the sample size in our study is relatively small and
may not accurately reflect the universe of code-related
errors. It is also possible that the proportion of collateral
damage errors in our study overestimates the actual pro-
portion of collateral damage errors among all code-related
errors. This may be true for several reasons. Errors involv-
ing the coding patient may be underreported. Because the
expected success rate of resuscitation is low, “an unsuccess-
ful outcome does not invoke looking for errors in treat-
ment.”13(p. 404) In addition, patients involved in a failed
resuscitation do not show signs of unexpected deteriora-
tion as other patients do, making errors harder to identify.
Further, collateral damage errors may have been overre-
ported in our database by nurses and respiratory therapists
eager for change in policies and/or practices. More than
100 of the collateral damage errors came from one facility;
however, the reports were submitted during a period of
three and a half years, and results of the primary analysis
did not differ significantly when these reports were exclud-
ed (analysis not shown), suggesting this cluster did not sig-
nificantly affect our conclusions. 
A second consideration is that MEDMARX error
reports may underestimate the level of resulting harm
because of omitted or unknown data. Providers who com-
plete the error reports may not know or evaluate the full
impact of the collateral damage error, especially if that
impact is delayed. Providers may also be hesitant to report
the actual severity of a harmful error because of fear of
reprisal or lack of a culture of safety. Indeed, in our analy-
sis, we observed that reporters of code-related errors tend-
ed to underestimate the level of severity of the error; for
example, errors preceding code situations often were not
reported as errors “that required intervention necessary to
sustain life”—the definition of a code situation. In addi-
tion, many omission errors were reported as errors that
“did not reach the patient.” Of course, omission errors by
definition involve medication failing to reach the patient;
but it does not necessarily follow that the error (and its
deleterious effects) does not reach the patient. 
This study is also limited by our assumption that errors

with no reported corrective action resulted in no action. In
fact, some of the errors with no reported corrective action
might have resulted in corrective action that was either not
reported or took place after the error report was filed.
Finally, other limitations of this study relate to the use of
data from an anonymous reporting system. These include
inability to assess the validity of the data as well as the
inability to identify over- and underreporting. Although
we excluded code situation errors that clearly used a differ-
ent definition of code situation than the one employed by
MEDMARX, it is possible that not all code-related errors
included in this analysis were truly related to code situa-
tions in accordance with the MEDMARX definition. It is
also possible that some errors related to MEDMARX-
defined code situations were mistakenly omitted because
of our relatively conservative inclusion criteria. 
Conclusion
Medication errors associated with code situations not only
affect only the patient involved in the code but have impli-
cations for other patients as well. Code-related errors
involving the coding patient carry significant risk for
harm, whereas collateral damage errors seem to have a
1. Reduce the frequency of code situations.
■Implement Rapid Response Systems (RRS).
■ Review institutional policies and procedures regard-
ing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders.
■ Ensure adequate patient-to-staff ratios.
2. Reduce collateral damage medication errors.
■ Consider “redundant staffing” so that all patients
have “backup” providers in the event their primary
providers are responding to a code. (This may include
creating “groups” of patient responsibility so that more
than one person is familiar with each patient.) 
■ Develop cross-coverage protocols to care for
patients whose providers are responding to a code.
■ Avoid cross-coverage of patients by providers who
do not know them.
■ Examine institutional policies and procedures
regarding indications for the necessity of respiratory
therapy.
■ Consider whether trained nurses can deliver respi-
ratory drugs when respiratory therapists are respond-
ing to a code or other emergency.
■ Develop protocols and systems that require a  
double-check for all medication administration for all
patients when a cardiopulmonary arrest or RRS event
occurs on the ward.
3. Review postcode procedures.
■ Establish clear roles and responsibilities for post-
code procedures, including restocking the “crash
cart.”
Table 7. Strategies for Reducing Code-Related
Medication Errors
A complex patient with a medical history that included
hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was
recuperating on an intermediate-care medical ward after
a COPD exacerbation associated with a pulmonary 
infection. The patient’s medications included a course of 
levofloxacin for the infection, intravenous (IV) metoprolol
and enalapril for the hypertension and CAD, and IV
hydrocortisone taper for the COPD exacerbation.
One evening, the patient’s registered nurse (R.N.)
became involved in the cardiac arrest of another patient
on the ward. The resuscitation was long but successful,
and the nurse became very busy arranging for the trans-
fer of the postcode patient to the intensive care unit. The
R.N. asked a licensed practical nurse (L.P.N.) to adminis-
ter the COPD patient’s IV medications, which were due
during the time he was occupied with the coding patient.
The L.P.N., who had not previously cared for the COPD
patient, accessed the medication administration record
but mistakenly administered the metoprolol, hydrocorti-
sone, and enalapril to a third, unrelated patient, who did
not have a history of hypertension or COPD.
After the code patient’s transfer was completed, the R.N.
noted that the medications had been administered to the
wrong patient. Physical examination and vital signs
demonstrated that, despite the error, the patient who mis-
takenly received the three medications was able to main-
tain his blood pressure and heart rate within acceptable
limits, although these vital signs were depressed from
baseline. This patient required an increased level of
monitoring. The patient with the COPD exacerbation
received the appropriate medication several hours late. 
The MEDMARX report of this incident identified the 
following factors as contributing to the error: 
■ Communication
■ Performance (human) deficit
■ Procedure/protocol not followed
■ Work flow disruption
■ Code situation
■ Distractions

lower risk. However, because collateral damage errors are
often secondary to system problems such as understaffing
and limited cross-coverage, they are likely harbingers of
future harmful errors. Unfortunately, collateral damage
errors are unlikely to result in corrective action. The sys-
tem problems exposed by collateral damage errors deserve
attention. Further research into the causes and conse-
quences of these errors is in order. Action must be taken at
the policy level to mitigate the weaknesses in the system
that allow these errors to occur.
