SAI Section 1 - Procedures Attribute 
Objective:   Procedures, instructions, and information are 
documented methods for accomplishing a process. The certificate holder's policies should establish their 
compliance posture. Policies may be stand-alone statements, or they may be imbedded within 
procedures, instructions, or information regarding a particular regulatory requirement. The questions in 
this section of the data collection tool (DCT) are designed to assist the inspector in determining if the 
certificate holder has documented or prescribed methods of accomplishing the process requirements that 
provide answers to the associated questions regarding who, what, when, where, and how. This section 
contains policy questions, procedural 
questions, and instructional or informational questions pertaining to various types of certificate holder 
requirements such as actions, prohibitions, or resources (i.e., personnel, facilities, equipment, technical 
data, etc.). 
Tasks 
 
To meet this objective, the inspector must accomplish the following tasks: 
1. 
Review the information listed in the Supplemental Information section of this DCT. 
2. 
Review the duties and responsibilities for management and other personnel identified by the 
certificate holder who accomplish the Training of Check Airmen and Instructors process. 
3. 
Review the certificate holder’s Training of Check Airmen and Instructors process to ensure it 
contains the policies, procedures, instructions and information necessary for personnel to perform 
their duties and responsibilities with a high degree of safety. 
 
Questions 
 
 
To meet this objective, the inspector must answer the following questions: 
 
 
 1. 
Does the certificate holder's Training of Check Airmen and Instructors process 
meet the specific regulatory and FAA policy requirements:

if applicable, the particular variations within that airplane type, appropriate 
training material, examinations, forms, instructions, and procedures for use in 
conducting the training and checks required by 14 CFR part 121?

SAI Section 2 - Controls Attribute 
Objective:   Controls are checks and restraints designed into a process to ensure a desired result. The 
questions in this section of the DCT are designed to assist the inspector in determining if checks and 
restraints are designed into the process to ensure the desired result is achieved. Controls should be 
written into the system to ensure that the most important policies, procedures, or instructions and 
information will be followed. 
 
  
 
 
  
Controls may be in the form of administrative controls, which are secondary or supplemental written 
procedures. Like written procedures, administrative controls also need to provide answers to questions 
regarding who, what, when, where, and how. Controls may also be in the form of engineered controls, 
such as automated features or mechanical actions or devices (i.e., safety devices, warning devices, etc.). 
Tasks 
 
To meet this objective, the inspector must accomplish the following tasks: 
1. 
Review the control questions below. 
2. 
Review the certificate holder's policies, procedures, instructions, and information to gain an 
understanding of the controls that it has documented. 
 
Questions 
 
To meet this objective, the inspector must answer the following questions: 
 
 1. 
Are the following controls built into the Training of Check Airmen and Instructors 
process:

that may develop during training and checking in an airplane in flight?        
 Yes 
 No, Explain 
1.4. 
Is there a control or controls in place to ensure that instructors and check airmen

motion failures that may occur during training and checking sessions?        
 Yes 
 No, Explain 
 Not Applicable 
1.5. 
Is there a control or controls in place to ensure that instructors and check airmen

applicable?        
 Yes 
 No, Explain

are proficient in performing seat-dependent tasks while conducting airplane 
training and checks from the left and right pilot seats?        
 Yes 
 No, Explain

of any changes made to the controls in the Training of Check Airmen and 
Instructors process?

SAI Section 3 - Process Measurement Attribute 
Objective:   Process measurements are used by the certificate holder to measure and assess its 
processes, to identify and correct problems or potential problems, and to make improvements to the 
processes. The questions in this section of the DCT are designed to assist the inspector in determining if 
the certificate holder measures or assesses information to identify, analyze, and document potential 
problems with the process. Process measurements are a certificate holder's internal evaluation or 
auditing of the most important policies, procedures, or instructions and information associated with an 
element. 
 
  
 
 
  
To prevent the duplication of work, process measurements are most commonly addressed through a 
combination of auditing features contained in both the certificate holder's safety program/internal 
evaluation program (for operations and cabin safety-related issues) and the auditing function of the 
Continuous Analysis and Surveillance System (for airworthiness or maintenance/inspection-related 
issues). The director of safety and the quality assurance department often work together to accomplish 
this function for the certificate holder. This approach requires amendment of the safety program/internal 
evaluation program audit forms or checklists and the Continuous Analysis and Surveillance System audit 
forms or checklists to include the specific process measurements for each element. 
Tasks 
 
To meet this objective, the inspector must accomplish the following tasks: 
1. 
Review the process measurement questions below. 
2. 
Review the certificate holder's policies, procedures, instructions, and information to gain an 
understanding of the process measurements that it has documented.

To meet this objective, the inspector must answer the following questions: 
 
1. 
Does the certificate holder's Training of Check Airmen and Instructors process 
include the following process measurements: 
 
1.1. 
Is there a process measurement or process measurements that would identify if 
there were not enough flight instructors available to conduct training?

SAI Section 4 - Interfaces Attribute 
Objective:   Interfaces are used by the certificate holder to identify and manage the interactions between 
processes. The questions in this section of the DCT are designed to assist the inspector in determining 
whether or not interactions between the policies, procedures, or instructions and information associated 
with other independent processes within the certificate holder's organization are documented. Written 
policies, procedures, or instructions and information that are interrelated and located in different areas 
within the certificate holder's system must be consistent and complement each other. For the interfaces to 
be effectively managed, the certificate holder's system should identify and document the 
interfaces.

To meet this objective, the inspector must accomplish the following tasks: 
1. 
Review the interfaces associated with the Training of Check Airmen and Instructors process that 
have been identified along with the individual questions in section 1, Procedures, of this DCT. 
2. 
Review the certificate holder's policies, procedures, instructions, and information to gain an 
understanding of the interfaces that it has documented.
