H-120.988 Patient Access to Treatments Prescribed by Their 
Physicians 
 
  
The AMA confirms its strong support for the autonomous clinical decision-making authority of a 
physician and that a physician may lawfully use an FDA approved drug product or medical device 
for an unlabeled indication when such use is based upon sound scientific evidence and sound 
medical opinion; and affirms the position that, when the prescription of a drug or use of a device 
represents safe and effective therapy, third party payers, including Medicare, should consider the 
intervention as reasonable and necessary medical care, irrespective of labeling, should fulfill their 
obligation to their beneficiaries by covering such therapy, and be required to cover appropriate 
"off-label" uses of drugs on their formulary. The AMA recommends the following:  
Prescribing and Reimbursement for FDA-Approved Drugs and Devices for Unlabeled Uses  
(1) Our AMA reaffirms the following policies: (a) A physician may lawfully use an FDA-approved 
drug product or medical device for an unlabeled indication when such use is based upon sound 
scientific evidence and sound medical opinion (Policy H-120.988); (b) When the prescription of a 
drug or use of a device represents safe and effective therapy, third party payers, including 
Medicare, should consider the intervention as reasonable and necessary medical care, 
irrespective of labeling, and should fulfill their obligation to their beneficiaries by covering such 
therapy (Policy H-120.988); and (c) Our AMA encourages the use of three compendia (AMA's 
Drug Evaluations*; United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information, Volume I*; and American 
Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information) and the peer-reviewed literature for determining the 
medical acceptability of unlabeled uses (Policy H-165.896, #15). (*These two compendia 
currently are being merged as the result of an alliance between the American Medical Association 
and the United States Pharmacopeia.)  
Dissemination of Information about Unlabeled Uses of Drugs and Devices by Manufacturers  
(2) Our AMA strongly supports the important need for physicians to have access to accurate and 
unbiased information about unlabeled uses of drugs and devices, while ensuring that 
manufacturer-sponsored promotions remain under FDA regulation. (3) Our AMA supports the 
dissemination of independently derived scientific information about unlabeled uses by 
manufacturers to physicians, if the independent information is provided in its entirety, is not edited 
or altered by the manufacturer, and is clearly distinguished from manufacturer-sponsored 
materials. Dissemination of information by manufacturers to physicians about unlabeled uses can 
be supported under the following conditions: (a) Reprints of independently derived articles from 
reputable, peer-reviewed journals that meet the following criteria: (i) The article should be peer 
reviewed and published in accordance with the regular peer review procedure of the journal in 
which it is published; (ii) The reprint should be from a peer-reviewed journal that both has an 
editorial board and utilizes experts to review and objectively select, reject, or provide comments 
about proposed articles; such experts should have demonstrated expertise in the subject of the 
article under review, and be independent from the journal; (iii) The journal is recognized to be of 
national scope and reputation, as defined by an advisory panel to the FDA; among its members, 
this advisory panel should have representatives from national medical societies; (iv) The journal 
must be indexed in the Index Medicus of the National Library of Medicine; (v) The journal must 
have and adhere to a publicly stated policy of full disclosure of any conflicts of interest or biases 
for all authors or contributors; (vi) When the subject of the article is an unlabeled use, or the 
article contains other information that is different from approved labeling, the industry sponsor 
disseminating the reprint must disclose that the reprint includes information that has not been 
approved by the FDA and attach a copy of the FDA-approved professional labeling with the 
reprint; (vii) If financial support for the study and/or the author(s) was provided by the industry 
sponsor disseminating the article, and this is not already stated in the article, then this information 
should be clearly disclosed with the reprint. (b) Reprints of monographs or chapters from the 
three compendia (AMA’s Drug Evaluations; United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information, 
Volume I; and American Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information) named in federal statutes 
for determining the medical acceptability of unlabeled uses, provided: (i) The monograph or 
chapter is reprinted in its entirety by the publisher of the compendia, and the reprints are then 
sent to the requesting industry sponsor; (ii) The reprints are not altered in any way by the industry 
sponsor; (iii) The industry sponsor disseminating the reprint discloses that the reprint includes 
information that has not been approved by the FDA and attaches a copy of the FDA-approved 
professional labeling with the reprint. (c) Complete textbooks that meet the following criteria: (i) 
The reference text should not have been written, edited, excerpted, or published specifically for, 
or at the request of, a drug, device, or biologic firm; when financial support is provided by a drug, 
device, or biologic firm, it should be disclosed clearly in the textbook; (ii) The content of the 
reference text should not have been edited or significantly influenced by a drug, device, or 
biologic firm, or agent thereof; (iii) The reference text should be generally available for sale in 
bookstores or other distribution channels where similar books are normally available and should 
not be distributed only or primarily through drug, device, or biologic firms; (iv) The reference text 
should not focus primarily on any particular drug(s), device(s), or biologic(s) of the disseminating 
company, nor should it have a significant focus on unapproved uses of drug(s), device(s), or 
biologic(s) marketed or under investigation by the firm supporting the dissemination of the text; (v) 
Specific product information (other than the approved package insert) should not be physically 
appended to the reference text. (d) Manufacturers should report to the FDA and share with all 
physicians any proprietary information that a drug is ineffective or unsafe when used for a specific 
unlabeled indication. (e) Continuing medical education (CME) activities: (i) The FDA should 
continue to support principles in the FDA Draft Policy Statement on Industry-Supported Scientific 
and Educational Activities (Fed. Reg. 1992;57:56412-56414), which acknowledges the 
importance of relying on the professional health-care communities, rather than the Agency, to 
monitor independent provider activities; and (ii) The FDA should continue a policy of regulatory 
deference for industry-supported CME activities conducted by organizations accredited by the 
Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), state medical societies, 
specialty societies, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), that follow the 
Essentials and Standards of the ACCME and that may be certified for AMA PRA credit under the 
auspices of the American Medical Association Physician’s Recognition Award program. (4) 
Physicians have the responsibility to interpret and put into context information received from any 
source, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, before making clinical decisions (e.g., 
prescribing a drug for an unlabeled use).Improving the Supplemental New Drug Application 
(SNDA) Process (5) Our AMA strongly supports the addition to FDA-approved labeling those 
uses of drugs for which safety and efficacy have been demonstrated. (6) Our AMA encourages 
the US Congress, the FDA, pharmaceutical manufacturers, the United States Pharmacopeia, 
patient organizations, and medical specialty societies to work together to ensure that 
Supplemental New Drug Applications (SNDAs) for new indications (efficacy supplements), 
including those for uses in special populations (e.g., pediatrics), are submitted and acted upon in 
a timely manner. Specific recommendations include: (a) User fee legislation should be re-
authorized to ensure that the FDA has the necessary resources to act on all efficacy supplements 
within 6 months of submission; (b) The SNDA process should be streamlined as much as 
possible (e.g., basing review decisions on already published literature), without compromising the 
requirements for substantial evidence of efficacy and safety; (c) Legislation should be enacted 
that provides extensions of marketing exclusivity for the product to manufacturers who submit and 
gain FDA approval of efficacy supplements, including mechanisms both to provide greater reward 
when the new indication is for a life-threatening disease (with limited or no alternatives), an 
orphan disease, or for a special population (e.g., pediatrics), and to prevent inappropriate use of 
the system by manufacturers (e.g., place a limit on total length of extended marketing exclusivity); 
(d) For drugs no longer under patent and for which generic versions are available, the FDA, other 
governmental agencies (e.g., the National Institutes of Health), the pharmaceutical industry, the 
United States Pharmacopeia, patient organizations, and medical specialty societies should 
discuss and mutually agree on alternative mechanisms to ensure that efficacy supplements will 
be submitted to and acted upon by the FDA in a timely manner; and (e) Pharmaceutical 
manufacturers are urged to seek FDA approval for pediatric uses through the FDA's 1994 
regulation that allows approval of pediatric uses based on adult efficacy studies (where the 
course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in both populations) and 
additional information for pediatric use, usually pharmacokinetic studies for determination of 
dosage (Fed. Reg. 1994:59:64240-64250).  
Encouraging Clinical Research in Pediatrics  
(7) Our AMA urges pharmaceutical manufacturers and the FDA to work with the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and experts in pediatric medicine to identify those investigational drugs 
that would have pediatric indications and set up a mechanism to ensure that necessary pediatric 
clinical studies are completed prior to submission of NDAs for approval of these drug products. 
Legislation should be enacted that provides extensions of marketing exclusivity for the product to 
manufacturers who complete pediatric studies that lead to pediatric labeling (Res. 30, A-88;
