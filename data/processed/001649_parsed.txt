Smoke-Free Jurisdictions List August 2007
Page 1 of 4 
smokefreemeetings.cancer.gov 
In July 2006, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) announced a new smoke-free meeting 
policy requiring that all meetings and conferences organized or primarily sponsored by 
NCI be held in a state, county, city, or town that has adopted a comprehensive smoke-
free policy.  
 
For purposes of meeting planning, NCI considers a jurisdiction (state, city, town, or 
county) smokefree if it provides employees and the general public complete or near 
complete protection from secondhand smoke in enclosed workplaces, including 
restaurants.
