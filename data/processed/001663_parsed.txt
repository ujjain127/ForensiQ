SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) is issuing a license amendment to 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. for Materials License 
No. 29–30152–01, to authorize release of 
its facility in Monmouth Junction, New 
Jersey for unrestricted use. NRC has 
prepared an Environmental Assessment 
(EA) in support of this action in 
accordance with the requirements of 10 
CFR part 51. Based on the EA, the NRC 
has concluded that a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) is 
appropriate. The amendment will be 
issued following the publication of this 
Notice. 
II. EA Summary 
The purpose of the action is to 
authorize the release of the licensee’s 
Monmouth Junction, New Jersey facility 
for unrestricted use. Pharmacopeia, Inc. 
was authorized by NRC from February 
1999 to use radioactive materials for 
research and development purposes at 
the site. On April 28, 2004, 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. requested that NRC 
release the facility for unrestricted use. 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. has conducted 
surveys of the facility and provided 
information to the NRC to demonstrate 
that the site meets the license 
termination criteria in Subpart E of 10 
CFR part 20 for unrestricted use. 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. will continue 
licensed activities at another location, as 
authorized by the license. 
The NRC staff has prepared an EA in 
support of the license amendment. The 
facility was remediated and surveyed 
prior to the licensee requesting the 
license amendment. The NRC staff has 
reviewed the information and final 
status survey submitted by 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. Based on its review, 
the staff has determined that there are 
no additional remediation activities 
necessary to complete the proposed 
action. Therefore, the staff considered 
the impact of the residual radioactivity 
at the facility and concluded that since 
the residual radioactivity meets the 
requirements in Subpart E of 10 CFR 
Part 20, a Finding of No Significant 
Impact is appropriate. 
III. Finding of No Significant Impact 
The staff has prepared the EA 
(summarized above) in support of the 
license amendment to release the 
facility for unrestricted use. The NRC 
staff has evaluated Pharmacopeia, Inc.’’s 
request and the results of the surveys 
and has concluded that the completed 
action complies with the criteria in 
Subpart E of 10 CFR Part 20. The staff 
has found that the environmental 
impacts from the action are bounded by 
the impacts evaluated by NUREG–1496, 
Volumes 1–3, ‘‘Generic Environmental 
Impact Statement in Support of 
Rulemaking on Radiological Criteria for 
License Termination of NRC-Licensed 
Facilities’ (ML042310492, 
ML042320379, and ML042330385). On 
the basis of the EA, the NRC has 
concluded that the environmental 
impacts from the action are expected to 
be insignificant and has determined not 
to prepare an environmental impact 
statement for the action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) is issuing a license amendment to 
Material License No. SUB–1010 issued 
to Sequoyah Fuels Corporation (the 
licensee), to authorize the licensee to 
dewater existing raffinate sludge and 
temporarily store the dewatered sludge 
at its Gore, Oklahoma facility prior to 
final disposition. NRC has prepared an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) in 
support of this amendment in 
accordance with the requirements of 10 
CFR Part 51. Based on the EA, the NRC 
has concluded that a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) is 
appropriate. The amendment will be 
issued following the publication of this 
Notice. 
II. EA Summary 
The purpose of the proposed 
amendment is to authorize the licensee 
to dewater existing raffinate sludge and 
temporarily store the dewatered sludge 
at its Gore, Oklahoma facility prior to 
final disposition. Approximately 1 
million cubic feet of raffinate sludge 
was produced, as a waste, during the 
operation of the SFC facility. The 
sludge, which contains various metals 
in addition to uranium, thorium, and 
radium, is 15 to 20 percent solid 
material and is stored in three hypalon-
lined impoundments on the site. It must 
be dewatered prior to permanent 
disposal, either in an onsite disposal 
cell or offsite at a licensed disposal 
facility. The licensee proposes to 
dewater the raffinate sludge using a 
pressurized plate press filtering process. 
The equipment would be set up in an 
area near the impoundments containing 
the sludge and dismantled at the 
conclusion of the dewatering process. 
The dewatered sludge would be put into 
2200 pound capacity bags of woven 
polypropylene fabric and temporarily 
stored on a nearby concrete pad prior to 
final disposal. Temporary storage cells 
will be constructed on the concrete pad 
to contain the bags of raffinate sludge. 
The cells will be lined with 20 mil, high 
density cross-laminated polyethylene 
and covered with the same material. 
On January 7, 2004, Sequoyah Fuels 
Corporation requested that NRC approve 
the proposed amendment. The 
licensee’s request for the proposed 
change was previously noticed in the 
Federal Register on March 17, 2004 (69 
FR 12715), with a notice of an 
opportunity to request a hearing. 
The staff has prepared the EA in 
support of the proposed license 
amendment. The only environmental 
impact under normal conditions would 
be an increase in the radon 
concentration in the air at the site. 
However, the radon concentration at the 
site boundary would be well below the 
10 CFR Part 20 standard. There is also 
a potential for release of some material 
during adverse meteorological 
conditions. In the unlikely event of a 
tornado strike on the cells, some of the 
sludge can be dispersed, but it is 
unlikely that it would be carried offsite. 
The licensee would be required to clean 
up the dispersed material. Some severe 
precipitation events could result in 
release of some sludge to the nearby 
Illinois River and Robert S. Kerr 
Reservoir but concentrations are 
unlikely to exceed the standards for 
normal releases in 10 CFR Part 20. The 
staff has concluded that the proposed 
action, to dewater existing raffinate 
sludge and temporarily store it in lined 
and covered cells, will result in minimal 
environmental impacts. Radon levels 
will be increased but will remain well 
within regulatory limits. In addition, 
there is the potential, under unusual 
conditions (e.g., during a severe storm), 
of releasing small amounts of 
contaminants in low concentrations, to 
the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. 
III. Finding of No Significant Impact 
On the basis of the EA, NRC has 
concluded that there are no significant 
environmental impacts from the 
proposed amendment and has 
determined not to prepare an 
environmental impact statement.
