Trends in Brand Name and Generic 
Prescribed Medicine Utilization and 
Expenditures, 1999 and 2003 
Highlights 
 
The proportion of the civilian 
noninstitutionalized popula-
tion purchasing a brand 
name prescribed medicine 
increased from 47.5 percent 
to 53.4 percent when com-
paring the years 1999 and 
2003; the proportion of the 
population purchasing a ge-
neric prescribed medicine did 
not change significantly when 
comparing the two years.   
 
From 1999 to 2003, the 
number of total purchases   
of brand name and generic 
prescribed medicines by the 
community population in-
creased from 1.3 billion to  
1.7 billion purchases for 
brand name drugs and from 
0.8 billion to 1.1 billion pur-
chases for generic drugs. 
 
Among the community popu-
lation, total expenditures for 
brand name prescribed medi-
cines and generic prescribed 
medicines nearly doubled in 
the five-year span from 1999 
to 2003, going from $75.5 
billion to $141.0 billion for 
brand name drugs and from 
$18.8 billion to $36.6 billion 
for generics. 
 
In the five years from 1999 to 
2003, the average expense 
per purchase for brand name 
and generic prescribed medi-
cines increased, with the 
average expense for a brand 
name rising from $59.49 to 
$82.53, and the average ex-
pense for a generic rising 
from $23.48 to $33.53.

Introduction 
 
This Statistical Brief presents data from the Household Component 
of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS-HC) on brand 
name and generic prescribed medicine utilization and expenditures 
in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized (community) population in 
1999 and 2003. Estimates were derived from the 1999 and 2003 
MEPS prescribed medicines (PMED) files.  
 
Only prescribed drugs obtained in an outpatient setting are included 
in the estimates provided in this brief. Insulin and diabetic supplies 
and equipment are included in MEPS prescribed medicines 
estimates. Over-the-counter medicines are excluded from these 
estimates as are prescription medicines administered in an inpatient 
setting or in a clinic or physician’s office. Expenditures are in 
nominal dollars. All differences discussed in the text are statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level. 
 
Findings 
 
In 1999, 47.5 percent of the 276.4 million persons in the U.S. civilian 
noninstitutionalized (community) population purchased at least one 
brand name prescribed medicine during the year, and 46.9 percent 
purchased at least one generic prescribed medicine during the year. 
By 2003, the U.S. community population had grown to 290.6 million 
persons, and the proportion of persons purchasing at least one 
brand name drug increased to 53.4 percent. However, the 
proportion purchasing at least one generic drug did not change 
significantly when comparing the years 1999 and 2003. (figure 1)  
 
Utilization of brand name prescribed drugs rose from 1.3 billion 
purchases to 1.7 billion purchases in the five-year span from 1999 
to 2003. Generic drugs also increased in utilization, rising from 0.8 
billion purchases to 1.1 billion purchases from 1999 to 2003. (figure 
2)  
 
When comparing the years 1999 and 2003, total expenditures 
increased significantly for both brand name and generic prescribed 
medicines. Brand name drugs total expenditures increased from 
$75.5 billion to $141.0 billion, and generic drugs total expenditures increased from $18.8 billion dollars to 
$36.6 billion. (figure 3) 
 
In 1999, the average expense per purchase for a brand name prescribed drug was $59.49, and the 
average expense for a generic drug was $23.48. Five years later, in 2003, the average expense 
increased to $82.53 for a brand name drug and $33.53 for a generic drug. (figure 4) 
 
Definitions 
 
Brand name and generic prescribed drugs 
Brand name and generic status was identified by linking the 1999 and 2003 MEPS Prescribed Medicines 
Files to the Master Drug DataBase, which is published by Medi-Span, for corresponding years. The Medi-
Span Master Drug DataBase includes a Multi-Source Code variable. This variable allows a prescribed 
drug to be designated as 1) single-source, no generics available; 2) single-source, co-licensed; 3) original 
product, generic available; and 4) considered generic, multiple sources. For this brief, drugs falling into 
categories 1, 2, and 3 were considered brand name drugs, and drugs falling into category 4 were 
considered generic drugs.    
 
Expenditures 
Expenditures are in nominal dollars. 
 
About MEPS-HC 
 
MEPS-HC is a nationally representative longitudinal survey that collects detailed information on health 
care utilization and expenditures, health insurance, and health status, as well as a wide variety of social, 
demographic, and economic characteristics for the civilian noninstitutionalized population. It is 
cosponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Center for Health 
Statistics.
