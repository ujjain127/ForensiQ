Smoke and Pollution Aerosol
Effect on Cloud Cover
Yoram J. Kaufman1 and Ilan Koren2*
Pollution and smoke aerosols can increase or decrease the cloud cover. This duality in the effects of
aerosols forms one of the largest uncertainties in climate research. Using solar measurements from
Aerosol Robotic Network sites around the globe, we show an increase in cloud cover with an increase
in the aerosol column concentration and an inverse dependence on the aerosol absorption of sunlight.
The emerging rule appears to be independent of geographical location or aerosol type, thus
increasing our confidence in the understanding of these aerosol effects on the clouds and climate.
Preliminary estimates suggest an increase of 5% in cloud cover.
A
erosol particles originating from urban
and industrial pollution or smoke from
fires have been shown to affect cloud
microphysics, cloud reflection of sunlight to
space, and the onset of precipitation (1, 2). De-
lays in the onset of precipitation can increase
the cloud lifetime and thereby increase cloud
cover (3, 4). Research on the aerosol effect on
clouds and precipitation has been conducted
for half a century (5). Although we well un-
derstand the aerosol effect on cloud droplet
size and reflectance, its impacts on cloud
dynamics and regional circulation are highly
uncertain (3, 5–9) because of limited observa-
tional information and complex processes that
are hard to simulate in atmospheric models
(10, 11). Indeed, global model estimates of the
radiative forcing due to the aerosol effect on
clouds range from 0 to –5 W/m2. The reduc-
tion of this uncertainty is a major challenge in
improving climate models.
Satellite measurements show strong systematic
correlations among aerosol loading, cloud cover
(12), and cloud height over the Atlantic Ocean (13)
and Europe (14), making the model estimates of
aerosol forcing even more uncertain. However,
heavy smoke over the Amazon forest (15) and pol-
lution over China (16) decrease the cloud cover by
heating the atmosphere and cooling the surface
(17) and may balance some of this large negative
forcing. Global climate models also show a reduc-
tion in cloud cover due to aerosol absorption (tabs)
outside (18) and inside the clouds (19). In addition,
the aerosol effect on slowing down the hydrolog-
ical cycle by cooling parts of the oceans (1) may
further reduce cloud formation and the aerosol
forcing. Understanding these aerosol effects on
clouds and climate requires concentrated efforts
of measurement and modeling of the effects.
There are several complications to devising a
strategy to measure the aerosol effect on clouds.
Although clouds are strongly affected by varying
concentrations of aerosol particles, they are driven
by atmospheric moisture and stability. Local var-
iations in atmospheric moisture can affect both
cloud formation and aerosol humidification, re-
sulting in apparent correlations between aerosol
column concentration and cloud cover (12, 13, 20).
In addition, chemical processing of sulfates in
clouds can affect the aerosol mass concentration
for aerosol dominated by sulfates.
We attempt to address these issues by intro-
ducing an additional measurement dimension. We
stratified the measurements of the aerosol effect
on cloud cover as a function of tabs of sunlight,
thus merging in one experiment both the aerosol
enhancement and inhibition of cloud cover.
Because the concentration of the absorbing
component of aerosols is a function of the aerosol
chemical composition, rather than aerosol humid-
ification in the vicinity of clouds,this concentration
can serve as a signature for the aerosol effect on
clouds. A robust correlation of cloud cover with
aerosol column concentration and tabs in different
locations around the world can strengthen the
quantification of the aerosol effect on cloud
cover, though a direct cause-and-effect relation-
ship will await detailed model simulations.

The satellite analysis (12–16) may be affected
by potential cloud artifacts (21). Therefore, instead
of satellite data, we use measurements obtained by
Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sunpho-
tometers (22, 23) in 17 sites with long data records
and representing different aerosol and climatic
regimes (Fig. 1). AERONET measures the aerosol
attenuation of sunlight in cloud-free conditions.
Although the sunphotometer was not designed to
measure cloud cover, clouds affect the interval
between consecutive aerosol measurements. We
distinguished aerosols from clouds by using
spectral variability of three consecutive measure-
ments within 1 min (24). The interval is usually 15
min, but it is too variable to derive the actual cloud
cover; however, we can use a systematic variation
in the intervals with the aerosol optical thickness t
to derive the change in the cloud cover.
To develop the relationship between the cloud
cover and the interval of measurements, let N0 be
the instrumental average rate of measurements
per unit of time in the absence of clouds and N
be the rate of measurements for a given cloud
fraction fc so that
N 0 N0ð1 j fcÞ
ð1Þ
where fc is the fraction of the time in which the
sunphotometer will detect the cloud and not report
aerosol data. The intervals in the sunphotometer
measurements are correspondingly T 0 1/N and
T0 0 1/N0, where T is the interval between mea-
surements for fc and T0 is the interval between
measurements for a cloud-free sky. Therefore
fc 0 1 j T0
T
ð2Þ
Differentiating with respect to the logarithm
of t, a measure of the aerosol column concentra-
tion, gives
dfc
dlnt 0 T0
T 2
dT
dlnt or, using Eq: 2:
dfc
dlnt 0 1
T ð1 j fcÞ dT
dlnt
ð3Þ
where dfc/dlnt and dT/dlnt are the derivatives of
fc and T, with respect to the logarithm of t. As
the cloud field expands because of an increase in
the size or lifetime of the cloud, an overlap
among the clouds will mask part of the aerosol
effect proportionally to the cloud fraction. This
distorts the aerosol effect, particularly for high
cloud cover. Therefore, we defined the inde-
pendent cloud cover change dfci as
dfci 0
dfc
ð1 j fcÞ 0 dT
T
ð4Þ
and used it instead of dfc in this paper. We also
tested the AERONET-derived cloud cover against
total sky pyranometer measurements (fig. S1).
Figure 2 shows three scatterplots of the in-
terval between adjacent AERONET measure-
ments as a function of t for different values of
tabs. For each site, 3 to 5 years_ worth of data
are separated for every 2 calendar months. We
also used the AERONET measurements of tabs
(25, 26). tabs is accurate within T0.01 for a sin-
gle calibration data set and within T0.003 for 5
years of data with approximately six indepen-
dent calibrations (25, 26). We used tabs rather
than a single scattering albedo because tabs has
very small sensitivity to possible cloud contam-
ination and aerosol humidification. Subvisible
clouds, although affecting the scattering in the
atmosphere, have almost no effect on absorption
and therefore have little influence on tabs. As the
aerosol concentration increases, both the scattering
and absorption increase, competing for their ef-
fects on the cloud cover. We provide the average
values of tabs for each data set (Figs. 2 and 3),

representing the value of absorption that competes
with the number of potential cloud condensation
nuclei in determining the cloud fraction.
In order to study the effect of pollution and
smoke aerosols, we restricted the data to locations
and periods with minimal dust influence. To have
enough points for each time increment, we also
restricted the data to cloud systems that passed
over the site during no more than 3 hours (27). As
a result, the observations were weighted toward
meteorological systems with broken clouds.
The results for the change in cloud cover
Dfci with a change in Dlnt are shown in Fig. 3
(see also table S1). Every point represents an
analysis of È3000 measurements. A linear fit
to all of the data shows that
Dfci
Dlnt 0 ð0:17 T 0:01Þ j ð3:5 T 0:5Þtabs ð5Þ
with a correlation of r 0 0.69.
Uncertainties are represented by the stan-
dard errors in the average values, and the 95%
confidence level range of the slopes is between
–2.6 and –4.4. There is a smooth transition
from aerosol enhancement of cloud cover to
aerosol decrease of the cloud cover (Fig. 3).
Does Eq. 5 represent the aerosol effect on
cloud cover, cloud processing of aerosols, or
coincidental variations of clouds and aerosol
with the meteorological field? To address this
question, we subdivided the data in Fig. 3A into
three geographical regions (colored stars in
Fig. 1): continental Northern Hemisphere sites
with pollution aerosols, coastal marine sites,
and biomass-burning sites in Africa and South
America (25, 26, 28). These regions differ in
aerosol and cloud properties; however, the slope
of Dfci/Dlnt versus tabs for these regions varies
within the uncertainty range of Eq. 5.
The fact that we have the same relationship
for smoke and pollution aerosol is of special
importance. Pollution aerosol is strongly hygro-
scopic, and thus variation in the humidity from
0% to 85% can triple the value of t (29). Smoke
is much less hygroscopic; an increase in the
humidity to 85% increases t by only 20% (30).
The similarity in the regressions shows that it is
unlikely that aerosol humidification in conditions
that favor cloud formation is responsible for the
increase of cloud cover with either an increase in
aerosol concentration or its decrease with the
introduction of tabs. The same can be said about
cloud processing, which affects pollution aerosol
through sulfate production, which is not impor-
tant for aerosols produced by biomass burning.
To address possible effects from seasonal vari-
ability, we subdivided the data in Fig. 3B based on
season (winter to spring and summer to fall) in
the Northern Hemisphere and year-long data in
the Tropics. Alternatively in Fig. 3C, weseparated
thedataby thecloud-top temperature(Tc) obtained
from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer (MODIS) satellite data (31, 32). In
all of these cases, the slopes of Dfci/Dlnt versus
tabs varied within the uncertainty of Eq. 5.
To what degree can the relationship in Eq. 5
be influenced by atmospheric dynamics? Con-
vergence zones and updrafts can increase the
depth of the boundary layer, the column con-
centration of aerosols, and total precipitable
water vapor. They can also promote cloud cover
(33). Analysis of aerosol and water vapor sep-
arately for each location and season shows sig-
nificant correlations between t and the total
precipitable water vapor (Fig. 3), which is a
possible indication of the effect of convergence.
The results, summarized in Table 1, show that
È25% of the relationship of Dfci with t may be
associated with variation of the precipitable water
vapor. As expected, the effects are stronger for

pollution aerosol in the Northern Hemisphere than
for biomass burning in the tropics, where the dry
season is associated with smaller meteorological
variability (34).
We found a consistent relationship between an
increase in the cloud fraction and an increase in t
(representing column concentration), as well as a
decrease in tabs. The relationship is invariant to
the location or to the aerosol type. About 25% of
the relationship of clouds to aerosol can be ex-
plained by the variation of total precipitable water
vapor and may be associated with atmospheric
convergence. What are the consequences of this
systematic effect of aerosol on the cloud cover?
We used the limited global sample of aerosol
interaction with clouds from Fig. 3 to roughly
estimate the global average anthropogenic aerosol
impact on cloud cover over the oceans. For a
global average aerosol (excluding dust) single
scattering albedo of 0.92 T 0.05 (25, 26) and an
average total optical depth value of t 0 0.093 T
0.02 over the oceansEcomposed oft 0 0.06 T 0.01
(for baseline natural aerosol) and t 0 0.033 T
0.01 (for anthropogenic aerosols) (35, 36)^, we
obtained a tabs value of 0.007 T 0.005. From
Table 1, we acquired a dfci/dlnt value of 0.11 T
0.02. Anthropogenic aerosol increases the fine
t over the oceans, which provide most of the
cloud condensation nucleii, from baseline values
of 0.03 T 0.01 to 0.065 T 0.02 (35, 36). For an
average cloud cover of 0.6, the increase in t
corresponds to a change in cloud cover of
Dfc 0 Dfcið1 j fcÞ 0 0:11 Dlnt ð1 j 0:6Þ
0 0:03 T 0:01
ð6Þ
The spatial distributions of aerosol over the
oceans and their absorption properties are highly
heterogeneous. Consequently, the estimated av-
erage impact is uncertain and should be viewed as
a first approximation. The clouds sampled by the
AERONET procedure do not include extended
cloud systems that are sensitive to aerosol effect.
The analysis applies to urban industrial pollution
and aerosol produced by biomass burning rather
than land-use–generated dust.
The relationship between cloud cover and
aerosol given by Eq. 5 can serve as a constraint
on models of the aerosol and cloud interaction,
independently of the cause-and-effect relationship.
The robustness of the effect of aerosols on clouds,
presented here, makes it more likely that most of
the observed changes in the cloud cover are due
to the aerosol impact. The large effect of elevated
aerosol concentration on cloud cover, an increase
of 0.03 (5%) in average cloud cover (Eq. 6), can
have a profound effect on the hydrological cycle
and climate.

Crustal Dilatation Observed by
GRACE After the 2004
Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake
Shin-Chan Han,1* C. K. Shum,1 Michael Bevis,1 Chen Ji,2 Chung-Yen Kuo1
We report the detection of an earthquake by a space-based measurement. The Gravity Recovery and
Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites observed a T15-microgalileo gravity change induced by the
great December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Coseismic deformation produces sudden
changes in the gravity field by vertical displacement of Earth’s layered density structure and by
changing the densities of the crust and mantle. GRACE’s sensitivity to the long spatial wavelength
of gravity changes resulted in roughly equal contributions of vertical displacement and dilatation
effects in the gravity measurements. The GRACE observations provide evidence of crustal dilatation
resulting from an undersea earthquake.
T
he devastating 26 December 2004 Sumatra-
Andaman undersea earthquake, with a
moment magnitude (Mw) between 9.1
and 9.3, ruptured more than 1000 km of a locked
subduction interface near northern Sumatra,
Nicobar, and the Andaman islands (1). Measure-
ments from global seismic network and Global
Positioning System (GPS) stations have been used
to infer the coseismic slip history of this event
(1–4). The earthquake permanently changed the
mass distribution within Earth and has conse-
quently perturbed the motion of Earth-orbiting
satellites by an amount that is measurable from the
ranging instrument onboard the Gravity Recovery
and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites (5).
GRACE consists of two identical satellites co-
orbiting at low altitude (È450 km), separated by
