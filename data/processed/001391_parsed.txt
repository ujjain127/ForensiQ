have an associated CMN for the 
beneficiary. Suppliers (those who bill 
for the items) complete the 
administrative information (e.g., 
patient’s name and address, items 
ordered, etc.) on each CMN. The 1994 
Amendments to the Social Security Act 
require that the supplier also provide a 
narrative description of the items 
ordered and all related accessories, their 
charge for each of these items, and the 
Medicare fee schedule allowance (where 
applicable). The supplier then sends the 
CMN to the treating physician or other 
clinicians (e.g., physician assistant, 
LPN, etc.) who completes questions 
pertaining to the beneficiary’s medical 
condition and signs the CMN. The 
physician or other clinician returns the 
CMN to the supplier who has the option 
to maintain a copy and then submits the 
CMN (paper or electronic) to CMS, 
along with a claim for reimbursement.

Request: Extension without change of a 
currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Withholding 
Medicare Payments to Recover 
Medicaid Overpayments and 
Supporting Regulations in 42 CFR 
44.31; Use: Overpayments may occur in 
either the Medicare and Medicaid 
program, at times resulting in a situation 
where an institution or person that 
provides services owes a repayment to 
one program while still receiving 
reimbursement from the other. Certain 
Medicaid providers which are subject to 
offsets for the collection of Medicaid 
overpayments may terminate or 
substantially reduce their participation 
in Medicaid, leaving the State Medicaid 
Agency unable to recover the amounts 
due. These information collection 
requirements give CMS the authority to 
recover Medicaid overpayments by 
offsetting payments due to a provider 
under the program. Form Number:

Frequency: On occasion; Affected 
Public: State, Local or Tribal

Medicare Program; Medicare Appeals;

controversy (AIC) threshold amounts for 
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) 
hearings and judicial review under the 
Medicare appeals process. The 
adjustment to the AIC threshold 
amounts will be effective for requests 
for ALJ hearings and judicial review 
filed on or after January 1, 2009. The 
2009 AIC threshold amounts are $120 
for ALJ hearings and $1,220 for judicial 
review. 
DATES: Effective Date: This notice is 
effective on January 1, 2009. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Liz 
Hosna, (410) 786–4993. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Section 1869(b)(1)(E) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act), as amended by 
section 521 of the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and 
Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), 
established the AIC threshold amounts 
for ALJ hearing requests and judicial 
review at $100 and $1000, respectively, 
for Medicare Part A and Part B appeals. 
Section 940 of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), 
amended section 1869(b)(1)(E) of the 
Act to require the AIC threshold 
amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial 
review to be adjusted annually. The AIC 
threshold amounts are to be adjusted, as 
of January 2005, by the percentage 
increase in the medical care component 
of the consumer price index for all 
urban consumers (U.S. city average) for 
July 2003 to July of the year preceding 
the year involved and rounded to the 
nearest multiple of $10. Section 
940(b)(2) of the MMA provided 
conforming amendments to apply the 
AIC adjustment requirement to 
Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage 
‘‘MA’’) appeals and certain health 
maintenance organization and 
competitive health plan appeals. Health 
care prepayment plans are also subject 
to MA appeals rules, including the AIC 
adjustment requirement. Section 101 of 
the MMA provides for the application of 
the AIC adjustment requirement to 
Medicare Part D appeals. 
A. Medicare Part A and Part B Appeals 
The statutory formula for the annual 
adjustment to the AIC threshold 
amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial 
review of Medicare Part A and Part B 
appeals, set forth at section 
1869(b)(1)(E) of the Act, is included in 
the applicable implementing 
regulations, 42 CFR Part 405, Subpart I, 
at § 405.1006(b). The regulations require 
the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services (the 
Secretary) to publish changes to the AIC 
threshold amounts in the Federal 
Register (§ 405.1006(b)(2)). In order to 
be entitled to a hearing before an ALJ, 
a party to a proceeding must meet the 
AIC requirements at § 405.1006(b). 
Similarly, a party must meet the AIC 
requirement at § 405.1006(c) at the time 
judicial review is requested for the court 
to have jurisdiction over the appeal 
(§ 405.1136(a)). 
B. Medicare Part C (Medicare 
Advantage) Appeals 
Section 940(b)(2) of the MMA applies 
the AIC adjustment requirement to Part 
C (MA) appeals by amending section 
1852(g)(5) of the Act. The implementing 
regulations for Medicare Part C appeals 
are found at 42 CFR Part 422, Subpart 
M. Specifically, § 422.600 and § 422.612 
discuss the AIC threshold amounts for 
ALJ hearings and judicial review. 
Section 422.600 grants any party to 
the reconsideration, except the MA 
organization, a right to an ALJ hearing 
as long as the amount remaining in 
controversy after reconsideration meets 
the threshold requirement established 
annually by the Secretary. Section 
422.612 states that any party, including 
the MA organization, may request 
judicial review if the amount in 
controversy meets the threshold 
requirement established annually by the 
Secretary. 
C. Health Maintenance Organizations, 
Competitive Medical Plans, and Health 
Care Prepayment Plans 
Section 1876(c)(5)(B) of the Act states 
that the annual adjustment to the AIC 
dollar amounts set forth in section 
1869(b)(1)(E) of the Act applies to 
certain beneficiary appeals within the 
context of health maintenance 
organizations and competitive medical 
plans. The applicable implementing 
regulations for Medicare Part C appeals 
are set forth in 42 CFR Part 422, Subpart 
M, and as discussed above, apply to 
these appeals. The Medicare Part C 
appeals rules also apply to health care 
prepayment plan appeals. 
D. Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug 
Plan) Appeals 
The annually adjusted AIC threshold 
amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial 
review that apply to Medicare Parts A, 
B, and C appeals also apply to Medicare 
Part D appeals. Section 101 of the MMA 
added section 1860D–4(h)(1) of the Act 
regarding Part D appeals. This statutory 
provision requires a prescription drug 
plan sponsor to meet the requirements 
set forth in sections 1852(g)(4) and (g)(5) 
of the Act, in a similar manner as MA 
organizations. As noted above, the 
annually adjusted AIC threshold 
requirement was added to section 
1852(g)(5) of the Act by section 
940(b)(2)(A) of the MMA. The 
implementing regulations for Medicare 
Part D appeals can be found at 42 CFR 
Part 423, Subpart M. The regulations 
impart at § 423.562(c) that unless the 
Part D appeals rules provide otherwise, 
the Part C appeals rules (including the 
annually adjusted AIC threshold 
amount) apply to Part D appeals to the 
extent they are appropriate. More 
specifically, § 423.610 and § 423.630 of 
the Part D appeals rules discuss the AIC 
threshold amounts for ALJ hearings and 
judicial review. Section 423.610(a)
