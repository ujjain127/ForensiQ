PROBLEM AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
 
 
Low streamflows are an increasing problem in Kansas and other areas of the United 
States.  As a result, smaller amounts of water are available for diversions to water supplies and 
wetlands, for inflows to reservoirs, for capture by wells in nearby aquifers, for sustaining aquatic 
wildlife, and for recreation.  Stream-aquifer interactions play an important role in the generation 
and maintenance of low streamflows.  Ground-water development in regional aquifers that 
discharge water to stream corridors and in alluvial aquifers immediately adjacent to streams is 
often a major factor responsible for low-flow periods.  However, consumption of ground water 
by phreatophytes in riparian zones could also be an important contributor to reduction of stream 
flow.  Recently, partly in response to concerns about water consumption, expensive measures for 
phreatophyte control have been advocated for stretches of rivers in western Kansas. 
Present understanding of phreatophyte activity in stream-aquifer systems in Kansas is 
insufficient to assess the magnitude of that activity.  This project is directed at refining 
methodologies for quantitative assessment of phreatophyte activity, and utilizing those methods 
to assess water savings as part of a demonstration of salt-cedar control measures along the 
Cimarron River.  Specifically, the major objectives for the project are to 1) refine methodologies 
for quantifying the consumption of ground water by phreatophytes, and 2) use these methods to 
determine ground-water savings produced by control of invasive phreatophytes (salt cedar and 
Russian olive) along a portion of the Cimarron River in Kansas.  An auxiliary objective of this 
work is to gather a detailed data set on the major fluxes in stream-aquifer systems that can serve 
as the basis for research proposals on the quantitative assessment of stream-aquifer interactions 
in settings common to the Great Plains. 
 
The six activities proposed for the fourth year of this project were as follows: 
1. Monitoring of water levels and meteorologic parameters at both the Larned Research Site 
and the Ashland Research Site;  
2. Monitoring of vadose-zone moisture during the growing season at the Larned and Ashland 
sites using the neutron probe, and the testing and deployment of a new generation of capacitance 
sensors for measurement of volumetric water content at the Ashland site;  
3. Determination of specific yield;

METHODOLOGY 
 
 
This work is being 
done at two Kansas 
Geological Survey 
(KGS)/Kansas State 
University (KSU) research 
sites: the Larned Research 
Site (LRS) located 
adjacent to the United 
States Geological Survey 
stream-gaging station on 
the Arkansas River near 
Larned in central Kansas, 
and the Ashland Research 
Site (ARS) located along 
the Cimarron River south 
of Ashland in southwest 
Kansas (Figure 1).  The 
KGS/KSU research team 
focused on the LRS in the first two years of 
the project and then expanded the scope of 
the project in year three to include the ARS.  
The vegetation at the LRS is dominated by 
phreatophytes that are native to the Arkansas 
River riparian zone (cottonwood, willow, and 
mulberry), while the ARS is dominated by 
invasive phreatophytes (salt cedar and 
Russian olive). 
 
A series of shallow wells have been 
installed at the LRS and ARS to monitor the 
position of the water table through time. All 
wells are equipped with integrated pressure 
transducer/datalogger units (In-Situ 
MiniTroll) that are programmed to take 
pressure-head readings every 15 minutes.  
Since riparian-zone wells can be overtopped 
during periods of high stream flow (at least 
 
3
10 wells at the LRS and one at the ARS have been overtopped in the course of this project), 
absolute pressure sensors are used at most wells (12 out of 19 wells at the LRS and all six wells 
at the ARS) instead of the standard gauge-pressure sensors. The absolute-pressure sensors 
measure the pressure exerted both by the height of the overlying column of water in the well and 
by the atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure component is removed using data from a barometer 
at the site. Figure 2 displays records from an absolute-pressure sensor in the riparian zone at the 
LRS prior to and after the barometric pressure correction. Manual measurements of water levels 
in the monitoring wells are taken biweekly during the summer and bimonthly otherwise to 
assess the performance of the pressure sensors and, if necessary, to adjust the calibration 
parameters.  Three barometers are maintained at each site, one of which is designated the site 
reference, to ensure data collection is not impacted by failure of a barometer. Barometer 
performance at each site is assessed through a comparison of the three site barometers.  In 
addition, a handheld barometer is used to assess sensor performance during site visits.  
A series of neutron-probe access tubes have been installed at each site (eight access tubes 
at the LRS and six at the ARS), so that volumetric water content can be measured at biweekly 
intervals during the growing season. Measurements in the access tubes are recorded with a 
neutron probe (Model 503 DR Hydroprobe Moisture Depth Gauge; Campbell Pacific Nuclear) 
using a count duration of 16 s and depth increments of either 0.076 m or 0.152 m. Standard 
counts are recorded in the field both prior to and after access tube measurements. The mean 
standard count for the duration of the study is used to convert each measured count to a count 
ratio (CR). The soil volumetric water content (m3 m−3), θ, corresponding to each measured count 
ratio is calculated with the calibration equation θ = 0.2929 × CR − 0.0117, which is based on 
laboratory calibrations and an adjustment for PVC pipe. 
In the summer of 2006 (fourth year of project), a new generation of capacitance sensors 
for the measurement of volumetric water content, Decagon ECH2O-TE sensors, was deployed in 
shallow pits at the ARS, each of which was adjacent to one of the ARS monitoring wells and 
neutron-probe access tubes.  The sensors were used to monitor volumetric water content, bulk 
electrical conductivity, and temperature for 8-16 hours at a 5-min logging interval.  A total of 
three pits were used and 15 probes were installed at differing depths (maximum depth of 1.07 m) 
in each pit.  At the end of the monitoring period, the sensors were removed and soil samples 
were taken from each sensor location. The soil samples were transported to a KSU laboratory for 
measurement of volumetric water content.  Prior to deployment, the electrical conductivity and 
temperature readings provided by the sensors were extensively evaluated at the KGS. 
Vertical profiles of specific conductance and temperature within individual wells were 
measured approximately monthly during the summer and once in the spring and fall in the LRS 
riparian-zone wells using a YSI Model 30 meter and a 50-ft cable.  Specific conductance and 
temperature were recorded at the same time interval as pressure head in two LRS and one ARS 
wells using integrated multiparameter probe/datalogger units (two In-Situ MP Troll 9000 units 
and one YSI 600SL Sonde).   
Weather stations (Hobo Weather Station logger and sensors, Onset Computer Corp.) 
were in operation at both sites during year four. The weather stations are equipped with sensors 
to measure precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, global irradiance [direct and diffuse 
solar irradiance], wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure. Data are averaged (air 
temperature, global irradiance, barometric pressure, and wind speed and direction) or summed 
(precipitation) and logged at a 15-minute interval. The only exception is the relative humidity 
sensor, which provides a single measurement at the end of the 15-minute interval. Potential

evapotranspiration is calculated from the meteorologic data using the Penman-Monteith equation 
(Allen et al., 1998). The wind speed and direction sensor failed abruptly at the LRS in 
November of 2005, causing the datalogger to shut down.  This sensor was replaced in year 
four. 
A steady periodic analytical solution for water-table fluctuations produced by periodic 
forcing, such as diurnal variations in evapotranspiration, was developed in year four following 
the approach of Townley (1995).  This solution was used to assess the impact of phreatophyte-
control activities and uncut phreatophytes on water-table fluctuations measured in the ARS 
wells.  
Additional funding was made available to project investigators in year four by the KGS 
for the purpose of developing a cooperative research program in ecohydrology with a plant 
physiologist at the University of Kansas (Joy Ward) and her postdoc (Jesse Nippert).  During 
the 2006 growing season, travel monies were provided by this project and the KGS to allow 
Nippert to travel to the ARS to collect data on water movement within the salt cedar. Nippert 
gathered data on water pressure within leaves, water loss from leaves, sources of leaf water, 
and various other mechanisms and parameters related to photosynthesis.  That data, in 
conjunction with the hydrologic data described earlier, allowed further insights to be obtained 
regarding water consumption by salt cedar.  
 
 
MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS   
 
The principal findings of the fourth 
year of the project will be briefly discussed in 
the context of the six activities proposed for 
year four: 
 
Activity 1: Monitoring of water levels and 
meteorologic parameters at both the Larned 
Research Site and the Ashland Research Site 
– Pressure-head measurements were obtained 
at 15-minute intervals at 19 wells at the LRS 
and six wells at the ARS. Meteorologic 
parameters were measured at 15-minute 
intervals at weather stations at both sites.  
There was no flow in the Arkansas River at 
the LRS for most of year four.  The three 
periods during which flow did occur were 
8/20-9/8/06, 1/2-1/20/07, and 2/20/07 
through the end of year four (2/28/07).  One 
well in the LRS network, LWPH1, was 
destroyed as a result of high river flows 
during the late August event (plans are 
underway to replace it). There was flow in 
the Cimarron River at the ARS throughout

much of the year.  However, there was an extended period of no flow from late spring to late 
summer as a result of a period of anomalously hot and dry conditions.  A paper primarily based 
on the LRS and ARS data was revised, accepted, and published in the journal Water Resources 
Research in year four (Butler et al., 2007). Figure 3A is a figure from that paper in which the link 
between the sapflow velocity measured in a LRS cottonwood and water-table fluctuations is 
illustrated (fluctuations are virtually nonexistent during period of low sapflow), while Figure 3B 
is a figure from the same paper that displays the diurnal water-table fluctuations typical of those 
observed during the growing season in five of the six wells at the ARS (all but well Ash32).  
The 2006 growing season was one of the hottest and driest on record for the vicinity of 
the ARS.  Daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum air temperature, as well as total daily 
precipitation, have been recorded in the town of Ashland (approx. 17 km north of ARS) since 
1900 (data provided by Mary Knapp, KS state climatologist). The high mean Tmax (31.2 °C) and 
low precipitation (251 mm)  during the 2006 growing season (4/1-10/1/06) were comparable to 
the great droughts of the 1930’s, the period of the driest and hottest consecutive growing seasons 
for the last century in the Ashland 
area.  In the long-term data set 
(1900-2006), six years had total 
growing season precipitation ≤ 
251 mm, and 20 years had mean 
Tmax ≥ 31.2 °C. However, only 
two years, 1934 and 1954, had 
both a mean Tmax ≥ 31.2 °C and 
precipitation ≤ 251 mm, the 
conditions recorded over the 
growing season in 2006.  Thus, 
the hydrologic data from the 2006 
growing season provided an 
excellent opportunity to assess the 
utilization of ground water by 
ARS vegetation during a severe 
drought. 
Figure 4A presents water-
level and related data from well 
Ash31 that are representative of 
conditions observed at the ARS 
wells during the 2006 growing 
season. A clear diurnal pattern of 
water-level fluctuations can be 
seen in the late spring and early 
summer. However, at four of the 
five ARS wells that display 
diurnal fluctuations, the 
magnitude of these fluctuations 
significantly decreased after the 
water table fell past the lowest

well Ash22 from 8/20-10/22/04 (from Butler et al., 2007). Inset is 
expanded view of five days from the record. Rises in the water 
table after 9/21 are primarily due to rises in river stage produced by 
seasonal decreases in upstream irrigation pumping and plant water 
use, and by upstream precipitation (only the two precipitation 
events marked on the figure [Ppt.] occurred at the site and neither 
exceeded a total of 0.01 m; first frost did not occur until 11/3).

position previously recorded during this study (Figure 4B), suggesting that the water table had 
fallen beyond the reach of the roots of the phreatophytic vegetation at the ARS, an interpretation 
similar to that proposed earlier to explain the disappearance of diurnal fluctuations with declines 
in the water table at the LRS (Butler et al., 2007). This sizable reduction in the magnitude of the 
diurnal fluctuations observed at well Ash31 is accompanied by a large decrease in the volumetric 
water content in the sand interval centered at 0.6 m below land surface (Figure 4A), suggesting 
that the vegetation may have increasingly utilized vadose-zone water as the water table dropped 
beyond the reach of its roots.  The plant physiology data collected by Nippert during the 2006 
growing season revealed that the salt cedars functioned at near their physiologic maximum 
throughout this entire period. An article describing the ecohydrologic data collected at the ARS 
during the 2006 growing season is currently in the review process.  
 
Activity 2: Monitoring of vadose-zone moisture during the growing season at the Larned and 
Ashland sites using the neutron probe, and the testing and deployment of a new generation of 
capacitance sensors for measurement of volumetric water content at the Ashland site – Vadose-
zone moisture was monitored biweekly during the growing season at eight locations (four 
adjacent to monitoring wells) at the LRS 
and six locations (adjacent to monitoring 
wells) at the ARS, as in the previous 
years of this project. Figure 4A provides 
an example of the data that were obtained 
at the ARS through this monitoring. 
 
The neutron-probe data provide 
valuable information about vertical and 
temporal changes in volumetric water 
content.  However, the coarse resolution, 
in both time and space, does limit the 
insights that can be obtained from these 
data. An important emphasis of year four 
was the investigation of the capability of 
a new generation of capacitance probes 
(Decagon ECH2O-TE) to provide 
measurements of volumetric water 
content at the same 15-minute interval as 
the water-level and meteorological 
sensors, even in the presence of the high 
soil and water salinity at the ARS (Butler 
et al., 2005). Nachabe et al. (2005) have 
demonstrated the potential use of such 
information for estimation of ground-
water consumption by phreatophytes.  
An extensive period of probe evaluation 
was carried out in the KGS laboratories 
(assessment of temperature and electrical 
conductivity [EC] measurements) and at 
the ARS (assessment of volumetric water

content measurements). The temperature measurements were found to be within the stated 
specifications in all tests performed at the KGS.  However, the EC measurements were found to 
be in error as a result of incorrect calibration relationships for moderate to high electrical 
conductivities.  After two rounds of correction of calibration relationships by the manufacturer, 
the EC measurements were found to be within the stated specifications.  After passing the 
temperature and EC assessments performed in the KGS laboratories, the probes were deployed at 
the ARS.  
 
A total of 45 probes were installed in three pits at the ARS (15 probes installed at 
differing depths in each pit).  Out of those 45 probes, only 16 had volumetric water content 
readings close (i.e. within the reported accuracy specification of the sensors) to laboratory 
determined volumetric water content measurements from soil samples taken at the same 
locations in the pit. Twenty-two of the 29 sensors that were not in agreement with the soil 
sample measurements were in materials with bulk EC values greater than 0.5 dS/m.  Twenty-
four sensors had EC values greater than 0.5 dS/m, only two of those had volumetric water 
content readings close to the laboratory measurements of the soil samples.  Not one sensor 
with a bulk EC value greater than 0.85 dS/m had a volumetric water content reading close to 
the soil sample measurement.  As a result of the poor performance of the sensors in the ARS 
pits, the decision was made not to deploy these sensors at the ARS. Alternative approaches for 
obtaining volumetric water content data at the same 15-minute interval as the water-level and 
meteorological sensors are currently under consideration. The Appendix provides further 
information about the field assessment of the Decagon probes at the ARS.  
 
Activity 3: Determination of specific yield – The analysis of volumetric-water-content and 
water-level data (Skaggs et al., 1978; Romano and Santini, 2002) can result in reasonable 
estimates of specific yield (SY) as shown in previous years of this project (McKay et al., 2004; 
Keller et al., 2005). However, that approach does not appear viable at the ARS because the 
finer texture of the ARS sediments do not allow the periods of rapid soil-moisture change 
required by the method (needed so that soil-moisture changes due to drainage/wetting will 
dominate over changes produced by plant water use). Instead, SY estimates were obtained for 
the ARS by simulating vertical water movement and then using the simulated results to 
evaluate the terms in Eq. [22] of Raats and Gardner (1974). Numerical simulations of one-
dimensional vertical water movement were performed with HYDRUS-1D (Simunek et al., 
2005) for a range of fluxes and for both falling and rising water tables. The soil hydraulic 
properties required for those simulations were estimated using ROSETTA (ver. 1.2), a 
software package for evaluating the hierarchical pedotransfer functions of Schaap et al. (1998, 
2001). Specifically, hydraulic properties were estimated with the ROSETTA pedotransfer 
function model that uses soil particle size (sand, silt, and clay percentages) as input. Particle 
size data were obtained from soil samples collected in the vicinity of each of the ARS wells in 
the third year of this project (see Year Three Report). The KSU Soil Characterization 
Laboratory completed particle size analysis of those samples early in year four. 
Example results for well Ash12 (Figure 5) show that SY generally increases with 
increasing depth to water for the case of a falling water table.  Whereas uniform soil results in 
a monotonic increase in SY with increasing depth to water, the results for well Ash12 clearly 
show deviations from monotonic behavior. This is a direct result of vertical variations in soil 
texture, which cause soil hydraulic properties to vary with depth throughout the profile. The 
 
9
results in Figure 5 also show that 
specific yield depends on the 
magnitude of the flux across the 
water table. In addition, well Ash12 
results for the case of a rising water 
table (not shown) revealed that 
estimates of SY are influenced by the 
direction of water table movement. 
It is clear from these results that SY 
is not a static property. For a given 
water table depth and soil texture, 
specific yield varies with the 
direction of water table movement 
and the magnitude of the flux across 
the water table. A distinct advantage 
of the method described here for 
estimating SY is that it explicitly 
accounts for transient effects due to 
the motion of the water table and 
the flux of water across the water 
table. 
 
Activity 4: Assessing the rate of 
ground-water consumption by 
shallow-rooted vegetation and direct 
evaporation at the Ashland site – 
Limited progress was made on this 
activity in year four as a result of the 
unsuitable weather conditions during the 2006 growing season and the unexpectedly large 
amount of time required for the sensor assessment described in Activity 2 in the early summer of 
2006.  In late June of 2006, the diurnal fluctuations virtually ceased at two (Ash21 and Ash31) of 
the three wells that were to be used for this activity (e.g., Figure 4B), thus making it impossible 
to pursue the planned experiments after that time.  However, some insight into the relative 
contributions of ground-water consumption by shallow-rooted vegetation and direct evaporation 
was obtained from the analytical solution described in Activity 5 and previously collected water-
level data. 
 
Activity 5: Modeling of water flow under unsaturated and saturated conditions in the vicinity of 
selected wells at the Ashland site – This activity was a major focus of the latter half of year four.  
As described in previous reports (e.g., Butler et al., 2005), the ARS is subdivided into four plots 
of approximately four hectares each in which different salt-cedar control measures are being 
applied. Control measures are not used in Plot 1 (wells Ash11 and Ash12) so that data unaffected 
by those measures can be obtained throughout the project. Water-level data collected prior to any 
control activities clearly indicate that the magnitude of the water-table fluctuations is highly 
dependent on the apparent vitality of the phreatophyte community in the vicinity of each well

(Butler et al., 2005, 2007). Salt-cedar control measures began to be implemented at the ARS in 
March of 2005. At that time, Plots 2-4 were clear cut except for circles ranging from 20-30 m in 
radius, centered at each well. The radii of those circles of vegetation were progressively reduced 
through repeated cuttings in the summer of 2005 until the vegetation circles were completely 
removed on August 9, 2005.  Only the invasive phreatophytes were cut at the site; grasses, forbs, 
and low-lying bushes were largely unaffected.  A chemical treatment (Remedy 
and diesel-fuel mix) was applied to the salt-cedar regrowth in Plot 2 (wells Ash21 and Ash22) 
following the cutting, but no chemical treatment was applied in Plot 3 (wells Ash31 and Ash32). 
Water levels, volumetric water content, and meteorological parameters were monitored before, 
during, and after these control activities. Note that no wells were installed in Plot 4 because of 
the eventual planned burn in that plot. 
The initial expectation was that the diurnal fluctuations would virtually cease after the 
cutting.  However, 
as illustrated in 
Figure 6 for well 
Ash22, that 
expectation was 
not realized at any 
of the ARS wells 
at which 
fluctuations were 
observed prior to 
cutting (Ash21, 
Ash22, and 
Ash31).  Possible 
explanations for 
the continued 
fluctuations 
include ground-
water 
consumption by 
the uncut grasses, 
forbs, and small 
bushes, and by 
direct evaporation 
from the water table in the vicinity of the well, and ground-water consumption by invasive 
phreatophytes outside of the cut area.  In order to assess the possibility of this latter mechanism, 
steady periodic analytical solutions for water-table fluctuations produced by diurnal variations 
in evapotranspiration were developed by extending the general approach described in Townley 
(1995) to the configuration illustrated in Figures 7A-B.  Of particular interest is the solution 
for which R1 goes to zero (vegetation circle completely removed). Substituting reasonable 
parameters for the ARS into that solution revealed that fluctuations at the central well produced 
by the invasive phreatophytes outside the circle of cut vegetation should greatly differ in both 
amplitude and phase from those produced by vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the well.  
The data plotted in Figures 6A-B show that such a difference was not observed. Thus, it is 
considered unlikely that ground-water consumption by invasive phreatophytes outside the cut

Activity 6: Reassessing 
the ground-water 
savings obtained 
through phreatophyte-
control efforts at the 
Ashland site – The 
ground-water savings 
achieved through 
phreatophyte-control 
activities at the ARS 
were estimated using an 
approach, developed in 
this work, based on 
ratios of the White 
equation (White, 1932; 
Loheide et al., 2005). 
This approach is illustrated in Figure 8 where ETG is the evapotranspirative consumption of 
ground water 
expressed as a daily 
rate, SY is the 
readily available 
specific yield 
(dimensionless), r is 
the net inflow 
calculated from the 
night-time 
(midnight to 4 
A.M.) recovery of

expressed as a daily 
rate, and s is the net 
change in water-

one day expressed

as a daily rate (by convention positive with decrease in water-table elevation).  The ratio in the 
numerator of the left-hand side of the expression in Figure 8 characterizes the changes in ETG 
at Ash22 between the pre-cut and post-cut periods. A similar ratio in the denominator of the 
left-hand side characterizes the changes in ETG at Ash12 between these same periods.  The 
changes in Ash12 reflect the impact on ETG of factors other than the phreatophyte-control 
activities.  The right-hand side of the expression in Figure 8 is obtained by substituting the 
White equation for each ETG term.  Because the same depth intervals were used for the pre-cut 
and post-cut periods (e.g., Figure 6), SY cancels out in both the numerator and the 
denominator. 
The reductions in ETG calculated with the ratio approach illustrated in Figure 8 varied 
between the three wells (Ash21, Ash22, and Ash31) from 23-56% in the month immediately 
following cutting (time intervals shown in Figure 6 – average of three wells was 40%) .  
However, an analysis using the same depth intervals in 2006 (June 9-13) found that the 
reductions varied from 2-42% (average of three wells was 22%). Thus, the reduction in ETG 
gained from the phreatophyte-control activities appears to be decreasing with time, despite the 
severe drought 
conditions 
experienced 
during the 
2006 growing 
season. This 
decreased 
reduction in 
ETG may be a 
result of 1) 
increased 
growth (and 
thus water 
use) of 
grasses, forbs, 
and small 
bushes due to 
increased 
exposure to 
sunlight as a 
result of the 
removal of the 
large 
phreatophytes, 
2) increased direct evaporation from the water table due to the increased exposure of the land 
surface to sunlight, and 3) regrowth of salt cedar (both plots have experienced regrowth 
following the initial application of control activities).  Future work of this project will be directed 
at assessing the relative importance of ground-water consumption by these various mechanisms. 
Unless the impact of these mechanisms is better understood, it will be difficult to reliably 
estimate the potential water savings to be achieved through control of invasive phreatophytes.  
Note that the salt cedar regrowth in plot 3 was cut on September 7, 2006. Monitoring will

INFORMATION TRANSFER 
 
 
Eleven presentations concerning this project were presented at various venues both 
within and outside of Kansas during year four, including the 2006 Tamarisk Research 
Conference in Fort Collins, Colorado. Two of these presentations were part of the 2007 Henry 
Darcy Distinguished Lectureship that was awarded to James Butler. Early in year five, Butler 
presented additional Darcy lectures on this project at universities and research institutes in the 
United States, China, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the United 
Kingdom.  Additional lectures will be presented later in the year at universities and research 
institutes in the United States and Canada. One manuscript describing the results of the field 
investigation of phreatophyte-induced fluctuations in the water table was published in the journal 
Water Resources Research.  An additional manuscript on the summer 2006 work at the Ashland 
Research Site is currently in review. 
 
 
STUDENT SUPPORT  
 
Three students participating in the Applied Geohydrology Summer Research 
Assistantship Program of the Kansas Geological Survey were partially supported from this grant 
during the summer of 2006.  These students contributed to the aspects of the project involving 
water-level and vadose-zone monitoring, conductance measurements, Decagon probe laboratory 
and field assessment, and weather-station upkeep.  One student, Angela Cook from the 
University of Colorado at Boulder, presented a poster on a portion of the summer work at the 
Fall Conference of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco in December of 2006. One 
KSU undergraduate participating in the Agronomy Undergraduate Research Assistantship 
Program assisted with vadose-zone monitoring and Decagon probe field assessment.

Appendix - Report on Field Assessment of Decagon ECH2O-TE Sensors 
 
 
Summary 
On 6/28- 6/30/06, a KGS/KSU research team conducted a field assessment of the 
Decagon ECH2O-TE sensors at the Ashland Research Site in southwestern Kansas. We 
installed the sensors in pits adjacent to three monitoring sites and monitored volumetric water 
content, bulk electrical conductivity, and temperature for 8-16 hours using a 5-min logging 
interval.  A total of three pits were used and 15 probes were installed at differing depths in 
each pit.  At the end of the monitoring period, the sensors were removed and soil samples 
were taken from the same depth intervals. The samples were then taken to the lab for 
measurement of volumetric water content.  Out of the 45 sensors, only 16 had soil moisture 
readings close (i.e. within the reported accuracy specifications of the sensors) to the soil 
moisture measurements obtained in the laboratory. Twenty-two of the 29 sensors that were not 
in agreement with the measurements were in materials with bulk EC values greater than 0.5 
dS/m.  Twenty-four sensors had EC values greater than 0.5 dS/m – only two of those had soil 
moisture values close to the measurements.  Not one sensor with a bulk EC value greater than 
0.85 dS/m had a soil moisture reading close to the measurement.  In the following sections, we 
provide further details about the site and the sampling methods. 
 
 
 
Site Overview 
 
The Ashland Research Site (ARS) is located along the Cimarron River in southwestern 
Kansas a few miles north of the Oklahoma border (Figure 1).  Since August of 2004, the 
Kansas Geological Survey and Kansas State University have been studying water-use by 
phreatophytes and the efficacy of various salt-cedar control measures at the site.  We have 
installed a network of shallow water-table wells and neutron-probe access tubes along with a 
weather station.  Each well is paired with a neutron-probe access tube that is located within 5 ft 
of the well.  The well and access tube pairing will be designated as a monitoring site in this 
report. We monitor water-table position and various meteorological parameters at a 15-minute 
interval throughout the year, while soil moisture is measured on a biweekly basis during the 
growing season.  We want to use the Decagon sensors to obtain information on temporal 
variations in soil moisture over the same time interval used for the water-level and 
meteorological data.

Installation and Sampling Procedures 
Sensor Installation 
 
On the evening of 6/28 and the morning of 6/29, we dug two pits (Ash32 and Ash21) at 
the site with a backhoe and one shallow pit (Ash22) with shovels. Each pit was adjacent 
(within 15-20 ft) to the monitoring site from which it derived its name. Beginning in the 
morning of 6/29, we installed 15 sensors in each pit (Figure 2) following the instructions 
outlined in the sensor manual.  In general, sensor installation went smoothly.  Once installed, 
the sensors were programmed to log at a 5-minute interval. During daylight hours, we 
periodically went to each pit and sprayed the pit faces with a light mist of water to prevent 
excessive drying of the soil exposed at the pit faces.

Sensor Removal and Soil Sampling 
 
We began to remove the sensors late in the afternoon of 6/29. We removed the sensors 
in the order in which they were installed.  All the sensors were removed from pit Ash32 in the 
late afternoon of 6/29.  The sensors were removed from pits Ash21 and Ash22 in the morning 
and early afternoon of 6/30. As the sensors were removed, soil samples were taken adjacent to 
the position of the sensors using a pair of sampling rings. Figure 3 shows the orientation (top 
view) of sampling rings relative to the sensor.  The sampling rings were made from thin-wall 
aluminum tubing.  The height of each ring was 5.0 cm, the diameter was 4.8 cm, so the 
volume of each was 90.5 cm3, giving a total sample volume of 181 cm3.  The bottom edge of 
each ring was beveled to form a cutting edge.  The rings were placed in position after forming 
a smooth, level surface approximately 2.5 cm above the level of the sensor "blades" (Figure 4 
shows surface immediately prior to sampling at pit Ash32).  Rings were vertically driven into 
the soil by tapping.  A small block of wood was placed on the ring, and then a hammer was 
used to deliver light blows to the block.  After insertion, the bottom edge of the rings ended up 
approximately 2.5 cm below the level of the sensor "blades".  In soil layers with higher clay 
content, a light coating of WD-40 was applied to the exterior of the sampling rings.  Care was 
taken to avoid getting lubricant on the interior surface of the rings.  We experienced little to no 
problems with compaction of the samples.  The position of the rings was adjusted slightly in a 
few instances to avoid roots and other irregularities.  
The sensor was removed after the rings were driven to depth and a small masonry 
trowel was inserted beneath a ring to shear off the sample and lift it out.  Additional trimming 
 
20
(with edge of trowel) was required on occasion to ensure that the bottom of the sample was 
level with the bottom of the sampling ring. The soil from both rings was placed in a soil 
moisture tin that was stored in an insulated container.

Soil Moisture Determination 
Soil moisture tins remained in the insulated container until they could be weighed.  
Samples were weighed in the field after all the samples were removed from a pit and checks 
(i.e. some samples were weighed immediately after removal from pit) were performed to 
ensure that the samples did not lose water before weights were recorded.  A calibration weight 
was used to confirm that transport of the balance to the ARS did not affect balance calibration.  
The samples were then transported back to KSU. 
Samples were weighed in Kluitenberg’s laboratory at KSU (using the same balance) 
after drying at 105 deg C for 36 hours.  Weight checks were performed to confirm that 
moisture loss had ceased prior to final weight determinations.  Gravimetric water content was 
calculated as mass of water per mass of oven-dried soil material.  Mass of oven-dried soil 
material and total sample volume (combined volume of two rings) was used to calculate bulk 
density.  Volumetric water content was calculated as the product of the gravimetric water 
content and the bulk density. 
 
Comparison of Soil Moistures from Sensors and Samples 
 
Table 1 presents the comparison of the soil-moisture readings from the sensors with the 
values determined in the lab. The reported sensor values are averages obtained over the last 25 
minutes prior to sensor removal. The temperature and bulk EC values from the sensors are 
 
22
also reported.  At pit Ash21, five sensors each were placed on three pit faces at six-inch 
intervals beginning at six inches below land surface. At pit Ash22, five sensors each were 
placed on three pit faces at three-inch intervals beginning at six inches below land surface. At 
pit Ash32, seven sensors each were placed on two pit faces at six-inch intervals beginning at 
six inches below land surface with one additional sensor being placed on the second pit face a 
foot below land surface. 
At pit Ash21, five of the 15 sensors performed within specifications. There appeared to 
be a pattern of poorer agreement as the bulk EC increased. Some of the average soil moisture 
values from the sensors were also deemed to be outside of the range of physical plausibility for 
materials at that pit. Bulk density for this pit ranged from 1.42 to 1.63 g/cm3 (mean = 1.57 
g/cm3).  This corresponds to a range of 0.39 to 0.46 in total porosity, if a particle density of 
2.65 g/cm3 is assumed.  
At pit Ash22, only one of the 15 sensors performed within specifications and that was 
the one in the interval of lowest bulk EC at that pit.  Some of the average soil moistures from 
the sensors were again deemed to be outside of the range of physical plausibility for materials 
at that pit. Bulk density for this pit ranged from 1.27 to 1.55 g/cm3 (mean = 1.41 g/cm3), 
which corresponds to a range of 0.41 to 0.52 in total porosity. As is shown by the sample data 
in Tables 3 and 4, pit Ash22 had the highest EC and highest percentage of fine textured 
material of the three pits. 
 
At pit Ash32, 10 of the 15 sensors performed within specifications. The bulk EC values 
at this pit were relatively low.  The most common characteristic of the sensors functioning 
outside of specs was the relatively high EC of the material in which they had been placed. 
Only one of the six intervals with the highest bulk EC values reported at the pit had a sensor 
that performed within specs. Bulk density for this pit ranged from 1.35 to 1.66 g/cm3 (mean = 
1.54 g/cm3), which corresponds to a range of 0.37 to 0.49 in total porosity.

Soil Information 
Soil Type 
  
The ARS is located in an area mapped as a Lincoln-Krier complex, which means it 
contains a mixture of both Lincoln and Krier soils.  A detailed description of these soils can be 
found in the Clark County soil survey (USDA-SCS, 1982).  Note that the descriptions of the 
Lincoln and Krier series are for typical pedons.  They capture the distinguishing characteristics 
of these series, but are not exact descriptions of Lincoln and Krier pedons in the Lincoln-Krier 
 
24
complex at the ARS.    We did not attempt to identify the soils in each pit as we did not feel 
qualified to do so. 
 
 
 
Soil Texture 
 
On September 20-21, 2005, we collected soil samples at each monitoring site. At each 
site, four sampling locations were identified at a distance of approximately 10 feet from the 
water-table well.  Sampling locations were distributed as uniformly as possible around each 
well (ideal arrangement forming a square); however, the spatial arrangement varied from well 
to well due to the presence of salt cedar plants (live plants as well as crowns of treated plants) 
and landscape features.  
Samples were collected (2.75-inch-diameter bucket auger) from all four sampling 
locations in 6-inch depth intervals from the soil surface to the maximum depth allowable due to 
the presence of the water table.  The samples obtained from the four sampling locations were 
combined (composited) by depth interval in plastic buckets.  That is, all four samples from the 
0- to 6-inch depth interval were combined in a bucket, all four samples from the 6- to 12-inch 
depth interval were combined in a bucket, and so on.  After samples were obtained from all 
four locations, all of the soil material in each bucket was transferred to a sample bag, labeled 
with well number and depth interval.   
The samples were transported to the laboratory and dried at 50 °C for one week. 
Samples were crushed and then passed through a 2-mm sieve.  Large root fragments were 
removed and discarded prior to crushing.  Small root fragments were removed and discarded 
during the sieving process.  The material that passed through the 2-mm sieve was returned to 
the original sample bag.    
A sample splitter was used to obtain a subsample of approximately 16 ounces (liquid 
volume basis) for particle size analysis and a subsample of approximately 32 ounces (liquid 
volume basis) for chemical analysis.   
The subsamples for chemical analysis were submitted to the KSU Soil Testing 
Laboratory.  Table 2 contains results for the electrical conductivity of the solution extracted 
from a saturated paste.

Table 2 – Electrical conductivity of saturated extract 
 
The subsamples for particle size analysis were analyzed at the KSU Soil 
Characterization Laboratory.  All samples were subject to a pretreatment step of salt washing 
(removal of soluble salts).  In addition, several samples were subject to a pretreatment step for 
removal of organic matter.  Amounts of total sand and the various sand fractions (very fine, 
fine, medium, coarse, and very coarse sand) were determined by sieving.  Amounts of total 
clay, fine silt, and medium silt fractions were determined using sedimentation analysis in 
conjunction with the pipette method.  The amount of coarse silt in each sample was determined 
by difference.  Particle size analysis results are shown in Table 3.
