This research was sponsored by the Center for Indoor Air Research, Linthicum, MD,  
under contract no. ERD-88-812 with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 
managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp., Oak Ridge, TN,
for the U.S. Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC05-84OR9622464.
NRC Criterion No. 4:
Fairly Consistent Ratio
• Ratio relative to what?
• Many potential “constituents of concern”
• With exception of a few tobacco specific species, most other 
“COC” are found in indoor air with or without ETS present.
• Chemical stability
• Behavioral stability
Chemical Stability Issues
• Degradation at the same rate as the components of 
interest
• Nicotine degrades under high intensity UV
• Seems to be stable at normal lighting levels
• No chemical changes following collection
• Stability studies show nicotine stable up to 4 weeks
“Behavioral Stability” Issues
• “Nicotine seems to stick to everything”
• Adsorption and desorption into air
• Chamber studies have demonstrated adsorption to metal, 
glass, wood, sheet rock, clothing material, ventilation 
systems.
• Numerous examples of airborne nicotine with no obvious 
ETS present.
• Analytical methods for nicotine are designed to prevent 
adsorption on analytical system surfaces.
Emission Consistency
• Depends on the other components
• Tobacco nitrate levels will impact NOx but not nicotine.
• Solanesol is 4% of Argentinian ETS RSP, and 1.5% of 
Canadian ETS RSP.
• Aside from the tobacco specific compounds, other 
sources in real environments can be substantial, and 
mandate apportionment studies.

• Chamber Studies
• 3-EP = Solanesol = UVPM = FPM = RSP>> Nicotine
• Real-World Environments
• 3-EP=Solanesol>FPM>UVPM>Nicotine>>>RSP
ETS Levels and Exposure
• Nicotine continues to be employed as a marker 
because it can provide a semi-quantitative
estimate of overall ETS level, it is unique to 
tobacco, and it can be determined by active and 
passive sampling.
Examples of Area Sampling
Examples of Area Sampling
Larger, more sophisticated sampling equipment
Can use small equipment in a stationary mode
Area Monitoring
Area Monitoring
Advantages
Disadvantages
X Permits more sophisticated 
sampling and analysis systems to 
be used.
X Representative samples can be 
acquired despite knowledgeable 
target subjects.
X Only collects samples at a fixed 
location.
X Representative of human 
exposure only while subjects 
are in near vicinity of sampler 
location.

Personal Exposure Determinations
Advantages
Disadvantages
X Measures (through sample 
collection or real time analysis) the 
integrated concentration of 
airborne species actually in the 
breathing zone of the subject.
X Directly reflects human activity 
patterns.
X Number or size of systems 
which can be worn by the 
subject without seriously 
affecting activity is limited.
X Knowledgeable subjects may 
alter their behavior patterns
Area vs. Personal Sampling
• Prior to 1991, most major studies employed area 
monitoring
• Much less complex and costly
• Since 1992, large fraction of major studies have 
employed personal monitoring.
• Realization that humans move through a variety of 
micro-environments throughout the day.
Area vs. Personal Monitoring, cont.
• Head to head studies demonstrate that 
comparative statistics (group-wise) appear 
equivalent.
• On an individual basis, utility of area samples for 
prediction of personal exposure is limited.

Summary and Conclusions
• Fourth NRC Criterion, “consistent ratio” is where 
nicotine is “challenged.”
• Relative to which other components?
• High degree of surface adsorption, and some 
desorption.
• Emission consistency data suggests substantial 
variability.
• Seems best to use nicotine in conjunction with other 
markers.
Summary and Conclusions, continued
• Nicotine is used in a large number of studies
• Levels to which subjects are actually exposed (as 
determined from personal monitoring) tend to be 
lower than estimates from previous shorter 
duration studies or those where non-random 
subject selection is used.
• Area sampling probably only works for individual 
microenvironments.
