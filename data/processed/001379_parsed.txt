ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
 
 
Scour at bridge abutments can cause damage or failure of bridges and result in 
excessive repairs, loss of accessibility, or even death.  To mitigate abutment scour, both 
clear-water and live-bed laboratory experiments in a compound channel were performed 
using parallel walls and spur dikes as countermeasures, respectively. In addition, collars were 
tested under clear-water conditions only.  It was found that both parallel walls and spur dikes 
can efficiently protect the abutment from scour provided that they are properly designed. 
Design guidelines were discussed for both countermeasures. Preliminary clear-water tests of 
collars as countermeasures against scour showed some promising results although further 
tests are needed to determine their efficiency and design parameters.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Introduction 
 
Scour is the result of the erosive action of flowing water, excavating and carrying 
away material from the bed and banks of streams. Different materials scour at different rates. 
Loose granular soils are rapidly eroded under water action while cohesive or cemented soils 
are more scour-resistant. However, ultimate scour in cohesive or cemented soils can be as 
deep as scour in sand bed steams. Scour will reach its maximum depth in sand and gravel bed 
materials in hours; cohesive bed materials in days; glacial tills, poorly cemented sand stones 
and shales in months; hard dense and cemented sandstone or shales in years; and granites in 
centuries. Massive rock formations with few discontinuities can be highly resistant to scour 
and erosion during the lifetime of a typical bridge. Detailed discussion and equations for 
calculating all bridge scour components are presented in HEC-18 (Richardson and Davis, 
1995).  
 
Total scour at a highway crossing is comprised of the following three components: 
aggradation or degradation, contraction scour and local scour. Aggradation or degradation is 
long-term streambed elevation changes due to natural or human-induced causes within the 
reach of the river on which the bridge is located. Contraction scour involves the removal of 
material from the bed and banks across all or most of the width of the channel. This scour 
can result from a contraction of the flow by the approach embankments to the bridge 
encroaching onto the floodplain and/or into the main channel, from a change in downstream 
control of the water surface elevation, or from the location of the bridge in relation to a bend. 
In each case, scour is caused by an increase in transport of bed material in the bridge cross 
section. Local scour occurs around piers, abutments, spurs and embankments and is caused 
by the acceleration of the flow and the development of vortex systems induced by these 
obstructions to the flow.  
 
 
Bridge failures due to total scour at bridge foundations (i.e., bridge abutments and 
piers) have prompted a heightened interest in scour prediction and scour countermeasures. 
Data showed that the problem of scouring at bridge abutments is quite significant. 
 
1-2
Richardson et al. (1993) quoted a study produced in 1973 for the U.S. Federal Highway 
Administration that concluded of 383 bridge failures, 25% involved pier damage and 72% 
involved abutment damage. According to Melville (1992), of the 108 bridge failures 
surveyed in New Zealand during the period of 1960 –1984, 29 were attributed to abutment 
scour. Melville also mentioned that 70% of the expenditure on bridge failures in New 
Zealand was due to abutment scour. 
 
 
There have been several studies on pier scour and pier scour countermeasures. Some 
of these are Ettema (1980), Johnson (1994), Jones (1989), Lagasse et al. (2001), Mueller et 
al. (1999), Richardson et al. (1975, 1999, 2001). For bridge pier countermeasures, the 
NCHRP 24-7 (1998) project final report named “Countermeasures to Protect Bridge Piers 
from Scour” has reviewed nearly all the literature in this aspect and also has given 
recommendations and design suggestions for a number of countermeasures. Also the Federal 
Highway Administration has developed several comprehensive technical manuals (HEC-18, 
HEC-20 and HEC-23) for dealing with the problem of bridge scour. Moreover, a field survey 
of pier countermeasures was carried out across the United States.  
 
However, the scour at bridge abutments has received less attention, and 
countermeasures for abutment scour are greatly needed.  
 
1.2 Scope of Study 
 
After a review of the literature and a survey of practice by state department of 
transportation engineers by Barkdoll (unpublished data), some countermeasures emerged as 
worthy of further study. Selected countermeasures that reduce local scour at bridge 
abutments include armoring countermeasures, such as riprap and cable-tied blocks, river 
training countermeasures that prevent outflanking of the bridge opening, such as spur dikes 
and parallel walls, and some other innovative approaches including hinged slab/block 
systems, collars and vanes attached to the abutment.  
 
 
1-3
The ultimate aim of this study of countermeasures against scour at bridge abutments 
is to determine design guidelines for those countermeasures that are efficient in preventing or 
reducing local scour at the abutments of small county bridges, and through which bridge 
abutments can be well protected. The prerequisite to such guidelines is obtaining normalizing 
parameters that collapse experimental data and adequately scale model study results to field 
situations. Countermeasures that will be investigated here include spur dikes, parallel walls, 
and collars.  Since few countermeasures can totally eliminate scour for all of the complex 
situations that occur in natural rivers and for all of the various bridge configurations 
encountered, it becomes necessary that a goal of scour reduction be defined. For the purpose 
of this project, a primary goal is to identify countermeasures that reduce maximum local 
scour depth by 65 to 75 percent of the scour depth occurring at an unprotected abutment.  
 
An extensive study is presented on the effect of countermeasure length, alignment, 
relative position and material on protection efficiencies. Previous literature, which will be 
reviewed in Chapter 2 and 3, has revealed the primary parameters of spur dikes are protrusion 
length, number of spur dikes, distance between spur dikes, and angle to flow. The primary 
parameters for parallel walls are length, plan shape, and construction material. And the 
primary parameters for collars that are attached around piers are streamwise length, 
protrusion width, and vertical position of collar relative to the riverbed. These parameters of 
different countermeasures will be investigated experimentally under clear-water and live-bed 
scour 
conditions.

CHAPTER 2. A LITERATURE REVIEW ON BRIDGE ABUTMENT SCOUR 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
The problem of scour around bridge abutments has been identified as one with 
potentially catastrophic results. Excessive scour can cause abutment damage, which will 
result in the bridge failure and potential loss of life due to bridge collapse. Before considering 
any countermeasures, it is important to get as much information about the scour mechanism 
and parameters that affect local scour at bridge abutments as possible.  
 
2.2 Bridge Abutment Scour Mechanism 
 
The general scour mechanism at piers is well understood after several comprehensive 
studies including Melville (1975) and Ettema (1980), in which the principal downflow and 
the horse shoe vortices and the wake vortices induced by the presence of the pier are 
responsible for the scour around the structure. Recent studies of abutment scour by Wong 
(1982), Tey (1984), Kwan (1984, 1988), Kandasamy (1985, 1989), Dongol (1994) and many 
others have shown that the scour mechanism at abutments is very similar to the scour 
mechanism at piers. The downflow and the principal vortex at the upstream corner of the 
abutment, together with the secondary vortices and wake vortices at the middle part and the 
downstream corner of the abutment, cause complex interactions between the fluids and the 
bed material and are mainly responsible for the scour at abutments. Observations of flow 
patterns around abutments derived from flow visualization techniques using dye injection, 
dye crystals strategically placed on the sand bed, paper floats, smoke tunnel experiments by 
various researchers including Liu (1961), and Gill (1970) are summarized in Figure 2-1.   
 
In addition to the vortex systems, other mechanisms may exist to cause local scour. 
Hagerty and Parola (1992) reported that seepage effects could be very important to interact 
with turbulent vortices to aggravate local scour. The fluctuating pressure differences induced 
by the flow separation at abutments cause seepage into and out of the abutment foundation; 
seepage forces cause ejection of sediment particles from the bed where seepage emerges 
beside the abutment.

Figure 2-1: Flow patterns around a wing-wall abutment. 
 
Molinas et al. (1998) studied experimentally the shear stress distribution around 
vertical wall abutments. For Froude numbers ranging from 0.30 to 0.90 and for protrusion 
ratios of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 it was found that the highest values of shear stresses occur at the 
upstream abutment corner. In the experimental study, shear stresses around vertical wall 
abutments were amplified up to a factor of 10 depending upon flow conditions and abutment 
protrusion ratios. It was also found that shear stress amplification due to local effects at the 
nose region of a vertical wall is a function of the opening ratio and turning angle. Shear stress 
amplification due to channel restrictions is a function of opening ratio, approach Froude 
number, and protrusion length. Both formulas for estimating shear stress amplification due to 
local effects at the nose region of vertical wall abutments and for estimating shear stress 
amplification due to channel restriction are proposed. The sum of the two shear stress 
amplifications equals the total nose shear stress amplification.  
 
Ahmed and Rajaratnam (2000) investigated the flow around a 450 wing-wall bridge 
abutment. It was found that the approach flow turns into a complex 3D skewed flow in the 
upstream and surrounding regions of the abutment. The bed shear stress was found to 
increase substantially near the abutment, reaching a peak value of 
63
.3
0 ≈
τ
τ
 at the 
 
2-3
abutment nose, with τ  and 
0
τ  being the shear stress and the approach shear stress at the bed, 
respectively. They also found that the skewing of the flow around the bridge abutment is 
greater than flow around bridge piers.  
 
2.3 Parameters Influencing Local Scour at Abutments 
 
 
The parameters affecting the local scour at abutments are listed in Table 2-1. Using 
these variables, the scour depth at the abutment may be represented functionally as:

in which f represents ‘a function of ’. Some of these variables can be neglected under 
certain circumstances. By doing so and non-dimensionalizing the remaining, the following 
variables are believed to be most important in influencing the scour at abutments: time t, 
velocity

Knowledge of how these variables affect the abutment scour is required in designing scour 
countermeasures. Discussion of these variables is followed next.  
 
2.3.1 
Time Evolution 
 
In local scour studies, maximum scour depth is very important because only by 
knowing the maximum scour depth are engineers able to know how much the bridge 
foundations need to be protected from scour.  Therefore, to know the temporal evolution of 
the scour and the time needed for the scour to reach the equilibrium state is very helpful in 
obtaining the maximum scour depth. Also, by obtaining the temporal evolution of scour 
process, shorter scour experiments can be run without failing to obtain the maximum scour 
depth and time and funds can be saved. Also scour depth at a certain moment of a flood 
hydrograph could be predicted with the help of the scour time evolution curve.  
 
 
2-4
It is established that the local scour depth increases progressively with time and 
reaches equilibrium. Three phases have been identified by various researchers including Gill 
(1972), Wong (1982), Tey (1984), Kwan (1984), Ettema (1980), Kandasamy (1985) and 
Dongol (1994) as the initial, the principal, and the equilibrium phases, which can be shown 
by the different slopes on the plots of the scour depth against the logarithm of time.   
 
A number of approaches concerning the quantitative description of the time evolution 
of scour depth around abutments, spur dikes and cylindrical piers exist at present. Most of 
them apply to the principal phase and consist of formulas that include one or more 
coefficients established experimentally. Among those formulas are Ahmad (1953), Liu 
(1961), Cunha (1975), Laursen (1963), Ettema (1980), Franzetti et al. (1982), Whitehouse 
(1997) and Oliveto and Hager (2002). Cunha (1975) concluded that the time to reach the 
equilibrium scour depth under clear-water conditions is much longer than under live-bed 
conditions.

2.3.2 The Effect of Flow Velocity 
 
It is well known that when the shear stress the flow exerts on the particles is greater 
than the critical shear stress that the particles can resist, the particles begin to move and scour 
starts. For a fully developed turbulent flow like the downflow that causes the scour at the 
abutment corner and that occurs in natural channels, the total shear stress of the flow can be 
expressed as (Dongol 1994):

tτ  = turbulent shear stress;

ντ
 viscous shear stress; τ  = total shear stress; 
dy
du
 = vertical gradient of velocity; 
∗u = 
shear velocity. 
 
It can be seen from the equation above that the shear stress of the flow, the shear 
velocity and the velocity gradient of the flow are related to each other. Generally, the shear 
velocity ratio 
c
u
u
∗
∗
is a good measure of the strength of the downflow and therefore the 
scouring potential of the vortex structures at abutments. It is often used in the relations of 
scour prediction equations. But because of the difficulties of measuring the shear velocity 
under live-bed conditions, the velocity ratio 
c
U
U
has been used in preference to the shear 
velocity ratio as a measure of the flow intensity.   
      
From data of Dongol (1994) it was found that the scour depth increases almost 
linearly with flow velocity or shear velocity until the flow velocity reaches the threshold 
condition. After that, for live-bed conditions, the scour depth varies depending on the bed 
regime on the approach flow bed. For pier studies with non-rippling sediment (
7.0
50 ≥
d
mm), 
the equilibrium scour depth at first decreases with flow velocity beyond the threshold 
condition and then reaches a minimum value. Thereafter the scour increases again towards a 
second maximum with further increase of the flow velocity. Fluctuations of scour depth 
occur due to an imbalance of the sediment transport into and out of the scour hole. The scour 
 
2-7
depth at the second maximum is less than that at the threshold condition. But for rippling 
sediment (
7.0
50 ≤
d
mm), the scour depth at the threshold condition is less than that at the 
second maximum because of the ripple formation at velocities below the threshold that 
causes a steady supply of sediment into the scour hole, which induces less scour. Chiew 
(1984) indicated this trend for rippling and non-rippling sediment scour using his pier scour 
data and he also suggested that scour depths reduce for very high velocities beyond the 
transition flat bed condition where velocities are supercritical.  
 
Experiments conducted at bridge abutments showed that the influence of flow 
velocity is very similar to that for piers according to Gill (1972), Kandasamy (1989) and 
Dongol (1994). All data indicated an increasing trend in the relationship between scour depth 
and flow velocity.  
 
Data of Dongol showed the relationship between scour depths with respect to velocity 
ratio using many different abutment models at different flow depths with different sediment 
sizes over a wide velocity range. He concluded that the maximum scour depth is observed at 
the threshold condition and decreases thereafter with further increase in the velocity, reaching 
minimum at higher velocities. Then after that, the scour depth increases again attaining, at the 
transition flat bed condition, a value equivalent to that at the threshold condition. Thereafter 
the scour depth decreases with further increase in the velocity with the formation of anti-
dunes.  
 
Melville and Sutherland (1988) proposed a flow intensity factor 
I
K  to account for the 
effect of velocity on the abutment scour. Based on a series of pier and abutment scour data 
available, Melville (1997) has been able to define the flow intensity factor as:

include the sediment gradation effects as well.  
 
2.3.3 The Effect of Flow Depth 
 
Pier scour researchers found that for constant shear velocity ratio, 
c
u
u
∗
∗/
, the relative 
scour depth, 
D
ds /
, where D is the diameter of the cylindrical pier, increases at a decreasing 
rate with increasing normalized flow depth, 
D
Y /
0
, towards a limiting value beyond which 
the effect of 
D
Y /
0
is negligible. Ettema (1980) showed also that the limiting value of the 
D
Y /
0
ratio for scour depth at piers depends upon sediment size as well. Abutment scour data 
by Wong (1982), Tey (1984), Kwan (1988), Kandasamy (1989), and Dongol (1994) also 
showed a similar trend, i.e., the scour depth at abutment increases with flow depth at a 
decreasing rate towards a limiting value beyond which there is no effect of flow depth. The 
limiting value of the ratio was found to be about 3 ~ 4. Data from Gill (1972) and Dongol 
(1994) showed that this limiting value increases as the sediment size decreases. This trend 
was observed both at clear-water conditions and live-bed scour conditions.  
 
Melville (1992) recommended a flow depth factor 
y
K  to account for the effects of 
flow depth on scour. This factor will be discussed later with the abutment length factor
L
K .  
 
2.3.4 The Effect of Sediment Size  
 
It is important to distinguish between clear-water and live-bed scour when 
considering the effects of sediment size on scour. Under live-bed conditions, some early pier 
scour researchers argued that there is no significant effect of sediment size on local scour, but 
some others suggested that the scour depth decreases with an increase in the sediment size. 
For clear-water conditions, most studies have shown that sediment size has an effect on local 
scour.  
 
 
2-9
The scour studies for piers by various researchers show that under clear-water 
conditions the scour depth increases with an increase in sediment size for finer sediments, 
while the reverse trend is true for coarser sediments. Dongol (1994) divided the sediment size 
relative to the abutment length into four groups on the basis of scour development for 
different values of 
50
/ d
L
 at the principal stage as follows: (1)
100

 Ettema (1980) data for pier scour, together with abutment data obtained by Gill 
(1970), Wong (1982), Kwan (1987) and Kandasamy and Dongol are plotted by Kandasamy 
(1989). All data apply to threshold conditions and non-rippling sediments with 
3.1
<
g
σ
. The 
curves showed that the scour depth increases rapidly with sediment size to a peak at 
50
/
50 >
d
L
, for a constant pier diameter or abutment length, and then decreases. It needs to 
be noted that data by Gill and Wong were measured before equilibrium had been reached so 
that the scour depth may be smaller than otherwise it should be. But Dongol (1994) found 
that the relative equilibrium scour depth, 
L
ds /
decreases as 
50
/ d
L
 decreases below 40. For 
large values of 
50
/ d
L
, the effect of sediment size is insignificant.  
 
Melville and Sutherland (1988) proposed a sediment size factor 
d
K to account for the effect 
of sediment size on abutment scour and defined it as:

2.3.5 The Effect of Sediment Gradation 
 
River bed materials are generally nonuniform. A measure of the nonuniformity of the 
sediment is geometrical standard deviation
g
σ . For the log-normally distributed sediment, 
g
σ is given by 
 
2-10
 
 
                            (2-6) 
 
The effect of sediment gradation on scour depth depends upon whether the scour 
occurs under clear-water or live-bed conditions. For sediment with the same 
50
d  and under 
similar flow conditions, it is found that less scour is developed in nonuniform sediments than 
in uniform sediments. Scour depth is seen to decrease progressively with increasing 
g
σ  
(Ettema (1980), Wong (1982), Melville (1992) and Dongol (1994)).  
 
Data by Ettema (1976) showing the effect of sediment gradation on scour depth at 
piers at the critical condition are plotted by Dongol (1994) together with data by Wong 
(1982) for wing-wall abutment. The diagram is plotted using 
σ
K  versus sediment 
gradation,

where L(D) represents the abutment length L if it’s abutment and the pier diameter D 
if it’s a pier that is considered. 
 
From that plot it was found that except for rippling sediment, the scour depths for 
both pier and abutment scour have peak values with 
1
=
g
σ
and decrease with increasing 
g
σ . 
It is attributed to the armoring effects due to the formation of armour layers in the scour holes 
that protect the underlying finer fractions from erosion and inhibit the scour development.  
For the rippling sediment at 
1
=
g
σ
, due to formation of ripples and continuous transport of 
the sediments into the scour hole, a lesser scour depth is observed. At slightly high values of 
5.1
=
g
σ
, a weak armour layer forms stabilizing the bed and inhibiting ripple formation. As a 
consequence, the scour depth reaches its peak. With even greater values of 
7.1

, the 
armoring becomes a prominent feature and a consequent reduction of scour depth is

observed. At still higher values of 
2
>
g
σ
, rippling sediment behaves like nonrippling 
sediment.  
 
The effect of sediment gradation on scour depth in live-bed conditions is more complex, due 
to the different mobility associated with the sediment (Bake, 1986).  
 
Dongol (1994) studied the effects of sediment gradation on scour depth for different 
flow depths. It was found that there is an increase in the armour peak velocity, 
a
U  and a 
decrease in the relative scour depth, 
L
ds /
, with increasing
g
σ . This is due to an increase in 
coarseness of the armor layer with
g
σ , which protects the underlying sediment and inhibits 
the further development of scour for a wide range of flow conditions. Also the armoring on 
the bed inhibits erosion of the sediment, therefore restraining dune formation and reducing 
dune height. It is also seen that the effect of sediment gradation on scour depth is more 
prominent at lower flow velocities.  
 
2.3.6 The Effect of Abutment Length 
 
Abutment length is one of the most important parameters influencing the scour 
process and depth at an abutment. Various experimental data have shown that the scour depth

Field (1971), Gill (1970), Zaghloul and McCorquodale (1975), Zaghloul (1983), and 
Rajaratnam and Nwachukwu (1983). Some other researchers, including Laursen (1962), 
Cunha (1975), Kwan (1984), Kandasamy (1989), Melville (1992), and Dongol (1994, have 
preferred using the 
0

ratio to represent the abutment length.

Kandasamy (1989) studied the scour at abutments under clear-water conditions 
comprehensively and based on his experimental data he presented a three dimensional 
graphical relationship to explain the interaction of abutment length, flow depth and scour 
depth, defining the functional relationship as

 into four different zones. 
 
Zone 1: In this zone, which he called the scour situation as “scour at short 
abutments”, he found that the scour depth is independent of flow depth. The scour depth 
increases with the increasing abutment length rapidly and almost linearly. A dead water zone 
ahead of the abutment is virtually nonexistent.  
 
Zone 2 and 3: In these two zones, according to Kandasamy, scour occurs at medium 
and intermediate length abutments.  The rate of scour depth increase with abutment or flow 
depth is less than that at a short abutment. A dead water zone develops as a consequence of 
the greater deflection of flow around the relatively longer abutment.  
     
Zone 4: at very large values of
0
/ y
L
, the ratio reaches the limiting condition and 
maximum scour depth is observed. The scour situation is termed as “scour at a long 
abutment”.  
 
Melville (1992) plotted abutment scour data by Gill (1972), Wong (1982), Tey 
(1984), Kwan (1984, 1988), Kandasamy (1989) and Dongol (1990) as

and drew envelope curves to these data. Then he proposed a scour equation

Dongol (1994) studied the effect of abutment length on scour. His data was plotted 
together with data by Kandasamy (1989) and Tey (1984) for wing wall abutments and Kwan 
(1984) for semi-circular end abutments. From his plot, it was found that when 
60

≥
y
L
 the 
rate of increase of scour depth with abutment length is insignificant. And for 
100
/
≥
y
L
, 
scour depth virtually remains constant.  
 
Further data were plotted by Melville (1997) from scour data at wing-wall, vertical 
wall, and spill-through (with H:V slopes of 0.5:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, respectively) abutments, 
augmented by data from Dongol (1994) as 
y

y

 and 
L

. These 
data were obtained under different flow intensity values of 
c

and with uniform sediment. 
These data verified Melville’s (1992) abutment scour formulation. 
 
2.3.7 The Effect of Abutment Shape 
 
The local scour magnitude at abutments differs depending on the shape of the 
abutment. The strength of downflow and secondary flow that is responsible for the scour can 
be greatly reduced at streamlined abutments than at blunt shaped abutments. Therefore, the 
scour at streamlined abutments is less than that at the blunt shaped abutments. The effect of 
abutment shape on the local scour at abutments has long been of interest to researchers.  
 
Inglis’ (1949) studies of spur dikes showed that the scour depth at a spur dike varied 
with the sharpness of curvature of the spur. Liu et al. (1961) found that the scour at a wing 
wall abutment is twice that at a spill-through abutment. Laursen and Toch (1956) found that 
the shape of the abutment affects the scour depth with a 15% reduction for streamlined 
abutments. Rajaratnam and Nwachukwu (1983) observed the shear stress to be 14% higher at 
a plate groyne compared to a circular groyne. Data from Dongol (1994) showed the 
maximum scour happened at the vertical wall abutment, and the smallest scour occurred at 
the most gentle sloped spill-through abutment.  
 
 
2-14
To account for different shapes of abutment, Field (1971), Melville (1992) and some 
other researchers have proposed different coefficients and relationships for design purposes. 
The effect of shape is expressed using the shape factor 
s
K by Melville and the values of the 
shape factors are given in Table 2-2. The vertical wall abutment is used as a reference. For 
the spill-through abutment, the abutment length was taken as the length at mid-depth in the 
water. The shape factors given in Table 2-2 were derived by a procedure to produce the best 
collapse of data over a range of experimental conditions. These data included Gill (1972), 
Wong (1982), Tey (1984), Kwan (1984, 1988), Kandasamy (1989) and Dongol (1990) and 
were all obtained at the threshold condition with uniform sediments.

The effects of abutment shape are included by applying the shape factor given in 
Table 2-2. It is postulated that the importance of abutment shape should diminish as the 
abutment including the bridge approach embankment becomes longer, because the effect of 
shape is wrought only at the end of the abutment. An adjusted shape factor was 
recommended by Melville (1992) for different values of

2.3.8 The Effect of Abutment Skewness 
 
Ideally, bridges are constructed at a straight reach of the river channel and normal to 
the flow, giving the shortest span and eliminating skewness. However, skewness is likely, 
due to the existing road layout constraints and river channel geometry. Abutment skewness is 
defined as the inclination of the abutment to the mean flow direction and is denoted by θ  as 
indicated in figure 2-2. 
 
 
Figure 2-2: Abutment skewness angle definition.  
 
 The effect of abutment skewness on abutment scour has been studied by various 
researchers, among which are Ahmad (1953), Laursen (1958), Sastry (1962), Field (1971), 
Zaghloul (1983), Kwan (1984) and Kandasamy (1985). The results of these studies  in terms 
of the alignment factor 
θk , defined as the ratio of the scour depth at a skewness other than 
90o to that at 90o , apply to both live-bed and clear-water conditions and show that the scour 
depth increase with an increase in θ  for 
o
90

θ
. For 
o
90
>
θ
, data by Kwan and Kandasamy

show that the scour depth decreases with increasing skewness while data by other researchers 
show contradictory results. Dongol (1994) argued that the short running time of their 
experiments compared to Kwan and Kandasamy’s casts doubt on the equilibrium scour 
depths. For design purpose, Melville (1992) proposed an abutment alignment factor 
θ
K and 
recommended an envelope curve drawn to these data. The effect of abutment alignment 
depends on the abutment length. It is postulated that the importance of skewness should 
diminish as the abutment becomes shorter. Melville recommended using an adjusted 
alignment

2.3.9 The Effect of Approach Channel Geometry 
 
The approach channel geometry can have a very significant influence on the local 
scour depth at bridge abutments, particularly for long abutments. Bridge abutments can be set 
back from the natural stream bank or can project out into the flow, and there can be varying 
amounts of over-bank flow that are intercepted by the approaches to the bridge and returned 
to the stream at the abutment. The scour at an abutment can be caused by the abutment 
projecting into the flow, by the bridge approaches intercepting overland flow and forcing it 
back into the channel at the abutments, or a combination of conditions, as discussed by 
Richardson et al. (Melville, 1992).  
 
Melville (1995) has classified abutment scour as three basic cases. Case I applies to a 
bridge spanning a well-defined river channel with no floodplain. In Case II, the bridge 
approach spans the floodplain and protrudes into the main channel of a compound river 
channel, the abutment being sited in the main channel. In Case III, the bridge approach and 
 
2-17
abutment only span part of the floodplain. Case III can be further divided into two types. The 
first type is the case that the abutment is set back from the main channel bank; the second 
type is the case that the abutment terminates right on the edge of the main channel bank.  
 
Melville (1992) proposed a factor 
G
K to include the approach channel geometrical 
effects. The 
G
K  factor will depend on the relative size, shape, and roughness of the main 
channel and the floodplain channel, and on the abutment length in relation to the floodplain 
width.  
 
Dongol (1994) studied the effect of cross-sectional shape of the approach channel on 
the scour depth at a wing wall abutment of fixed length under clear-water conditions in an 
idealized compound channel. Uniform sediment is used and the abutment is oriented 
perpendicular to the flow direction. His data are plotted as 
G

values, that is, relative shallow flood channels, 
G

. It was also found that the equation derived slightly 
overpredicts the experimental data in general.  
 
By assuming equal slope only, equation (2-12) was plotted by Melville (1995). The

G

It was shown that the effect of slightly higher roughness in the floodplain compared to that in 
the main channel is a reduction in 
G
K  and hence in scour depth, especially at small values of 
f

, that is, for the case of an abutment sited at about the 
edge of a relatively shallow and rough floodplain, the scour depth can be as small as 10 
percent of that in the corresponding rectangular channel. The 
G
K values predicted using this 
equation should be confirmed by experiment.

Based on all the scour factors that are discussed above, the following relation has

2.4 Experimental Studies of Scour at Abutment in Compound Channels 
 
Sturm and Janjua (1993) performed an experimental study in a wide flume with a 
defined main channel adjoining a floodplain with movable bed. A proposed relationship for 
the abutment scour depth is suggested from dimensional analysis, and it is shown from a 
regression analysis that the scour data are well represented by the approach Froude number 
and the discharge contraction ratio in the proposed relationship. These results do not apply to 
an abutment encroaching onto the banks of the main channel. 
 
Sturm and Janjua (1994) studied clear-water scour around a bridge abutment in a 
wide floodplain of a compound channel. First through dimensional analysis and contraction 
theory derivation, they came up with a preliminary relationship of the form

discharge in the approach section with a width equal to the opening width and the total 
approach discharge. Then experiments were conducted in a flume with a fixed-bed main 
channel and a movable-bed floodplain in which the abutment terminated. Flow depth, 
discharge, compound-channel geometry, and abutment length were varied, and measurements 
of approach velocity distribution and scour depth were obtained. They found that the 
experimental data of dimensional scour depth displayed a considerable collapse when plotted 
against

gave the best-fit linear equation of their data as:

They argued that the discharge ratio M reflects the influence of the compound-
channel geometry and roughness on the flow field, and ultimately on the scour hole depth. 
The proposed relationship is limited to the range of values covered by the variables in this 
study. 
 
Sturm and Sadiq (1996) conducted an experimental study of the depth of clear-water 
scour around the end of a square-edged bridge abutment terminating in the floodplain of a 
compound channel. It is indicated that a discharge contraction ratio arising from a theoretical 
contraction scour analysis for equilibrium conditions can be used for explaining the effect of 
flow distribution on the local abutment scour depth in the case where significant backwater 
occurs from bridge contraction. The use of reference values of approach flow depth and 
velocity in the floodplain for undisturbed conditions without the bridge is shown to collapse 
experimental results for scour depth in both the case of a contraction with negligible 
backwater and the case of a contraction with significant backwater in the bridge approach 
section. 
 
Sturm and Chrisochoides (1997) investigated experimentally clear-water scour around 
a bridge abutment for variable embankment lengths in a compound channel with the setback 
of the abutment face relative to the edge of the main channel varying from 0.17 to 0.66 for 
three different sediment sizes and two different channel cross-sections. They found that both 
measured and numerically predicted velocities 
a
U in the local scour region near the face of 
the upstream end of the abutment at initiation of scour explain, at least in part, the measured 
values of equilibrium scour depth.

Sturm and Chrisochoides (1998a) investigated experimentally clear-water scour 
around a bridge abutment for variable embankment lengths in a compound channel with the 
setback of the abutment face relative to the edge of the main channel varying from zero to a 
large value. Vertical-wall and spill-through abutments with three different sediment sizes 
were investigated. They found that the scour data can be represented in terms of the 
dimensionless ratio of

limitation of their work may be that since their flume bed slope was fixed to 0.0022, for 
different discharges the scour data may be not comparable since they resulted from different 
shear stress ratios.  
 
Sturm (1998) presented two different formulations for clear-water scour prediction for 
flow around bridge abutments on the floodplain of a compound channel. The first 
formulation is of the form of

variables in the approach section to the bridge with emphasis on parameterizing the 
redistribution of flow between the main channel and floodplain due to the flow contraction 
caused by the bridge opening. The second formulation is of the form of

hydraulic variables near the face of the abutment. The first formulation requires a one-
dimensional numerical flow model to compute the scour prediction variables while the 
second formulation needs a two-dimensional numerical model to compute the required flow 
variables. Both formulations are tested with a series of experimental data collected in 
laboratory compound channels having three different geometries and three different sediment 
sizes and a similar degree of correlation for each of the formulations is shown by regression 
analysis.  
 
Cardoso and Bettess (1999) conducted experiments in a compound channel using 
abutments that extended different distances onto the floodplain including right up to the edge 
of the main channel (Melville, Type III) to study the effect of time and channel geometry on 
scour at those abutments. The experiments were performed with flow on the floodplain being 
critical. They found that for clear-water scour the equilibrium was reached after 68 hours on 
average, and for live-bed conditions equilibrium was attained after 10 hours on average. The 
three phases were identified in the time development of the scour. Moreover, the scour 
development in the principal phase is well described by the theories of Ettema (1980), 
Franzetti (1982), and Whitehouse (1997). However, time needed for clear-water scour to 
reach the equilibrium state seems to vary with sediment size. Sturm and Janjua (1993) found 
that for sediment size of 3.3 mm it only took 12~16 hours to reach a state when there was no 
further movement of sediment out of the scour hole, which implies the equilibrium state is 
reached.  
 
Cardoso and Bettess (1999) found in their experiments that unless the abutment 
approached to the edge of the main channel, there was little interaction between the flow in 
the main channel and flow on the floodplain. They also found that as the ratio of the 
abutment length to the floodplain width L/Lf tends from smaller than 1 to 1, increase of scour 
depth was not found at the tip of the abutment; on the contrary, their data indicate a flattening 
 
2-23
or decreasing trend for L/Lf >0.8. These findings contradict with Kouchakzadeh and 
Townsend (1997).  
 
In Kouchakzadeh and Townsend (1997), they found that at small floodplain depths, 
the difference between main channel and floodplain velocities initiates a strong lateral 
momentum transfer in the form of banks of vortices having their vertical axes along the main 
channel and floodplain junction regions even without the presence of the abutment. They 
found that as the L/Lf ratio increases from 0.24 to 0.55, both the shear stresses and the scour 
depth increase at the tip of the abutment for both interacting flow and non-interacting flow 
(the flow on the floodplain being isolated from the flow in the main channel by a plate placed 
on the edge of floodplain along the flow direction). For the case of abutments terminating 
near a river’s main channel and floodplain junction regions, under the condition of strong 
flow interaction, the lateral momentum transfer can produce a 15-30% increase in local scour 
at the abutments. Therefore, the conclusion was drawn that scour can be reduced by isolating 
the main channel flow from the floodplain flow.  
 
These vortices act as mechanisms for transferring momentum between the main 
channel and floodplain zones by their continuous emergence and decay (Sellin, 1964). Myers 
and Elsawy’s (1975) study quantified the impact of LMT on both the value and distribution 
of boundary shear stress in the main channel and floodplain of their asymmetric compound-
shaped channel. For their shallowest floodplain depth, they observed 260 and 200 percent 
increases in maximum and average floodplain shear stresses, respectively, under conditions 
of interacting flows over isolated flows.

CHAPTER 3. A LITERATURE REVIEW ON BRIDGE ABUTMENT SCOUR 
COUNTERMEASURES 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
A wide variety of countermeasures have been used to control channel instability and 
scour at bridge foundations. In HEC-23 (Lagasse et al., 1997) a countermeasure matrix is 
organized to highlight the various groups of countermeasures and to identify their individual 
characteristics. Countermeasures have been organized into groups based on their 
functionality with respect to scour and stream instability. The three main groups of 
countermeasures 
are: 
hydraulic 
countermeasures, 
structural 
countermeasures, 
and 
monitoring.  Hydraulic countermeasures can be further classified as river training structures 
and armoring countermeasures. 
 
Countermeasures for local scour at abutments consist of countermeasures that 
improve flow orientation at the bridge end and move local scour away from the abutment, as 
well as revetments and riprap placed on spill slopes to resist erosion.  
 
Selected countermeasures including spur dikes, guide banks and collars will be 
reviewed and studied subsequently.  
 
3.2 Spurs dikes 
 
3.2.1 
Introduction  
 
Spur dikes have been studied intensively for many years mostly as river training or 
river rehabilitation structures instead of abutment scour countermeasures. Studies on spur 
dikes include Lacey (1936), Inglis (1949), Mushtaq Ahmad (1953), Laursen (1953, 1962b), 
Andru and Blench (1957), Iwagaki (1958), Garde (1961), Liu et al. (1961), Cunha (1973), 
Gill (1972), Garde (1961), Franco (1982), Copeland (1983), Rajaratnam and Nwachukwu 
(1983a), Zaghloul (1983), Brown (1985), Suzuki et al. (1987), Khan and Chaudry (1992), 
Wu and Lim 1993), Molis et al. (1995), Mayerle et al. (1995), Muneta and Shimizu (1994), 
Tominaga et al. (1997), Zhang and Du (1997), Soliman et al. (1997), Farsirotou et al. (1995),

 Kuhnle et al. (1997, 1998, and 1999), Shields et al. (1991, 1995, 1998), Lagasse et al. 
(2001). Spur dike length, alignment with flow, flow structure around spur dikes, construction 
materials and many other parameters have been investigated. Scour depth predictors around 
spur dikes and spur dike design guide lines are provided.  
 
Spur dikes have been used extensively in all parts of the world as river training 
structures to enhance navigation, improve flood control, and protect erodible banks 
(Copeland, 1983).  Spur dikes are structures that project from the bank into the channel. 
There are a variety of terms that refer to these transverse structures, including spur dikes, 
transverse dikes, cross dikes, spurs, wing dams, jetties, groins, deflectors.  While there are 
some differences in the use of these terms they may be taken to be generally synonymous.  
Following usage of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Franco, 1982; Copeland, 1983), spur 
dikes will be used here.  Spur dikes may be permeable, allowing limited passage of water at a 
reduced velocity, or they may function to completely block the current (impermeable).  They 
may be constructed out of a variety of materials including masonry, concrete, earth and stone, 
steel, timber sheet piling, gabions, timber fencing, or weighted brushwood fascines.  They 
may be designed to be submerged regularly by the flow or to be submerged only by the 
largest flow events.  
 
A spur dike serves one or more of the following functions: (1) Training of the stream 
flow; (2) Protection of the stream bank from erosion; (3) Improvement of depth for 
navigation (Garde, 1961). In recent years, porous and overflow-type spur dikes have been 
shown to have ecological effects providing appropriate habitat for fish and other aquatic life 
in highly degraded streams.  Because of the deposition induced by spur dikes, they may 
protect a stream bank more effectively and at less cost than revetments (Lagasse et al., 2001).  
Spur dikes are usually built in a group of two or more, and may be at right angles to the bank, 
angled upstream, or angled downstream.  The crest of the individual dikes might be level or 
sloping from the bank towards the channel.  The crest of each succeeding dike in a system 
might be at the same, at a higher, or at a lower elevation than the one upstream, based on the 
low-water plane (Franco, 1982).  Even with the widespread use of spur dikes, there has been 
no definitive hydraulic design criteria developed.  Design guidance is based largely on 
3
3- 
 experience and practices within specific geographical areas.  This is due to the wide range of 
variables affecting the performance of the spur dikes and the differing importance of these 
variables with specific applications.  The main site-specific parameters affecting the 
performance of the spur dikes include: channel width, depth, flow velocity, shape of flow 
hydrographs, sinuosity of the channel, bed material size distribution and transport rate, 
material characteristics of the bank (Copeland, 1983).  Parameters that affect the performance 
of spur dikes include length, width, height, shape, orientation angle, permeability, 
construction materials, and longitudinal extent of the spur dike field (Melville and Coleman, 
2000).   
 
Spur dikes may be classified based on their permeability: high permeability - retarder 
spur dikes; impermeable - deflector spur dykes; and intermediate permeability - as 
retarder/deflector (Brown, 1985).  Permeability of a spur dike may be defined as the 
percentage of the spur dike surface facing the flow that is open.  A permeable spur dike of the 
hurdle or pile cluster type has the advantage of slowing down the current instead of 
deflecting it, thus hastening the deposition of sediment and building up of the high ground 
and the bank lines. This is especially effective on rivers carrying a considerable amount of 
suspended sediment. Permeable spur dikes have been used in India and Pakistan as a 
temporary measure to meet exigencies with success. But permeable spur dikes have their 
draw-backs. Because (1) they are not as strong as the solid types in resisting the forces 
exerted by floating debris or ice; (2) they are a nuisance to navigation during high water 
period if built low, and the cost of long piles may be prohibitive if built high; (3) the best type 
of permeable construction is obtained by using piles, but this would not be feasible where the 
river bed is of gravel and boulders; they will not resist the flow very well unless they be of 
the tetrahedral type such as those used in California and Japan, where slant posts connected 
to base beams are weighted down by concrete blocks or stones in wire crates (The United 
Nations 1953). 
   
A qualitative guide as to the type of spur dike to use for a specific situation is given in 
a table in Lagasse et al.(2001). This table provides preliminary advice on the type of spur 
dike that may be most suitable for a given circumstance.

3.2.2 
Local Scour at Spur Dikes 
 
The local scour pattern at spur dikes is quite similar to the scour pattern at bridge 
abutments since they are essentially similar structures and have similar configurations in 
rivers.  The flow adjacent to a spur dike is characterized by a system of vortices that is 
formed as the flow is diverted around the structure. Flow velocity is greatest at the edge of 
the structure where the protrusion into the channel is greatest. This flow velocity peak and 
high turbulence causes bed material to be suspended intermittently and transported by the 
flow. For simple-shaped spur dikes (i.e. flat plates without overtopping flow), the maximum 
depth of scour occurs at the tip of the structure. For more complicated spur dike shapes and 
overtopping flows the shape of the scour hole may become more complex. Predicting the 
vertical and lateral extent of the local scour is critical for determining the length of bank the 
spur dike will protect and for determining the depth of spur dike required to protect its base.   
 
An established procedure for predicting the maximum scour depths associated with 
spur dikes is currently lacking.  The many complicating parameters of the stream and the spur 
dike design are undoubtedly a factor in the lack of a unified prediction relation for prediction 
of scour in the vicinity of spur dikes.  Equations to predict the maximum depth of scour have 
been developed by several researchers.  These equations were derived from experiments in 
laboratory flumes in which the maximum depth of scour associated with spur dikes was 
measured.  Even with modern equipment the maximum scour depth associated with spur 
dikes in the field is very difficult to collect.  Unsteady flows, nonuniform and sometimes 
varying sediment sizes, and the difficulty of determining the actual location of the stream 
bottom, make collection of field data challenging and rare.  
 
Lacey (1936) gives a formula for maximum scour depth at a spur-dike. Based mainly 
on the field observation, Inglis (1949) compared the maximum scour depths with those 
obtained from Lacey’s equation. He recommended certain coefficients to be applied to 
Lacey’s regime depth to find the maximum scour depth and also analyzed the influence of 
size of material on the maximum scour depth. Based upon experiments with bed material 
5
3- 
 ranging in size from 0.06 mm to 0.37 mm, Inglis concluded that gradation is a factor 
affecting the maximum scour. His study also indicated that the maximum scour depth 
depends on local discharge (on the local mean velocity of flow).  
 
Ahmad (1953) conducted investigations on the behavior of spur dikes using sand of 
0.37 mm and 0.7 mm mean diameter and drew some valuable conclusions regarding the 
effect of various parameters on the maximum scour. He studied the effect of different 
discharge intensity, sand grade, flow concentration and angle of the spur dike to flow on the 
scour depth and scour pattern around a spur dike. He gave a formula for calculating the scour 
depth at a spur dike nose for different conditions of flow concentration and angles of 
approach based on the experiments. He also determined the shape of the falling apron in 
plans for different types of spur dikes and for various angles of approach to a T-headed spur. 
He was of the opinion that the maximum scour depth is unaffected by change in the sediment 
grade. But the rate of the development of the scour is much more rapid with finer sand. 
 
Laursen (1953) has stated that scour around bridge piers is a function of depth of flow 
and is independent of mean velocity and size of bed material for a given opening ratio. 
Laursen (1962b) maintained that under conditions of no sediment supply, such as a relief 
bridge, the velocity and the sediment size are important in determining the depth of scour and 
that under conditions of sediment supply by the approach flow well above the critical tractive 
force, the velocity and sediment size have little effect except insofar as they determine the 
mode of sediment movement.  
 
Andru and Blench (1957), after analyzing various laboratory and field data on the 
scour at obstructions, concluded that the depth of local scour depends on discharge intensity 
and the size of bed material. Izzard and Bradley (1957) feel that the sediment size and 
gradation affects only the rate of development of scour hole and not the maximum scour hole. 
 
Also according to Iwagaki (1958), the size of the material is important in the study of 
scour, and the drag coefficient CD is a significant parameter that takes into consideration the 
size and the specific weight of the sediment. 
6
3- 
 
 
Garde (1961) conducted experiments with four sizes of spurs which gave the 
contraction ratio of 0.90, 0.835, 0.667, and 0.530 in a channel of 0.61-m width. They used 
four sizes of sand, namely, 0.3 mm, 0.46 mm, 1 mm, and 2.3 mm in diameter. According to 
Garde, Froude number is a significant parameter for scour around obstructions and also the 
size of sediment has an influence both on the rate of scour and the maximum scour depth.  
 
Liu et al. (1961) did experiments in two flumes with sediment sizes of 0.56 mm and 
0.65 mm, respectively, and found that (1) the effect of flow velocity on scour is appreciable; 
(2) when the flow carries appreciable bed load, the opening ratio has no appreciable effect on 
the depth of scour. But when the flow carries no bed load, the limiting maximum scour is 
found to be a function of the opening ratio; (3) the scour caused by flow carrying bed load is 
a local phenomenon, while the scour caused by flow carrying no bed load is related to the 
overall geometry of the constriction.  Liu did not consider the effect of sediment size on 
scour in this study.  
 
Liu et al. (1961) and Cunha (1973) also determined that the contraction ratio was not 
important once sediment movement was established. However, Liu et al. considered velocity 
to be an important parameter with or without sediment movement. 
 
Tison (1962) did experiments in a 70 cm wide, 20 m long flume with a mean sand 
size of 0.45 mm. He disagrees with Garde (1961). Garde found that with other conditions 
remaining the same, the maximum scour depth has the greatest magnitude for the spur dike 
inclination of 900. While Tison shows by experiments and theoretical analysis that the spur 
dike of upstream inclination should have the maximum scour depth.  
 
Gill (1972) conducted experiments using a flume 0.76 m wide, 0.46 m deep and 12.2 
m long and two sizes of sand of 1.5 mm and 0.91 mm. He concluded that depth of 
equilibrium scour is affected both by size of bed material and depth of uniform flow 
upstream of the spur location. And the depth of maximum scour occurs when the sand bed 
upstream of the spur is at the threshold of movement. The combined effect of the bed 
7
3- 
 material and the flow depth was empirically formulated. 
 
Copeland (1983) carried out model tests in a 130- by 50ft sand bed flume with a 
channel top width of 8ft and an average depth of 0.24ft. The stream sinuosity was 1.6 and the 
slope was 0.0012. He suggested that the coarse fraction of the bed material is an important 
factor that affects the scour depth around the spur dike.  
 
Rajaratnam and Nwachukwu (1983a) tried to study the flow structures near spur dikes 
by measuring the flow in a straight tilting rectangular flume, 120 ft long, 3 ft wide and 2.5 ft 
deep with smooth bed and sides. Most of the tests were done with a smooth bed. They found 
that when a groin is placed in a channel, it causes a significant disturbance to the flow for a 
short distance upstream and for a longer distance downstream. The disturbed flow was 
analyzed by splitting it into a deflected flow region and a shear layer. For the deflected flow 
region, the skewed turbulent boundary layer model of Johnston was found to be valid. In the 
shear layer, the velocity distributions for any horizontal plane were found to be similar. They 
also found that the maximum bed shear stress occurred near the groin nose. The shear stress 
amplification 
o
τ
τ
varies with the ratio of the length of groin and the width of channel b/B. 
The
o
τ
τ
 ratio was 5 and 3 for the 6-in. and 3-in. groin respectively.  
 
Zaghloul (1983) conducted experiments in a 36 ft long, 1.5 ft wide and 2 ft deep 
aluminum flume with Plexiglas wall to study the effects of upstream flow conditions, 
sediment characteristics, and spur dikes’ geometry on the maximum scour depth and scour 
pattern around a spur dike. Through dimensional analysis and experimental data verification, 
he found that the maximum scour depth is significantly affected by the opening ratio of the 
channel and the Froude number of the flow. He also came up with a maximum scour depth 
prediction equation which he found is identical in form to the regime equations by Lacey and 
Blench. His experiments were conducted under clear-water conditions but most runs were 
run for only 2.5 hours. 
 
Suzuki et al. (1987) performed experiments to discuss the characteristics of the local 
bed form around a series of spur dikes in an alluvial bed with continuous sediment motion. 
8
3- 
 He used two flumes, one 0.5m wide and the other 0.4m wide and uniform sand with 
diameter of 0.6mm. He found that the bed form around a series of spur dikes which were 
constructed to form a low-water bed changes greatly with the ratio of the distance between 
the neighboring spur dikes L to the dikes length B. He discovered that when the L/B ratio is 
between 4 and 8, the general bed degradation by a series of spur dikes is almost the same as 
that of a long contraction for the same contraction ratio (Gill, 1972). When the L/B ratio is 
smaller than 4, the degradation caused by those spur dikes becomes larger than for a long 
contraction, while it becomes smaller when L/B greater than 8. He also found that the local 
scour around the first spur dike is similar to that of a single spur dike and its depth depends 
on the flow depth H when H/B is smaller than 1.5. This can be expressed by Laursen’s 
equation (1963) fairly well. When H/B is greater than 1.5, the scour depth is supposed to be 
dependent mainly on B and Gill’s equation is more favorable.  
 
Suzuki also found that the scour around the second spur dike is strongly influenced by 
the first spur dike. The scour depth of the dike far downstream from the first dike is smaller 
than that of the first dike when L/B is less than 12. 
  
Tominaga et al. (1997) studied experimentally the flow and turbulent structures 
around spur dikes with various permeability. The experiments were conducted in an 8m long, 
0.3m wide and 0.4m deep tilting flume. Three types of spur dikes were set up. The first is a 
solid type made of wood, the second is a semi-porous type made of the gravel-filled box 
frame and the third is a porous type made of only the box frame. The spur dike model is 
15cm long, 3cm deep and 10cm high in the non-submerged case, 5cm high in the submerged 
case. He found that the processes of momentum exchange are different from each other with 
respect to the permeability of the spur dike. The recovering process of the streamwise 
velocity distribution becomes slow with an increase of the permeability. When the 
permeability is relatively small, the secondary flow is generated and plays an important role 
on the mixing process. In the submerged spur dike, the recirculation zone is limited to a short 
distance but the lateral difference of the streamwise velocity is not reduced for a long reach. 
So the type of the spur dike should be determined considering each characteristic function.  
 
9
3- 
 
Kuhnle et al. (1997, 1998, and 1999) performed a series of experiments in a flume 
with 30 m length, 1.2 m width, and 0.6 m height to investigate the volume of scour holes 
associated with spur dikes. By varying the spur dike orientation angles, overtopping flow 
height, and the contraction ratio, respectively, they found that: (1) the contraction ratio and 
flow depth are positively correlated with the volume of the scour for a given elapsed time 
under steady flow; (2) the geometry of the scour hole has been shown to be affected by the 
value of the overtopping ratio. The larger the overtopping ratio is, the greater is the erosion of 
the bed in the near bank region and the more the region of maximum scour shifts toward the 
channel bank. It also caused a secondary scour zone to form downstream of the spur dike; (3) 
for the three angles of spur dike and two contraction ratios being considered, 135o spur dikes 
had the lowest, 90o spur dikes had an intermediate value, and 45o had the highest bed erosion 
in the vicinity of the channel bank. The volume of the scour hole was greatest for the 135o 
spur dikes. They also presented a simple procedure to predict the area and volume of scour 
around spur dikes.  
 
In addition, a series of studies of the local scour phenomenon around bridge 
abutments were also carried out by various investigators. These studies have been reviewed 
in a previous chapter. 
 
3.2.3 
Empirical Formulas 
 
Some equations for predicting the scour depth at the nose of spur dikes are listed 
below and all of them are empirical equations. These equations were derived from tests in 
laboratory flumes with limited verification by prototype testing. There has been a general 
lack of agreement of the important variables needed to predict maximum scour depth. This 
disagreement has been possibly settled by Melville (1992, 1997) in which the ratio of the 
length of the structure to the flow depth determines the form of the equation.  Melville’s 
(1992) equations were technically derived for bridge abutments, however, in many cases, 
particularly in experimental studies, model bridge abutments are similar to spur dikes since 
they are structures with similar characteristics.

In Equation (3-2), k varies between 0.8 and 1.8. This equation is for spurs projecting 
straight or upstream with sloping head. 
 
Equation (3-3) is derived from dimensional analysis based on a hypothetical 
experiment. Because the terminal velocity of sediment is taken as a factor, the equation 
should be for flow with sediment transport. The coefficient k is determined by experiments 
and for different positions and flow conditions. It has different values ranging from 1.2 to 
2.25. 
 
The author of Equation (3-4) first carried out dimensional analysis and concluded that 
the maximum scour depth is a function of opening ratio, spur inclination angle to the channel, 
Froude number of the flow, and the drag coefficient of the sediment. Then he plotted his data 
12
3- 
 from his experiment and ended up with the expression of the form of the above equation. K 
and n are functions of CD. For the condition of the experiment, which is for 0.29 mm 
sediment, 900 spur dike inclination, and four specific opening ratios, K is determined to vary 
between 5.00~2.75 and n equals 2/3. The author does not state if this is for clear-water scour 
or sediment transporting scour.  
 
Equation (3-5) pertains to vertical-wall and vertical board models caused by flow 
carrying appreciable bed load and for spur normal to bed flow.  
 
The author of Equation (3-6) refers to the work of Andru in which data from various 
sources are plotted as ysFb
1/3 against q. Equation (3-6) is the best fit line for those data. Here k 
varies between 2.0 and 2.75.  
 
Gill started the derivation of Equation (3-7) from an alternative form of Straub’s 
formula, which was obtained from a simple case of long contraction and supposed to be 
suitable for use in the case of local erosion around spur dikes. Since Equation (3-7) has been 
obtained from data having a narrow range, for example, only two sizes of sand were 
considered. It is only an empirical result and only valid for the results of this investigation. 
This equation is for flow without sediment transportation and its validity can be extended 
with more experimental data.  
 
Laursen assumed that a bridge crossing be a long contraction foreshortened to such an 
extreme that it has only a beginning and an end so that solutions for long contraction can be 
modified to describe the scour at bridge piers and abutments with the use of experimentally-
determined coefficients. Equation (3-8) is thus obtained with some qualitative flume test data 
and it is for an encroaching abutment normal to the flow with sediment transport.  L is the 
effective length of the abutment and r should be determined by experiment.         
               
Equation (3-9) is for spurs normal to flow in the Mississippi River with L/y>25.

In Equation (3-10), K is a coefficient depending on the lateral scour hole slope. 
K=0.68, 1.1 and 1.36 for lateral slopes 10o, 25o and 35o, respectively.  
 
Equation (3-11) is for clear-water scour. For live-bed scour condition, the regression

Through the analysis of local scour, Melville (1992) established the relationship 
between

 ) and the multiplication of a serious of K factors. The K factors are 
expressions describing the influence of each parameter including flow intensity, flow depth, 
sediment size, sediment gradation, abutment length, abutment shape and alignment and 
approach channel geometry. Using laboratory data available, the author tried to determine 
each of these K values and finally obtained Equation (3-12). Because of a lack of data, these 
three equations do not include the effects of sediment characteristics, lateral distribution of 
flow, or river geometric features including over bank flow and may lead to conservative 
estimates of scour depth in some instances. However, the design method has the advantage of 
simplicity.  
 
Zhang and Du (1997) did experiments in a flume of 2.4 m wide and 26 m long to 
study the maximum scour depth around spur dike using sand bed of average sand diameter of 
0.66 mm. The median size of the sand is 0.60 mm and the standard deviation of the sand size 
distribution is 1.90. For spur dikes perpendicular to the flow and maximum scour condition, 
they proposed Equation (3-13) using dimensional analysis and regression analysis techniques 
14

 based on their experimental results. In Equation (3-13), 
c
U  is the flow velocity of beginning 
of sediment motion. 
 
Comparison of local scour depths at spur dikes (bridge abutments) computed using 
some of these equations listed above yields a large variation in predicted values. Kheireldin 
(1995) tested most of these predictor equations using experimental data from Liu (1961), Gill 
(1972) and Zaghloul (1974) and he found that there are large discrepancies between the 
different predictors and the measured scour data. Niehus (1996) compared field scour data 
measured by the USGS with predicted data by most of these equations. He found that almost 
all the abutment scour prediction equations substantially overestimated the scour depth.

Semi-analytical and Analytical Formulae  
 
Based on the continuity equation, scour geometry, and a generalized form of the 
power-law formula for flow resistance in an alluvial channel, Lim (1997) proposed a semi-
analytical equation (3-15) for the maximum clear-water scour condition around an abutment 
perpendicular to the flow direction.

Equation (15) is shown to be in close agreement with the formulas of Melville (1992).  
 
Rahman and Muramoto (1998) considered some experimental features and developed 
a simplified model for the maximum scour depth prediction using the continuity relation 
between the inflow and outflow in the restricted flow concentration region of a scour hole. 
They analytically derived several formulae for vertical wall abutments and sloped wall 
abutments. For instance, the equation in the case of vertical wall abutments can be derived as

empirical formula. Moreover, the effect of Fr on ds/y in supercritical flows is uncertain.

Numerical Simulations around Spur Dikes 
 
The most important aspects to be considered in the spur dike design are the layout, 
plan view, shape, length, spacing, crest longitudinal shape, crest elevation, orientation, 
permeability, construction materials and local scour (Alvarez, 1989). The majority of these 
aspects can nowadays be examined with numerical models. Numerical model simulations are 
usually more cost-effective and faster than physical model studies, and have no inherent 
limitation on spatial extent.  
 
Zaghloul et al. (1973) solved the Helmholtz vorticity equation and Poisson type 
equation using constant eddy viscosity. The velocity and vorticity distributions were obtained 
but computed velocities were not compared with any experimental results.  
 
Tingsanchali (1990) used a two-dimensional depth-averaged equation and a 
ε
κ −
model to close the Reynolds’ stresses. The velocities agreed with the experimental data 
when a correction factor for the streamline curvature was applied to the 
ε
κ −
model. 
 
Khan et al. (1992) tried to simulate the flow around spur-dikes by solving the depth-
averaged Navier-Stokes equations using a two-dimensional mathematical model. 
MacCormack’s explicit finite difference scheme was used and the equations were solved first 
by neglecting the effective stresses and then by including the turbulent stresses. In all his 
16
3- 
 three trials, the model didn’t accurately reproduce the recirculation length. The best 
recirculation was obtained when turbulent stresses were considered with 
001
.0
=
t
ν
 with 
free-slip boundary condition. He concluded that properly reproduced recirculation length is 
needed to get an accurate velocity prediction. In addition, he concluded that the constant eddy 
viscosity model does not give good results for flow problems with circulation. Therefore, a 
turbulence model, like a one- or two-equation model is needed which predicts the distribution 
of 
t
ν over the entire flow.  
 
Wu et al. (1993) used multilayer feedforward neural networks to predict the 
maximum scour depth at spur dikes. What they did is to find a collection of the published 
laboratory flume data on local scour at spur dikes. Then they used some of those data to train 
the neural network and let it fully capture the relationship embedded in those data and test the 
model with the remaining data. For both uniform and non-uniform sediments, neural-
network-based models for predicting the maximum local scour depth in clear-water and live-
bed scour conditions were constructed. A composite model that uses the combined data on 
clear-water and live-bed scour was also established. The author concluded that the neural 
network technique can be successfully used in the correlation of laboratory flume data for 
prediction of maximum local scour depth in the clear-water and live-bed scour conditions. He 
also stated that, compared with traditional approaches, this technique is simple and flexible, 
requires no complicated mathematical modeling and makes no assumptions about the 
relationship between the local scour depth and the scour parameters.  
 
Mayerle et al. (1995) used a three-dimensional numerical model. Six eddy viscosity 
turbulence approaches have been implemented to the model with the objective to verify the 
influence on the flow conditions in the vicinity of spur dikes with different boundary 
conditions. They found that definite dependence of the eddy viscosity field exists especially 
on the reattachment lengths behind the dike, and on the velocities and slopes of the free 
surface. But in the vicinity of the spur dike none of the eddy viscosity approaches tested were 
able to capture the flow patterns properly. Among the eddy viscosity approaches tested, the 
one based on the mixing length and the assumption of the local equilibrium for the turbulent 
kinetic-energy-produced wake length were in very good agreement with the measurements 
17
3- 
 and gave reasonable flow patterns. However, it should not be applied indiscriminately since 
the mixing length is based on measurements in straight rectangular channels.  
 
Molls et al. (1995) numerically simulated the flow near a spur-dike by solving the 
depth-averaged equations using both an implicit ADI scheme and the explicit MacCormack 
scheme. Both inviscid and viscous solutions were obtained. A constant eddy viscosity model 
was used to close the effective stresses with the viscosity near the spur obtained from the 
dimensionless, turbulent, eddy viscosity reported by Tingsanchali and Maheswaran. Also an 
assumption of constant eddy viscosity near the spur throughout the entire flow field was 
made. The ADI scheme was solved in conjunction with a packed grid and the velocity field 
and recirculation length closely matched the experimental data and computed results obtained 
by Nawachukwu and Tingsanchali and Maheswaran, respectively. It was demonstrated that, 
provided with a reasonable estimate of the eddy viscosity near the spur, the constant eddy 
viscosity model produces results similar to those obtained with more advanced turbulence 
models. Through a sensitivity analysis, the ADI scheme was found to be insensitive to Chezy 
C but very sensitive to turbulent viscosity.  
 
Interestingly, Molls’ ADI scheme, Tingsanchali and Maheswaran’s (1990) TEACH 
model and the MacCormack scheme underpredict the experimental velocities at a certain 
location downstream of the spur.  
 
Soliman et al. (1997) used a 2-D mathematical model (TRUSOLA) to simulate a Nile 
bend located about 3 km downstream of Naga Hammadi barrage. In this model, the shallow 
water assumption is used to model the flow, and the vertical momentum equation is reduced 
to a hydrostatic pressure relation. The vertical water motion is derived from the horizontal 
flow field using the continuity equation. The program followed the Boussinesq 
approximation. Different lengths and spacing were used to simulate the effect of spur dikes 
on water levels and velocity components. About fifty runs were carried out. The author 
concluded that: (1) spur dikes would cause appreciable increase in the head upstream if it 
constricted more than 6% of the channel width; (2) A pocket of deposited material occurs 
between the spurs for all tests with spacing less than 4L but disappeared for a spacing of 7L. 
18
3- 
 (3) Flow separation occurred at the tip of the first spur for the entire tests. Eddy formation 
only appeared for spur lengths greater than 18% of the channel width. (4) The longitudinal 
velocity U increased with the increase of the spur lengths that caused a decrease in the 
channel width. The transverse velocity V increased in the case of single spur, whereas for 
double and triple spurs no conclusive trend was found.  
 
 
3.2.6 
Design Considerations for Spur Dike Systems 
3.2.6.1 Length and Spacing of Spur Dikes 
 
Spacing and length of spur dikes has been related to the length of bank that is 
protected by each structure.  This varies with local variables such as bank curvature, flow 
velocity, and whether the structures are designed for navigation or bank protection.   
 
Ahmad (1951) found that a single spur can protect lengths between three to five times 
the spur projections. Copeland (1983) concluded that the effective length is a more important 
factor than the spur dike angle in providing bank protection. He also suggested that the 
spacing-length ratio should be determined by studying proposed bank protection with spur 
dikes on a site-specific basis using experiences in similar conditions or a model study. Brown 
(1985) stated that the spacing of spurs in a bank-protection scheme is a function of the spur’s 
length, angle, and permeability, as well as the channel bend’s degree of curvature. The 
direction and orientation of the channel’s flow thalweg plays a major role in determining an 
acceptable spacing between individual spurs in a bank-stabilization scheme. He gave an 
example and recommended that a spacing criteria based on the projection of a tangent to the 
flow thalweg, projected off the spur tip should be used. For the spur length, he recommended 
that the projected length of impermeable spurs should be held to less than 15 percent of the 
channel width at bank-full stage. While for permeable spurs they should be held to less than 
25 percent of the channel width. 
 
Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) stated that the spacing between spurs 
depends on the length protected by each one in the series, the curvature of the reach, the 
19
3- 
 location of spurs (whether on concave banks or convex banks), and the cost of construction 
etc. So the spacing of spurs could be varied according to different design conditions. A 
spacing of 2 to 2.5 times of the length of spurs is the general practice. For the length of spurs, 
no general rules can evidently be formulated. It depends entirely on the exigencies arising in 
a specific case. But length should not be shorter than that required to keep the scour hole 
formed at the nose away from the bank. Normally spurs longer than 1/5 the river width are 
not provided.   
 
Alvarez (1989) recommended that the length of the spur dikes should be kept between 
the following limits 
1
25
.0
B
L
y
≤
≤
 when the river bank is almost parallel to the river axis, 
where y and B1 are the mean flow depth and the mean width of the free flow surface. Also 
when spur dikes are built in straight stretches without anchoring in the bank, the spacing 
should be 4L to 6L, where L is the working spur dike length. If the curve is regular with only 
one curvature radius, 2.5~4L is optimum; if the curve is irregular, the spacing should be 
found graphically. Recommendations from several sources are shown in Table 3-1. 
 
3.2.6.2 Orientation of Spur Dikes 
 
The orientation of spur dikes has typically been determined by experience in specific 
geographical areas and by preference of engineers. There is considerable controversy as to 
whether spur dikes should be oriented with their axis in an upstream or downstream 
direction.  
 
Thomas and Watt (1913) concluded that the various alignments were probably of 
slight importance. Franzius (1927) reported that spur dikes directed upstream are superior to 
normal and downstream-oriented spur dikes with respect to bank protection as well as 
sedimentation between the dikes.  
 
Strom (1941) reported that the usual practice in New Zealand was to incline 
impermeable groins slightly upstream, but that downstream-oriented spur dikes had also been 
used successfully. Strom stated that a spur dike angled downstream tends to swing the current 
20
3- 
 below it toward midstream; this has a reflex action above the dike which may induce the 
current to attack the bank there. Thus, downstream-oriented dikes should only be used in 
series so that the downstream protection afforded by each dike extends to the one below it.

The United Nations (1953) reported that the present practice was to construct spur 
dikes either perpendicular to the bank or to orient them upstream. This publication states that 
downstream-oriented dikes tend to bring the scour hole closer to the bank. An upstream dike 
21
3- 
 angle varying between 100 and 120 degrees was recommended for bank protection. It also 
discussed how to build a system of spur dikes.  
 
Mamak (1964) stated that dikes are usually set perpendicular to the flow or set 
upstream at angles between 100 and 110 degrees.  
 
Lindner (1969), reporting on the state of knowledge for the U. S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, stated that there has not been a sufficiently comprehensive series of tests either in 
the field or by model to conclude that any acute or obtuse angle for the alignment at dikes is 
superior or even as good as perpendicular to flow. Thus, he recommended perpendicular 
dikes except in concave bendways where they should be angled sharply downstream. Neill 
(1973) recommended using upstream-oriented dikes. After reviewing much of the literature 
on spur dikes Richardson and Simons (1973) recommended perpendicular spur dikes, 
suggesting that spur dikes with angles between 100 and 110 degrees could be used to 
channelize or to guide flow.  
 
In the United States, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1978) has generally oriented 
its spur dikes perpendicular or slightly downstream. On the Missouri River, dikes are 
generally oriented downstream with an angle of 75 degrees. On the Red and Arkansas Rivers, 
dikes are placed normal to flow or at angles of 75 degree. The St. Louis District uses both 
perpendicular and downstream oriented dikes. The Los Angeles District (1980) used dikes 
with an angle of 75 degrees pointing downstream.  
 
As late as 1979, Jansen (1979) concluded that there is no definite answer as to 
whether spur dikes should be oriented upstream or downstream, and recommended using the 
cheapest solution---that being the shortest connection between the end of the dike and the 
bank. This corresponds with Lindner (1969). Copeland (1983) found that the scour depth was 
more severe for spur dikes with an upstream orientation than for those with a downstream 
orientation. And he found there is no indication that the scour hole is closer to the bank for 
spur dikes pointed downstream. He concluded that the spur dike should be oriented 
perpendicular to the bank to obtain the most effective bank protection.  
22
3- 
  
Brown (1985) recommended that retardance spurs be designed perpendicular to the 
primary flow direction and spurs within a retardance/diverter or diverter spur scheme be set 
with the upstream-most spur at approximately 30 degrees to the main flow current at the spur 
tip, and with subsequent spurs having incrementally larger angles approaching a maximum of 
90 degrees at the downstream end of the scheme. 
   
Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) has the opinion that spurs should be 
oriented perpendicular to the bank or upstream for bank protection purposes. It stated that a 
spur pointing downstream will invariably accentuate the existing conditions and may create 
undesirable results. It recommended that a repelling spur be angled 100-120 degrees 
upstream.  
 
Alvarez (1989) recommended an angle of 700 facing downstream for a regular curve 
or a straight stretch. He suggested that level-crested spur dikes may be oriented perpendicular 
or upstream forming an angle of no more than 1200. He also gives design guidelines on crest 
longitudinal slopes and elevation of spur dikes.  
 
From studies of single spur dikes (45, 90, and 1350) in a straight channel, Kuhnle et 
al. (1998) concluded that the volume of the scour hole was greatest for upstream (1350) 
facing spur dikes, while the potential for bank erosion was greatest for the downstream (450) 
facing spur dikes.   
 
There are proponents of both upstream-facing and downstream-facing spur dikes 
(Copeland, 1983).  As in other design factors of spur dikes the best orientation is most likely 
a function of the local conditions and the purpose of the structures.  There is a lack of 
agreement as to the most advantageous orientation to construct spur dikes.  Permeable spur 
dikes are usually designed to decrease the flow near the bank.  They are generally not 
strongly affected by the angle and are usually built at 90 degrees from the bank to have the 
maximum effect on near bank velocity and to use the least material (Lagasse et al., 2001).

3.2.6.3 Permeability 
 
Permeability of spur dikes is a very important factor that affects the function of the 
spur dikes and also an important design consideration. Generally, it is believed that the 
greater the spur dike permeability, the less severe the scour pattern downstream of the spur 
tip, the lower the magnitude of flow concentration at the spur tip. The more permeable the 
spur, the shorter the length of channel bank protected downstream of the spur’s riverward tip. 
 
Brown (1985) gave some recommendations for application of different spur 
permeability for different purposes as follows: (1) where it is necessary to provide a 
significant reduction in flow velocity, a high level of flow control, or where the structure is 
being used on a sharp bend, the spur’s permeability should not exceed 35 percent; (2) where 
it is necessary to provide a moderate reduction in flow velocity, a moderate level of flow 
control, or where the structure is being used on a mild to moderate channel bend, spurs with 
permeability up to 50 percent can be used; (3) spur permeability up to 80 percent can be used 
in some special cases but is not recommended; (4) jack and tetrahedron retardance spurs may 
be used only when it can be reasonably assumed that the structures will trap a sufficient 
volume of floating debris to produce an effective permeability of 60 percent or less; (5) 
Henson-type spurs should be designed to have an effective permeability of 50 percent. (6) if 
minimizing the magnitude of flow deflection and flow concentration at the spur tip is 
important to a particular spur design, a spur with a permeability greater than 35 percent 
should be used; (7) impermeable spurs should not be used along channel banks composed of 
highly erodible material unless measures are taken to protect the channel banks in this area.  
 
Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) discussed the construction, types, and 
application of permeable and impermeable spurs. It stated that permeable spurs have the 
important advantage of being cheap and are effective only in rivers which carry heavy 
suspended load. But they are usually not strong enough to resist shocks and pressures from 
debris, floating ice and logs. Submerged permeable spurs are preferable to submerged solid 
spurs since the former do not create turbulent and eddy conditions as strong as with the latter 
in the case of deep and narrow rivers where depths are considerable. Impermeable spurs are 
24
3- 
 unsuitable in boulder rivers, in streams where there is a clay layer beneath sand –as in 
deltaic rivers-at the nose of the spurs, and in flashy rivers in which floods rise and fall so 
quickly that desired silting does not take place.  
 
Spur dikes with permeability up to about 35 percent do not affect the length of the 
channel bank protected.  For permeability values above 35 percent, the length of bank 
protected decreases with increasing permeability.  High permeability spur dikes generally are 
most suitable for mild bends where small reductions in flow are sought.  Permeable spur 
dikes may be susceptible to damage from debris and ice (Lagasse et al., 2001). 
 
 
3.2.6.4 Spur Height, Crest Profile, and Spur Head Form 
 
The spur height should be sufficient to protect the regions of the channel bank 
impacted by the erosion processes active at the particular site. Although the general practice 
in design of spur dikes in the field has mostly been  to place all dike crests at about the same 
height with respect to low water level, the crest or crown of a dike need not be horizontal 
depending on what effect of dike upon flow is sought (Klingeman et al. 1984). There are 
often situations where a variable-height crown is advantageous. The sloping-crown or 
stepped-down crown, in which the dike crown slopes downward or is stepped downward 
from bank to mid-channel, appears to have an advantage where acceleration of  shoal erosion 
is needed over a wide range of stages but where a gradually-diminishing channel contraction 
with increasing stage will suffice. Such a crown design may be required where a spur dike 
with a level crown would produce objectionable velocities as the stage rises. It often will be 
less costly to build a stepped-down crown dike than a level crown one if high velocities are 
not a concern and if the sloping spur dike can produce the shoal erosion desired (Lindner 
1969). There is also less tendency for flanking or scouring near the bank ends to occur with 
sloping dikes than with level dikes (Franco, 1967).  
 
Furthermore, Franco (1967) concluded that stepped-down spur dike systems (a dike is 
low with respect to the next dike upstream) are more effective in reducing disturbances of 
25
3- 
 channel flow and inducing more sediment deposition in the dike field than systems with all 
dikes level and that level dike fields are more effective than stepped-up fields. He also 
recommended that level-crested dikes be placed normal to the flow or oriented downstream 
and sloping crested dikes be normal to the flow or oriented upstream.  
 
There are different spur head forms that function quite differently when placed in the 
river channel. Ahmad (1953) classified them in four types as straight, hockey, inverted 
hockey and T-headed. His tests showed that the maximum depth of scour and area of the 
apron needed at the T-headed spur are relatively small compared with straight and hockey 
spurs. He also concluded that the T-headed spur is economical in stone. The interesting thing 
to be noticed from his data is that the minimum scour depth occurred at the inverted hockey 
spur.  
 
Franco (1967) performed experiments with the length of the L-head (similar to 
inverted hockey type spur by Ahmad) equal to half of the distance between the ends of 
adjacent dikes. He found that the L-head tended to prevent sediment-carrying bottom currents 
from moving into the areas between the dikes. Maximum scour depth at the ends of the dikes 
was reduced appreciably, as was the elevation of deposition between spur dikes.  
 
In a series of tests by Linder et al. (1964) it was found that the L-head should close 45 
to 65 percent of the gap between the dikes in a dike field, and that little benefit was derived 
from building the L-head above the water surface. The results indicated that the L-heads 
decreased the scour around the ends of the spur dikes compared with stubbed-off dikes, and 
improve navigation conditions and depths by reducing eddy disturbances and by causing the 
contraction to persist more continuously along the dike system, thus producing more uniform 
bed configuration and consistent depths. In addition, almost any reasonable degree of closure 
will give added protection to the concave bank over no closure at all. However, L-heads are 
expensive so that additional testing and experience are needed to show whether their merits 
are sufficient to recommend their general use in connection with channel contraction. 
 
J-heads, which are similar to hockey-stick-shaped spur dikes, together with T-heads 
26
3- 
 are also designed with the hope of improving their function. However, there has not been 
enough investigation of these various shapes to ascertain whether they have any advantage 
over the L-head. It is believed that the J-head as well as the T-head would possess 
disadvantages that would make their choice over the L-head injudicious, except possibly for 
certain specific purposes. In addition, under any condition it would appear that the upstream 
leg should not be as high as the remainder of the dike (Lindner 1969). 
 
Brown (1985) recommended that: (1) if the design flow stage is lower than the 
channel bank height, spurs should be designed to a height no more than three feet lower than 
the design flow stage; if higher, to bank height; (2) permeable spurs should be designed to a 
height that will permit the passage of heavier debris over the spur crest and not cause 
structural damage; (3) when possible, impermeable spurs should be designed to be 
submerged by approximately three feet under their worst design flow condition, thus 
minimizing the impacts of local scour and flow concentration at the spur tip and the 
magnitude of flow deflection; (4) for spur crest file, permeable spurs should be designed with 
level crests unless bank height or other special conditions dictate the use of a sloping crest 
design; impermeable spurs should be designed with a slight fall towards the spur head, thus 
allowing different amounts of flow constriction with stage (particularly important in narrow-
width channels), and the accommodation of changes in meander trace with stages; (5) a 
simple straight spur head form is recommended and the spur head or tip should be as smooth 
and rounded as possible.   
 
3.2.6.5 Other Design Considerations 
 
There are several other design considerations including the channel bed and channel 
bank contact, spur systems geometry, extent of channel bank protection, etc. Brown (1985) 
and FHWA (2001) gave recommendations and design examples of spur dikes including all 
these aspects.

3.2.7 
Application of Spur dikes  
 
Spur dikes are used to alter flow direction, induce deposition, or reduce flow velocity.  
Their main use is to protect banks that contain bridge abutments from eroding.  Spur dikes 
are commonly used to realign streams as they approach a bridge abutment.  A bridge 
abutment may be in danger of being severely eroded when it is subjected to high velocity 
flow from a channel that has changed course due to meandering of the channel. Spur dikes 
may also be used to establish and maintain the alignment of a channel.  They have been used 
to decrease the length of the bridge required and reduce the cost and maintenance of the 
bridge in actively migrating braided channels (Lagasse et al., 2001).   
 
A groin with a submerged dike at its toe was constructed on the coast of Washington 
to protect a stretch of state highway from destruction due to shore erosion. It was found that 
the structure performed well as expected and has helped relocate the deep tidal channel 500 
to 2000 feet further away from the shore in spite of some expected scour development at the 
toe of the dike (Sultan et al. 2002).  
 
According to Richardson et al. (1984), spurs may protect stream banks at less cost 
than riprap revetment, and by deflecting the current away from the bank and causing 
deposition, they may more effectively protect banks from erosion than revetment. Uses other 
than bank protection include the constriction of long reaches of wide, braided streams to 
establish a stable channel, constriction of short reaches to establish a desired flow path and to 
increase sediment transport capacity, and control of flow at a bend.  
 
 
 
3.3 Hardpoints  
 
Hardpoints consist of stone fills spaced along an eroding bank line, protruding only 
short distances into the channel. A root section extends landward to preclude flanking. 
Hardpoints are most effective along straight or relatively flat convex banks where the 
streamlines are parallel to the bank lines and velocities are not greater than 3 m/s within 15 m 
28
3- 
 of the bank line. Hardpoints may be appropriate for use in long, straight reaches where bank 
erosion occurs mainly from a wandering thalweg at lower flow rate. They would not be 
effective in halting or reversing bank erosion in a meander bend unless they were closely 
spaced, in which case spurs, retarder structures, or bank revetment would probably cost less 
(HEC-23). 
 
 
3.4 Guide banks 
 
3.4.1 
Introduction 
 
Guide banks are earth or rock embankments placed at abutments to improve the flow 
alignment and move the local scour away from the embankment and bridge abutment.  The 
major use of guide banks in the United States has been to prevent erosion by eddy action at 
bridge abutments or piers where concentrated flood flow traveling along the upstream side of 
an approach embankment enters the main flow at the bridge (HEC-23). There also have been 
various studies on guide banks. Among those studies are Spring (1903), Karaki (1959, 1961) 
Bradley (1978), Brice and Blodgett (1978), Chitale (1980), Smith (1984), Neill (1973), 
Richardson et al. (1984), and Lagasse et al. (2001). Guide bank orientation, length, crest 
height, shape and size, downstream extent and as many other concerns are investigated. 
Design guidelines for guide banks are given in Neil (1973), Bradley (1978), Ministry of 
Works and Development (1979), Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) and Lagasse 
et al. (1995, 2001). These studies are reviewed below. 
 
Guide banks provide a smooth transition for flow on the floodplain to the main 
channel.  The effectiveness of guide banks is a function of river geometry, quantity of flow 
on the floodplain, and size of bridge opening (Richardson et al. 1984). By establishing 
smooth parallel streamlines in the approaching flow, guide banks improve flow conditions in 
the bridge waterway. Scour, if it occurs, is near the upstream end of the guide bank away 
from the bridge. 
 
29
3- 
 
Guide banks can protect not only bridge abutments from local scour, but also the 
approach embankment because of the still water area behind it. When embankments span 
wide floodplains, the flows from high waters must be aligned to flow smoothly through the 
bridge opening. Overbank flows on the floodplain can severely erode the approach 
embankment and could increase the depth of the scour at the bridge abutment.  Guide banks 
can be used to redirect the flow from the embankment and to transfer the scour away from 
the abutment.  Guide banks serve to reduce the separation of flow at the upstream abutment 
face and maximize the total bridge waterway area, and reduce the abutment scour by 
lessening the turbulence at the abutment face (Lagasse et al., 2001).   
 
There are practically two kinds of guide banks. One is the American practice, which 
is to give guide banks an elliptical form convergent to the opening, whereas the other in 
Pakistan and India, guide banks are straight and parallel to the opening with a curved section 
at the upstream and downstream ends. Mahmood stated that parallel guide banks straighten 
the flow more effectively than convergent ones (Richardson et al., 1984).  
 
Design guidelines for guide banks are given in Neil (1973), Bradley (1978), Ministry 
of Works and Development (1979), Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) and 
Lagasse et al. (1995).  
 
3.4.2 
Experimental Studies 
 
Karaki (1959, 1961) carried out a laboratory study in a flume 16 ft wide and 84 ft 
long with an erodible bed for clear-water flow on the floodplain with a spill-through 
abutment, wing-wall abutment and skewed embankments models. He concluded: (1) guide 
banks are effective measures to reduce scour at bridge abutments and the effectiveness of 
guide banks is a function of the geometry of the roadway embankments, flow on the 
floodplain, and size of bridge opening. (2) The proper location for an earth embankment 
guide bank is at the abutment with the slope of the guide bank tangent to the slope of the 
abutment. (3) Curved guide banks are more efficient than straight ones because of the 
smoother streamlining of the flow. He graphically set forth tentative criteria for design 
30
3- 
 derived from his qualitative experiment results. This criterion has limitations because: the 
results are qualitative and performed with uniform approach flow; an arbitrary time limit of 5 
minutes was imposed for east test for the study.  
 
Herbich (1967) studied the effect of guide banks on the flow pattern at the bridge 
crossing using a fixed-bed model and a movable-bed model. In the fixed-bed model, he 
found, in the case of a 90 degrees approach, that: (1) the guide banks produced a marked 
improvement in the uniformity of velocity across the constriction; (2) the length of the guide 
banks appear to be unimportant in reduction of velocities provided it is greater than a certain 
minimum length; (3) the contraction ratio is important and the average reduction in velocities 
to about nine tenths of the original (without guide banks) is evident for each of them; (4) the 
patterns of reduction are a function of the contraction ratios and it is more significant than the 
average reduction; (5) with the abutment skewed at 60 degrees to the flow, the addition of the 
guide banks decreases the velocities along the upstream abutment to as low as sixty percent 
of the original (without guide banks); on the downstream side the velocities increase from the 
twenty three percent contraction but decreases for the other contractions. In a few tests of 
movable bed studies, Herbich found that the scour with clear-water is greater than the scour 
with sediment-transporting flow.  
 
Smith (1984) presented a paper covering the chronology of events at the east 
abutment of Outlook Bridge on the South Saskatchewan River from 1936 to 1981. Abutment 
scour on the prototype under flood conditions was observed to extend about 5 m below the 
footing, endangering the stability of the structure. After failure of an attempted remedial 
countermeasure using bags filled with sand-cement, a 1:100 scale, erodible, sand bed model 
was constructed and tested using guide wall and riprap as countermeasures. The model 
included an abutment and two bridge spans. Three steel sheet pile guide walls of different 
lengths (Wall A is 60 cm long, Wall B is 30 cm long and a semicircular cell C) were 
simulated with galvanized sheet metal. The alignment of wall A and B formed a quarter 
ellipse in plan. The tests were performed under clear-water conditions and each test was run 
for 1 hour. It was found that the longest guide wall completely eliminated the scour at the 
abutment. But there is a 3.8 cm scour hole at the upstream end of the guide wall. A less 
31
3- 
 desirable feature of this design was that the train of secondary scour holes passed through 
the position of the first piers and caused an increase in pier scour. The 30-cm guide wall also 
produced ideal protection for the abutment and no increase in pier scour, but head end scour 
was increased about 1 cm to 4.8 cm. With the half-cell on the upstream face of the abutment, 
a conical scour hole of 6.0 cm deep developed. The scour extended so far around the half-cell 
that the approach grade was severely scoured on one side and the footing was exposed on the 
other. It was concluded that the half-cell was not a satisfactory alternative. The 30-cm wall 
was considered to be the most promising. However, a single wall cantilevered out of the river 
bed was considered vulnerable to damage by ice and also of questionable stability if there 
was scour on the flow side and no scour on the other side. Accordingly, a variation of a 30-
cm wall was selected for further study, and consisted of a multi-cell guide wall of the type so 
often used for steel cofferdams. It was found that this wall not only can protect the abutment 
as well as the former 30-cm wall, but also shows more stability than the first one. It was 
concluded that abutment scour could be controlled with an earth guide bank, consisting of a 
30-cm cellular sheet pile guide wall. Test results for the cellular steel guide wall were judged 
to be most reliable in terms of predicting prototype behavior, and this design appeared to give 
an ideal solution. A particularly desirable feature of the guide wall was that it eliminated all 
attack on the upstream face of the highway grade at the abutment. In 1970 it was decided to 
add an earth guide bank to the existing riprap protection. The most recent sounding in June 
1981 showed no change in riprap position, and the abutment was well protected by the 
combination of the guide bank and the riprap.  
 
 
3.4.3 
Guide Bank Design Considerations 
 
The important factors for guide bank design are orientation relative to the bridge 
opening, plan shape, length (upstream and downstream of the abutment), cross-sectional 
shape, crest elevation, and protection of the structure from sour. These aspects are discussed 
below.  
 
32
3- 
 
3.4.3.1 Plan Shape 
 
Guide banks with elliptical shape, straight, and straight with curved ends were found 
to have satisfactory performance in the field. The plan shape of the guide banks depends on 
the type of channel (meander or braided), direction of the streamlines of the flow 
approaching the opening and location of the crossing (Richardson et al., 1984). It can be 
divergent, convergent or parallel. Conflicting recommendations on the plan shape of guide 
banks occur in the literature, but majority opinion favors converging curved banks forming a 
bell-mouth entry to the waterway opening. Straight, parallel guide banks can be used 
successfully in certain situations, but in general they tend to cause formation of a bar 
alongside one bank, thereby concentrating the flow on the other side of the waterway 
opening. Divergent guide banks, elliptical guide banks and also straight guide banks with 
composite curve for upstream head are found in India.  
 
Two guide banks are generally required when the waterway opening is located in the 
middle of a wide floodplain or braided stream where the direction of the main flow can shift 
from side to side. A single guide bank may be sufficient when the stream is confined to one 
side of a valley or where advantage can be taken of a natural inerodible bank on one side 
(Neill, 1973).  
 
3.4.3.2 Length  
 
There is no hard and fast rule regarding the length of the guide banks to be adopted 
normally. Views of different authorities are cited below. Guide banks at study sites tended to 
be longer than recommended by Bradley (1978) at most sites, except at five sites where they 
ranged from 5 m to 23 m. All guide banks appeared to perform satisfactorily. Not enough 
short guide banks were included in the study to reach conclusions regarding length (HEC-
23).  
 
Karaki (1959, 1961) concluded that as the length of guide banks increases, there is an 
33
3- 
 increase of the width of spread of the concentrated flow, which leads to a reduction of local 
velocity and results in smaller depth of scour. However, Herbich (1967) suggested that length 
of guide banks are not important provided they are over a certain length and this is usually 
satisfied when a certain shape is developed. 
 
Spring (1903) has the opinion that the length of guide bank is dependant on the 
following considerations: first, the distance necessary to secure a straight run for the river 
through the bridge; and secondly, the length necessary to prevent the formation of a bend of 
the river, above and behind the guide banks, circuitous enough to breach the main railway 
approach bank; thirdly, it depends to a certain extent on the length of the bridge for a given 
river, provided that the bridge is designed so that all its spans shall be acting fairly equally, 
instead of some having considerably more flow than others; fourthly, the upstream length of 
the guide banks is dependant also to some extent on the breadth of the unnarrowed river.  
 
Spring suggested that (1) the length of the upstream part of the guide banks may be 
made equal to or up to a tenth longer than the bridge. But close attention should be paid to the 
possibility of the river eroding the main approach bank. In especially wide rivers this may 
involve the use of very long guide banks; (2) the length of the downstream part of the guide 
bank may be a tenth to a fifth of the length of the bridge so that the swirl downstream of the 
bridge can be kept far enough away not to endanger the approach bank.  
 
Karaki (1959, 1961) gave a tentative method to determine the length of the guide 
banks based on the laboratory data obtained. Based on the information obtained from model 
studies performed at Colorado State University, field data collected by the U.S. Geological 
Survey during floods in the State of Mississippi, and field observations by Schneible during 
floods, Bradley (1978) developed a chart for determine the length of guide banks. In this 
chart, the discharge ratio 
100
/Q
Q f
(
f
Q  is the lateral or floodplain flow on one side measured 
at a certain section, cfs; 
100
Q
 is the discharge in 100 feet of stream adjacent to abutment, 
measured at a designated section, cfs.) is shown as the ordinate, the length of dike L  as the 
abscissa, and the family of curves are for different values of the average velocity through 
bridge opening. He also suggested that for skewed crossings, the length of guide banks be set 
34
3- 
 using the monograph for the side of the bridge crossing which yields the longest guide bank 
length, if guide banks are required on both sides of the channel. 
 
3.4.3.3 Radius of Curved Head 
 
Karaki (1959, 1961) stated that there is a multiplicity of curved shapes that could be 
used: parabolic, hyperbolic, spiral, elliptical, and circular. But of these, the elliptical is 
probably the simplest geometrical shape and the one to be considered because of its 
adaptability to field layout. Among those elliptical, the one with a 2.5:1 major to minor axis 
ratio is shown to the most effective.  
 
Herbich (1967) recommended that for a 90 degree approach, (1) a curved guide bank 
should be used and a spiral shape may fulfill the requirements; (2) the guide banks should be 
designed for maximum flood flow and they should be protected and maintained regularly. 
For a 60 degree approach, besides some of those recommendations above, he suggested that 
(1) guide banks at both abutments are necessary and for the upstream one, an elliptical shape 
with axis ratio of 2.5:1 is the most effective and for the downstream guide bank straight at 5-
degree inclination toward the center of the opening. A tail end, curved in shape is necessary 
at the downstream corner of the downstream abutment. (2) For the upstream abutment, a 
comparatively long guide bank is needed in case the scour hole is attracted to the abutment.  
 
Chitale (1980) discussed the radius of curved heads of upstream guide banks and 
found that there are big discrepancies between different methods for determining the radius 
proposed by different investigators and the field data are not sufficient to prove which is 
better or not.  
 
3.4.3.4 Guide Bank Slope and Its Protection 
 
The proper section of the guide bank is probably the most important thing to be 
considered. Cheapness of construction of guide banks is essential because the chief object of 
35
3- 
 guide banks is that the cost of an unduly long bridge may be saved. Therefore, instead of 
building a high wall on deep foundations, the engineer makes his guide banks of sand and 
earth on a plan suitable for the proper guidance of the river currents and for the 
discouragement of swirls; then he lays such a covering of loose stone, boulders, riprap, or 
one-man-rock, over the exposed part of them, as will serve to protect them against every 
conceivable kind of attack to which they are liable (Spring, 1903). Spring stated that in India 
one-man-rocks weighing from 60 to 120 lbs with irregular angles are suitable for the 
armoring of the guide bank slopes. Although rocks with high specific gravity, say 3.0, are 
preferred, rocks with a specific gravity of 2.44 are usually used because of its cheapness and 
availability. Recommendations for the thickness of stone pitching and soling for permanent 
slopes required at the head, body, and tail of guide banks, for river flowing in alluvial plains  
can be found in Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989). 
 
In the Guidelines for Design and Construction of River Training and Control Works 
for Road Bridges published by the Indian Roads Congress (1985), the size of stone required 
on the sloping face of the guide banks on the river side is given as 
2
0282
.0
U
Dr =
 for 2:1 
side slope and 
2
0216
.0
U
Dr =
 for 3:1 side slope. 
 
Bradley (1978) suggested that if rock is used as a facing on a guide bank, it should be 
well graded and a filter blanket should be used if the relative gradations of the rock and of the 
guide bank material require it. If it is constructed of earth, it should be compacted to the same 
standards as the roadway embankment and should extend above expected high water.  
 
Riprap can be used to inhibit erosion of the embankment materials. As an alternative, 
guide banks can be constructed entirely of riprap-size material, if such material is readily 
available. Rock riprap should be placed on the stream-side face as well as around the end of 
the guide bank. It is not necessary to riprap the side of the guide bank adjacent to the 
highway approach embankment. The designer is referred to standard references such as 
HEC-11 (FHWA, 1989), Richardson et al. (1990), or Pagan-Ortiz (1991) for design 
procedures for sizing riprap at abutments. Riprap should be extended below the bed elevation 
to a depth as recommended in HEC-11. Additional riprap should be placed around the 
36
3- 
 upstream end (nose) of the guide bank to counter the effects of scour expected at this 
location.  
3.4.3.5 Apron  
 
To obviate damages due to scour at the toe of the guide banks with consequent 
undermining and collapse of the stone pitching, a stone cover, know as apron, should be laid 
beyond the toe on the horizontal river bed, so that scour undermines the apron first, starting at 
its farthest end and works backward towards the slope. Adequate quantity of stone for the 
apron has to be provided to ensure complete protection of the whole of the scoured face. This 
quantity will obviously depend on the apron thickness, depth of scour and the slope of the 
launched apron. These along with size of stone are considered by different investigators.  
 
In the conventional practice in India following Spring, Gales, Inglis and Sethi, the 
size for stone should be the same as that used from pitching on the slope of guide banks. 
Each stone weighs about 35 to 55 kg.  
 
According to Spring (1903), It is important to make sure that the apron is made broad 
enough and thick enough not only to cover up the erodible matter exposed by sub-surface 
erosion, but also to keep the deep part of the erosion so far off, that the automatically-pitched 
sub-surface slope may have an inclination of fully two to one. The apron stone should be laid, 
all along the foot of the slope stone, at a breadth equal to 1.5 times the maximum depth of 
scour, and of an average thickness equal to 1.88 times the thickness of the slope stone layer. 
He also recommended that instead of being given a uniform thickness all over, the apron be 
made of the same thickness as that of the slope at the place where slope and apron join, and 
about 2.75 times that thickness at its outer fringe.  
 
Observations at guide banks on various rivers have shown that the actual slopes of 
launched aprons range from 1.5:1 to 3:1, and are even flatter. However, in most cases the 
average approximates to 2:1. The face slopes of the launched apron, should not, therefore, be 
assumed steeper than 2:1 or flatter than 3:1 (Central Board of Irrigation and Power). Bell, the 
originator of the guide bank system, recommended a breadth of apron equal to 1.25 times the 
37
3- 
 scour depth below the bed level at which the apron is laid. Spring suggested from his 
considerable experience that it should not be less than 1.5 times the scour depth for the shank 
and 2 times for the head, as has been adopted also by Gales. In addition to 1.5 times the scour 
depth, Gales provides an extra 4.6 to 7.6 m width of apron at the foot of the slope, which he 
calls the berm.  
 
Regarding the thickness of apron as laid, people found that according to Spring’s 
recommendations, when the apron is completely launched, its thickness is less than that of 
the permanent slope near its toe. This deficiency in the distribution of stone was overcome 
differently by different engineers. Gales advocated the uniform apron and provision of a 
berm, which is only an addition length of the apron.   
 
3.4.3.6 Construction and Maintenance  
 
The construction process is important to help keep the cost of guide bank low and 
guarantee the completion of the guide bank in time. Several factors to be considered are the 
magnitude of construction arrangements for earthwork, the magnitude of construction 
arrangements for stone, time available for construction and labor availability.  
 
No matter how well they are designed at the beginning, guide banks may find 
themselves exposed during some period of their existence, at some part of their perimeter, to 
scour so severe that there seems danger. Therefore, maintenance work is necessary. Service 
tracks should be made and maintained in case train loads of stones are required to be 
transported to a threatened place.  
 
Because stone has to be thrown in from time to time as apron stone gets washed 
away,  maintenance may be very expensive-as exemplified by the case of the Hardinge 
Bridge, where nearly a million pounds was spent on repairs in a period of two years(Inglis, 
1949).  
 
Bradley (1978) suggested that: (1) deep trees as close to the toe of the guide bank 
38
3- 
 embankment as construction will permit; (2) do not allow the cutting of channels or the 
digging of borrow pits near guide banks or along the upstream side of embankments; (3) if 
drainage is important, put small pipe through guide bank or embankment to drain pockets left 
behind banks after floods recedes.  
 
Brice and Blodgett (1978) compiled case histories and provided information on scour 
and countermeasures at 224 bridge sites. Guide bank performance was found to be generally 
satisfactory at all study sites evaluated. They found that most guide banks are constructed of 
earth with revetment to inhibit erosion. At two sites, guide banks of concrete rubble masonry 
performed well. Riprap revetment is most common, but concrete revetment with rock riprap 
toe protection, rock-and-wire mattress, gabions, grass sods have also performed satisfactorily. 
Since partial failure of a guide bank during a flood usually will not endanger the bridge, 
wider consideration should be given to the use of vegetative cover for protection. Partial 
failure of any countermeasure is usually of little significance so long as the purpose of 
protecting the highway stream crossing is accomplished.  
 
3.4.3.7 Conclusions 
 
Properly designed guide banks and abutment riprap provide an acceptable alternative 
to designing bridge abutments to withstand the development of the full scour prism predicted 
by equations currently available for estimating abutment scour. Since they have excellent 
performance in the field, guide banks should be given serious considerations as a 
countermeasure for abutment scour when developing plans for repair or replacement of those 
endangered bridges. They can eliminate many scour problems associated with bridge 
crossings and their use can result in a worthwhile savings to the highway program. 
 
3.5 Collars  
 
Another type of countermeasure that was found helpful for pier scour was a kind of 
appurtenance called collars. Basically it is a piece of circular or rectangular shaped steel plate 
39
3- 
 attached around the pier sitting horizontally a short distance from the bed.  Papers of collars 
on abutment scour protection were not found in the literature. 
 
3.6 Summary 
 
Although many studies have been carried out for each of these countermeasures, there 
are still needs for further studies of their use in protecting bridge abutments. For instance, 
spur dikes have not specifically been tested and used for abutment protection. Guide banks 
have been tested and used for spill-through abutments on rivers with wide floodplains or 
rectangular channel only. For small country bridges with wing-wall abutments terminating on 
the main channel bank, studies are still needed. In addition, there are many controversial 
design guidelines and small design issues that need to be clarified. Collars have been tested 
for pier scour protection rather for abutment protection.  
 
Countermeasures are often damaged or destroyed by the stream, and stream banks 
and beds often erode at locations where no countermeasure was installed. However, as long 
as the primary objectives are achieved in the short-term as a result of countermeasure 
installation, the countermeasure installation can be deemed a success (HEC-23). Therefore, to 
achieve long-term protection, maintenance, reconstruction, and installation of additional 
countermeasures as the responses of streams and rivers to natural and man-induced changes 
is needed.  
 
Among armoring countermeasures, riprap and cable tied blocks are of the most 
interest by hydraulic engineers. These two countermeasures have been investigated by 
various researchers as erosion control devices and bank revetments. Since studies of riprap 
and cable tied blocks are not included here, the literature is not reviewed herein.

CHAPTER 4. EXPERIMENTAL APARATUS AND PROCEDURE 
 
6.1 The Flume 
 
All of the experiments were conducted in a flume located in the hydraulic laboratory 
at the USDA-ARS National Sedimentation Laboratory, Oxford, MS. The flume channel was 
30 m long, 1.2 m wide and 0.6 m deep, and was supported in the center at two points and on 
the ends by four screw jacks that allow the channel slope to be adjusted. The wing-wall 
abutment model was located over a 3 m long, 1.2 m wide, by 1.2 m deep recessed section of 
the flume 22 m downstream from the inlet tank. The test section was 22 m downstream from 
the inlet and the channel was 1.2 m wide, thereby making the test section 18 times the width 
downstream from the inlet.  This is enough to ensure fully-developed flow at the test section.  
Uniform flow was established for each experimental run by the adjustment of the flume 
slopes and pump speed until the water surface line, the bed surface and the flume slope were 
parallel to one another along a 12 m transect in the approach channel.  The channel section of 
the experiments is illustrated in Fig. 4-1. A flume photo is shown in Figure 4-2 that indicates 
all of the elements in the flume, such as the abutment model, floodplain, main channel, 
instrument carriage and flume inlet and outlet etc. A compound channel was used in all 
experiments consisting of an asymmetric floodplain of width 320 mm next to a main channel, 
with a bank slope of 1:1. The elevation difference between the top of the floodplain and the 
main channel bed was 80 mm. The rigid floodplain was made of galvanized steel plate and 
glued down onto the flume bottom.  A layer of sand was glued onto the floodplain to add 
roughness.  In addition, since most floodplains are heavily vegetated and therefore have high 
roughness, gravel with a mean diameter of 4.5 cm was placed in a staggered arrangement on 
the floodplain in later runs of baseline cases (Fig. 4-3). By measuring both the velocity 
profiles in the main channel and on the floodplain and by using Manning’s equation, the 
roughness of the floodplain and the main channel bed under clear-water condition (a velocity 
ratio of 0.9) were found to be 0.030 and 0.014, respectively.

6.1 The Abutment Model 
 
The wing-wall abutment model was made of sheet steel. The dimensions of the model 
are shown in Fig. 4-4. The abutment terminated on the bank slope of the main channel as 
illustrated in Fig. 4-1, which corresponds to the Type III abutment of Melville (1992). The 
height between the top of the floodplain and the top of the abutment was 60 mm.  The 
abutment length was about 1/3 of the channel width and was observed not to alter the flow 
enough to interact with the far flume wall.   
 
6.1 Sediment Characteristics

According to a modified version of Shields diagram (Miller et al., 1977), the critical shear 
velocity of the bed sediment is 1.995 cm/s. In live-bed conditions, the sediments were 
circulated with the water by the pump. At the upstream inlet of the flume a gradual-transition 
contraction was built to guide the sediment into the main channel.

Three flows were used with velocity ratios (

distribution relation for a rectangular cross-section, rough wall, and free surface as shown in 
Equation (4-2) above.  
 
For clear-water conditions (

(

bed forms migrated past the abutment.   
 
6.1 Instrumentation 
 
 
7
4- 
Velocity profiles were collected 15 m downstream of the inlet tank with a 2-mm 
outside diameter total head tube mounted on a point gage at the channel centerline. Flow rate 
in the flume was measured using a pressure transducer connected to a Venturi meter in the 
return pipe. Flow depth was controlled by the volume of water in the flume and measured by 
taking the difference in elevation between the bed and water surface over a 12-m long 
transect in the approach section. Water surface and bed surface profiles were collected using 
two acoustic distance measurement devices, the remote measurement unit (RMU) that 
operates in air and the BASIS (bed form and sediment information system) that operates 
underwater.  These instruments were mounted on an instrument carriage, which traveled on 
rails over the channel. The instrument carriage was equipped with a computer-controlled 3-
axis precision positioning system which allowed transects of the scour hole to be 
automatically collected using the BASIS.  The bed elevation of the area in the vicinity of the 
abutment was measured at the completion of the clear-water experiments using the BASIS.  
For the live-bed experiments, the bed elevation of a 2.5-m long flow parallel transect from 13 
to 50 mm from the abutment (depending on the size of the bed forms) was measured 
continuously for 125 min after the scour reached equilibrium state. The probe of the BASIS 
detects the bed elevation once every minute at a certain point along this transect.  The 
distance between two successive points detected along the transect by the probe is about 1.5 
cm.  The time-averaged and instantaneous scour depth adjacent to the abutment were 
determined from this record.   Flow depth was also measured and checked using the point 
gage. 
6.1 Experimental Procedure 
 
1. Place the abutment model (with or without countermeasure models) in the flume. 
2. Level the sediment bed surface with the scraper blade mounted on the carriage that 
rode on the rails. 
3. Wet and drain the flume completely. 
4. Collect the profile of the bed surface using the RMU. 
5. Fill the flume with water and obtain the desired depth. 
6. Collect an initial set of transects of the scour region around the abutment using the 
BASIS program. 
 
8
4- 
7. Set the predetermined flume slope and start the pump. 
8. Adjust the pump speed to obtain uniform flow at the selected flow depth using the 
point gages by measuring the water surface elevation at both ends of the 12-m 
transect in the center of the channel. Check further the water surface slope along the 
12-m transect using the RMU device to ensure the uniformity of the flow. Maintain 
the same rate of flow and approach depth for the entire experimental run. 
9. Collect transects of the scour region at 30 min intervals. Increase this time interval to 
60 min to 90 min or more as the experiment progresses and changes in the scour 
region become slower. 
10. Continue the experiment until the changes in the scour hole become very slow 
(approximately 80 hours). 
11. Stop the pump, dewater the flume carefully and contour the scour hole. 
12. Take a photo of the scour hole.

CHAPTER 5. BASELINE EXPERIMENT 
 
6.1  Clear-water Scour Baselines 
6.3.1 
Experimental Results 
 
In order to study the efficiency of a certain type of countermeasure in preventing 
scour at the bridge abutment, the baseline scour, i.e., the scour depth at the bridge abutment 
without any countermeasures was determined first as a reference.  Several runs of 
experiments were carried out under clear-water scour conditions with a velocity ratio of 0.9 
to determine the worst scour scenario at the bridge abutment. These experiments were done 
with varying flow depths both in the floodplain and in the main channel. The floodplain was 
first roughened only with sand of the same size as the bed material and later was further 
roughened with staggered gravel. The gravel was used to simulate a rough floodplain and had 
a mean diameter of 4.5 cm. The placement of the gravel is shown in Figure 4-3. Table 5-1 is 
the experimental results of these baseline tests.

6.3.2 Discussion of Clear-water Baseline Experimental Results 
5.1.2.1 Scour pattern 
 
Two scour patterns were discovered depending upon the difference of the roughness 
on the floodplain.  Without gravel on the floodplain the scour pattern of Fig. 5-1 occurred in 
which there were five scour locations.  Tests B1 ~B4 (not roughened with gravel) had similar 
scour patterns.  The first scour hole, Zone A, was at the upstream corner of the abutment and 
posed the greatest threat to the stability of the abutment. Scour in Zone B was located some 
distance away from the abutment face in the bridge crossing and was where the maximum 
scour hole was located.  Since it was away from the abutment, it was considered to not 
threaten the abutment. Scour in Zone C was a short distance downstream of the abutment.  
This scour zone may pose a threat to the main channel bank immediately downstream of the 
abutment.  Scour in Zone D was far out into the main channel and, therefore, posed no threat 
to the abutment. Scour in Zone E was located at a short distance upstream of the abutment 
corner and seemed to be the initial part of Scour Zone B. With gravel on floodplain Test B5 
had a slightly different scour pattern as shown in Fig. 5-2, where scour Zones A, B and E 
merged to be the maximum scour location and was located at the upstream corner of the 
abutment.

5.1.2.2 Scour Mechanism 
 
In the base-line experiments, it was found that each of the scour zones identified in 
Tests B1~B5 was formed by different mechanisms.  In Zone A scour was caused by a 
combination of a downward roller from the water striking the upstream abutment corner, 
return flow from the floodplain flowing down towards the main channel bed, and vortex 
shedding from the upstream abutment corner.  In Zone B scour was caused by a secondary 
vortex oriented horizontally and parallel to the streamwise flow direction.  Scour in Zone C 
was caused by the wake vortex induced by flow separation. Scour in Zone D was caused by 
an increase in main channel velocity above the critical value for sediment movement caused 
by abutment-induced contraction scour. Scour in Zone E was simply the initial part of scour 
Zone B and was caused by the flow coming down from the floodplain into the main channel. 
A general scour pattern was shown in Fig. 5-3.

5.1.2.3 Effect of Floodplain Roughness on Scour Depth at Upstream Corner of  
            the Abutment 
 
The mechanisms of the formation of the four scour holes in Test B1~B4 were 
explained above.  Also, it was seen that the maximum scour depth was found in the bridge 
crossing a distance away from the abutment instead of being at the upstream corner of the 
abutment.  It then was hypothesized that the reason the maximum scour depth was not 
located right at the upstream corner of the abutment was because the velocity ratio between 
the floodplain flow and the main channel flow was so high that the floodplain flow was able 
to jet into the main channel a distance away in front of the abutment instead of being fully 
confined around the abutment corner.  To solve this problem with the hope of the maximum 
scour depth taking place right at the upstream corner of the abutment, the floodplain was 
further roughened with gravel of average diameter 4.5 cm as shown in Fig. 4-2.   As was 
expected, the result in Fig. 5-2 showed that the scour in Zones A, B and E merged and the 
maximum scour hole was found right at the upstream corner of the abutment.   
 
 
 
5
5- 
 
5.1.2.4 Effect of Main Channel Height on Scour 
 
The shooting effect must also be caused by the main channel bank height together 
with a relatively high velocity ratio between floodplain and main channel.  In another words, 
the main channel bank height is also an important parameter that affects the abutment scour 
pattern in a Type II (Melville, 995) abutment configuration.   When the bank height 
approaches zero, the scour pattern turns to be Type I scour, which is abutment scour in a 
rectangular channel.  In this case, no matter in what range the velocity ratio between the 
floodplain and the main channel is, the maximum scour will happen around the upstream  
corner of the abutment, because the approach flow obstructed by the protrusion of the 
abutment always makes contact with the bed around the abutment corner while it enters the 
bridge crossing. Therefore the downflow and secondary vortex will exert significant shear 
stress on the bed and cause scour. When the bank height increases, the flow coming from the 
floodplain must travel a distance before it hits the bed in the main channel after it enters the 
bridge crossing. In the process, the flow may avoid contacting the corner of the abutment or 
at least reduces the extent it otherwise does to the bed at the upstream corner of the abutment 
if the transverse horizontal distance the flow travels from the floodplain edge before it fully 
hits the bed in the main channel is greater than the horizontal distance from the floodplain 
edge to the corner of the abutment.   In Fig. 5-1 it was shown that when the velocity ratio 
between the floodplain and the main channel flow was relatively high, the floodplain flow 
came off the floodplain edge from a distance away upstream of the upstream corner of the 
abutment (Point E) and made full contact with the main channel bed at point B where the 
maximum scour hole was found.  However, In Fig. 5-2 it was shown the flow was fully 
constricted at the upstream corner of the abutment.      
 
5.1.2.5  Evolvement of Scour Holes 
 
Clear-water data of all runs indicated that the upstream scour holes (A and B in 
Figure 5-1 or A(B) in Figure 5-2) develop faster at the beginning of the experiment than the 
 
6
5- 
downstream scour holes (C in Figure 5-1 or Figure 5-2) because the strength of the vortex 
systems at the upstream corner of the abutment were generally stronger than those at the 
downstream end of the abutment.  Therefore, the upstream scour hole reaches equilibrium 
quicker than the downstream scour hole.  Depending on the height of the main channel bank 
and flow conditions, the depth of the downstream scour hole may or may not be greater than 
the scour depth at the upstream corner of the abutment.   Figures 5-4 and 5-5 show the 
evolution of the scour depths of both the upstream and downstream scour holes with time for 
Test B1 and B4, respectively.

5.2 Live-bed Scour Baseline Experiments  
 
When the velocity of the flow gets higher and the velocity ratio or the shear stress 
ratio of the flow exceeds one, then the bed materials of the river begin to move and bed forms 
are initiated. Under live-bed conditions in a certain range of velocity ratios, although it has 
been concluded that the local scour at the bridge abutment is less than what it is under critical 
condition (U/Uc = 1) provided that all other parameters are the same, it is believed that the 
fluctuating bed forms and the higher shear stress may pose more threat and challenge to the 
stability and practicability of the countermeasures. Therefore, live-bed experiments should be 
implemented to test those successful countermeasures in clear-water scour to confirm their 
efficiency in other river scour conditions. 
 
In order to study further the efficiency of those countermeasures tested in clear-water 
condition under live-bed conditions, the live-bed baseline, i.e., the scour depth at the bridge 
 
8
5- 
abutment without any countermeasures should be determined first as a reference.  The live-
bed baseline scour results were obtained under the flow conditions shown in Table 5-2.

In the live-bed condition, due to the wavy water surface and the fast moving and 
fluctuating bed forms, velocity profile measurements turned out to be difficult. Therefore, the 
flow was mainly controlled by the discharge and the average water surface profile and the 
average bed profile along a 12-m transect in the middle of the approach channel. First the 
discharge was set to be 1.5 times the discharge at the critical condition, and then the slope 
was adjusted until the average water surface slope and average bed surface slope are equal to 
the flume slope, i.e., the uniform live-bed flow condition through trial and error.  The flow 
depth was also adjusted to be 13.2-cm deep as it was in the clear-water case.   
 
Also, due to the fast change of the bed profiles at the bridge crossing, it is impractical 
to measure the bed profile as it was done in clear-water scour condition, which took 14 
transects and more than 13 minutes to cover the whole scour region as well as each point 
once. Therefore, in this case, only one 2.5 m long transect at the main channel side of the 
abutment was chosen to monitor the time evolution of the scour at the edge of the abutment. 
This transect starts from a point 1.5 m upstream of the upstream abutment tip and travels 
parallel to the flow just to the right of the abutment. Each loop of the transect takes 54.90 
seconds and a total of 133 loops is set to capture the local scour as well as the bed forms 
 
9
5- 
along this transect in a time range of 2 hours. The data obtained from this transect enables us 
to see where the maximum local scour takes place at the abutment and how it evolves with 
time.  
 
The bed form shape across the channel is far from uniform. Close to the opposite wall 
where these is no floodplain, the bed form amplitude is relatively small; close to the 
floodplain the amplitude of the bed forms is relatively greater than it is at the opposite wall.  
 
Figure 5-6 is a plot of the time-averaged local scour depth along the 2.5-m transect at 
the abutment versus distance starting from a point 1.5 m upstream of the upstream abutment 
corner for the 1.5 velocity ratio case. Figure 5-7 is a plot of the time evolution of baseline 
scour at the upstream abutment corner versus time after the scour reached equilibrium.   
 
From Figure 5-6 it can be seen that the maximum time-averaged local scour still took 
place at the upstream corner of the abutment with a scour depth of 7.23 cm. This agreed with 
the baseline scour pattern in the clear-water scour condition. The scour depth dropped to 4.01 
cm as it approached the downstream end of the abutment. Deposition began to occur at a 
point 45 cm downstream of the downstream abutment end.

From Figure 5-7 it is seen that the scour depth at the upstream abutment corner varied 
from near 0 to 14 cm with time. However, it varied about a mean value of 7.23 cm and had 
fluctuation amplitude of about 7 cm. The fluctuation was mainly due to the bed forms. When 
the crest of bed forms came, the scour depth reached its minimum value, which is a few 
millimeters above zero; when trough of bed forms came, the scour depth reached its 
maximum value. 
 
5.3 Conclusions  
 
Through these baseline experiments in a compound channel with various flow depths 
on the floodplain and main channel, various roughnesses on floodplain, and various bank 
heights, it was found that: 
 
 
 
Under clear-water conditions: 
 
1. Five locus of scour were found as shown in Fig. 5-1 in the whole scour region 
provided the roughness on the floodplain was the same as it was in the main channel 
and the velocity ratio between the floodplain flow and the main channel flow was 
relatively high.  The floodplain flow tended to shoot into the main channel at a 
distance away upstream from the upstream corner of the abutment instead of being 
fully constricted at the abutment corner. Under this condition, the maximum scour in 
the whole region was normally found in Zone B (Figure 5-1).   
2. The more the floodplain flow was constricted at the abutment, the greater the scour 
hole would be at the upstream corner of the abutment.  By increasing the roughness 
on the floodplain and decreasing the velocity ratio between the floodplain and the 
main channel the floodplain flow was able to be fully constricted around the corner of 
the abutment.   As a consequence, the scour zones A, B and E were incorporated 
together and the maximum scour depth was found at the upstream corner of the 
abutment.   
 
12
5- 
3. The principal vortex systems and secondary vortex systems at the upstream corner of 
the abutment were stronger than the wake vortex systems at the downstream corner of 
the abutment.  Consequently, the scour hole induced by the principal vortex systems 
and the secondary vortex systems reaches equilibrium quicker than the scour hole 
induced by the downstream wake vortex systems.  
4. Test B5 will be used as the clear-water baseline condition for following 
countermeasure experiments with a scour depth of 7.77 cm as a reference. 
 
Under live-bed conditions: 
1. Maximum scour took place at the upstream corner of the abutment. Time-averaged 
scour depth at the upstream corner is less than the scour depth under critical clear-
water condition, while instantaneous scour depths were between values near zero to 
values nearly twice the maximum scour under clear water flows because of the 
superposition of the trough of bed forms (Figure 5-7); 
2. Live-bed scour reaches equilibrium quicker than clear-water scour. 
Results in Table 5-2 will be used as the references to evaluate the efficiency of 
countermeasures that will be tested later.

CHAPTER 6. PARALLEL WALL AS AN ABUTMENT SCOUR 
COUNTERMEASURE 
 
6.1 Introduction 
 
Scour at an abutment can cause damage or failure of bridges and result in excessive 
repairs, loss of accessibility, or even death. Scour mitigation at bridges has received much 
attention in the past few decades.  Hydraulic countermeasures against bridge abutment scour 
can be classified as either river training structures or armoring countermeasures.  
Considerations in choosing the appropriate method of mitigation, other than design 
constraints, include maintenance and inspection requirements, enhancement of the physical 
environment, and constructability.  Design specifications for many of these scour mitigation 
techniques can be found in Hydraulic Engineering Circular 23 (Lagasse et al. 2001).  
 
Guide banks are earth or rock embankments placed at abutments to improve the flow 
alignment and move the local scour away from the embankment and bridge abutment.  The 
guide bank provides a smooth transition for flow on the flood plain to the main channel.  The 
major use of guide banks in the United States has been to prevent erosion by eddy action at 
bridge abutments or piers where concentrated flood flow traveling along the upstream side of 
an approach embankment enters the main flow at the bridge (Lagasse et al. 2001).  There also 
have been various studies on guide banks. Among those studies are Spring (1903), Karaki 
(1959, 1961) Neill (1973), Bradley (1978), Chitale (1980), Smith (1984), Richardson et al. 
(1984), and Lagasse et al., (2001). Guide bank orientation, length, crest height, shape and 
size, downstream extent and many other concerns are investigated.  Design guidelines for 
guide banks are given in Neil (1973), Bradley (1978), Ministry of Works and Development 
(1979), Central Board of Irrigation and Power (1989) and Lagasse et al. (1996, 1999, 2001).  
 
However, despite the design guidelines and studies in the literature, there are still 
issues remaining to be dealt with for certain types of bridges in certain environments.  For 
instance, for small county bridges where wing-wall abutments prevail and terminate on the 
riverbanks, specific design guidelines have not been developed.  Guide banks have been 
specifically designed for spill-through abutments on rivers with wide floodplains where the 
 
2
6- 
guide bank can be designed such that the slope of the guide bank is tangent to the slope of the 
abutment and there is no protrusion of the abutment into the flow beyond the slope of the 
guide bank.  However, in a wing-wall case, this point may not be achieved readily because of 
the vertical front faces of the abutments. In this situation either the slope of the guide bank 
protrudes out beyond the abutment face or the abutment face protrudes out beyond the guide 
bank slope.  The impacts of these configurations on local scour at abutments need to be 
studied.  Another issue is that a careful review of those guidelines (Bradley 1978) for 
determining the length of guide banks shows that they were designed for spill through 
abutments in wide floodplain rivers and they may not apply to smaller county bridges.  There 
are many gray areas that were not addressed and may be important for small county bridges.  
For instance, first, it is recommended that if the length read from the design chart is less than 
9.1m (30 ft), a guide bank is not needed.  This might not be true for a small two lane bridge 
whose width is about 9 m and a 9 m long guide bank may make a great difference in 
protecting the bridge abutments; second, it is recommended that for chart lengths from 9 m to 
30 m, a guide bank no less than 30 m long be constructed.  However, according to Herbich 
(1967), the length of the guide banks appear to be unimportant in reduction of velocities 
provided it is greater than a certain minimum length. Therefore, an unnecessarily long guide 
bank may increase the cost of the structure and not improve its effectiveness.  Yet another 
issue is that the parameters defined and used in determining the length of guide banks may 
not be easily available. For instance, the total stream discharge, Q, the lateral or floodplain 
flow discharge Qf and the discharge in the 100 feet of stream adjacent to the abutment, Q100 
(Bradley, 1978).  In addition, in spite of the fact that an elliptical-shaped end seems to be 
favorable by all design recommendations because the curved head can direct the flow 
smoothly into the main channel and reduce scour at the guide bank end, for small county 
rivers and streams whose floodplains are relatively narrow and are mostly farmlands under 
cultivation, the floodplain flow velocity may be relatively low and a curved head may not be 
justified. Most importantly, for those abutments terminating on the riverbanks, a curved end 
stretching out from the bank into the farmland may be aesthetically and practically not 
acceptable. This chapter deals with design issues for parallel walls on small rivers with 
wingwall abutments. These parallel walls are essentially scaled-down and simplified versions 
 
3
6- 
of guide banks.  This work fills a need for low-cost countermeasures for small bridges with 
wingwall abutments. 
 
6.2 Conceptual Model 
 
Figure 6-1 is a sketch of the conceptual model of parallel wall as countermeasure 
against abutment scour in a compound channel. A wall is attached at the upstream end of the 
abutment and is parallel to the flow direction. A wall thus installed is believed to have the 
following functions as conceptualized in the figure.  
 
First, it can push the scour inducing downflow and secondary vortex upstream away 
from the abutment so that that scour won’t be happening any more at the upstream corner of 
the abutment provided that the length of the wall is long enough; second, it can create a slow-
moving or dead water zone behind itself on the floodplain. In the case where there is no dead 
water zone, the return flow from the floodplain would flow along the roadway and bridge 
abutment embankment towards the main channel causing embankment scour. The presence 
of this wall and thus the dead water zone helps slow down the scour and erosion of the 
embankment; third, the wall helps straighten and improve the flow through the bridge 
crossing.  
 
Bearing this in mind, the wall length and different wall materials (solid, rock) will be 
tested as follows.

6.3 Results 
 
6.3.1 
Solid Parallel Wall 
 
A series of rectangular solid walls made from 13-mm thick plywood of different 
lengths, Ls, attached to the upstream end of the abutment and parallel to the flow direction 
were tested (Fig. 6-1). Solid walls are tested because in certain areas rocks may be not readily 
available and cost efficient. All the solid parallel walls were seated at the bottom of the bank 
slope and aligned with the abutment face parallel to the flume wall.  The top of each wall was 
the same height as the top of the abutment except in one clear-water case, in which the wall 
height was 5.2 cm lower than the water surface.  In these cases, the flow depth on the 
floodplain, yf, was equal to 5.2 cm and the flow depth in the main channel, ym, was 13.2 cm. 
The velocity ratio 
c
U
U /
was about 0.9, 1.5 and 2.3 in the center of the entire channel for each 
of the three flow conditions tested. Table 6-1 gives results of the solid wall experiments 
under clear-water conditions and Table 6-2 gives results under live-Bed conditions. Figure 6-

6.3.2 
Discussion of Solid Wall Length  
 
Fig. 6-3 is a plot of the maximum scour depths at the abutment and the maximum 
scour depth in the vicinity of the upstream end of the wall versus the length of the wall in 
terms of the abutment length, L, for both clear-water (U/Uc =0.9) and live-bed (U/Uc =1.5) 
experiments. It is seen that, as the length of the wall increases from 0.3L to 1.2L, the scour at 
the abutment decreases rapidly. There is no scour at the abutment corner in 4800 minutes of 
running when the wall reaches a length of 1.1L.

It is also seen from Fig. 6-3 that as the length of the wall increases from 0.6L to 1.5L, 
the scour at the abutment decreases rapidly for the live-bed case. The average scour depth at 
the abutment corner tends to zero if the wall length reaches a length of 1.6L. The amplitudes 
of the bed forms were significant, however. For instance the maximum trough depths of the 
bed forms in the approaching channel ranged from 9.32 to 11.50 cm. The presence of the 
solid wall did not affect the dune amplitudes as the bed forms migrated past the wall and 
abutment. This is why the instantaneous scour depth at the abutment fluctuates about its 
average value. From the live-bed experimental data it is seen that as the time-averaged scour 
depth at the bridge abutment changes from 5.05 cm (0.6L case) to 0.22 cm (1.5L case), the 
 
8
6- 
maximum contribution from the bed forms to the scour depth varies from 7.93 cm to 4.91 
cm. It can be seen that although increases in solid wall length decreased the amplitude of the 
bed forms, the decreases are not significant, which implies that if the height of bed forms 
constitutes a large part of the local instantaneous scour depth, it can only be completely 
eliminated when the presence of the solid wall happens to be able to change the flow 
condition in the bridge crossing into a transition regime under which the dunes completely 
disappear  and a flat bed with bed material transport is formed.  This transition regime may or 
may not be readily achieved depending on the approach flow conditions and the constriction 
ratio of the channel.  
 
It was also found from the live-bed experimental data with a velocity ratio of 2.3 that 
when the length of the wall was increased from 1.6L to 1.9L, the scour reduction rate at the 
abutment decreased from 70 percent to 53 percent instead of being increased.  This may be 
due to imperfect construction of the floodplain or wall, or it may be that these two scour 
values are within the range of scatter of the scour data for this high-sediment-transport flow.  
 
In summary, it was found that, in general, walls attached to the upstream end of the 
abutment were able to move the scour hole upstream from the abutment corner and therefore, 
were effective as a scour countermeasure. It was also found that, for clear-water scour 
conditions, as the length of the wall increased, the scour at the abutment declined. In live-bed 
experiments, however, when the length of the wall becomes longer than a certain length, the 
scour at the abutment begins to increase.

Parallel Rock Wall Experimental Results 
 
A series of rock walls of different lengths, Lw, and different protrusion lengths, Lp, 
were tested (Fig. 6-4) both under clear-water and live-bed conditions. This design was 
thought to be easier to construct in the field and less expensive than a solid wall.  In these 
experiments, the flow depth on the floodplain (yf ) was equal to 5.2 cm and the flow depth in 
the main channel (ym ) was 13.2 cm. The velocity ratio (
c
U
U /
) was 0.9 in the centerline of 
the entire channel for clear-water experiments and 1.5 and 2.3 for live-bed experiments, 
 
9
6- 
respectively.  The top of each wall was the same height as the top of the abutment so that 
they were not submerged by the flow. The experimental results are tabulated in Table 6-3 and 
Table 6-4.

From Tests 1(Fig. 6-5), 2, and 3 in Table 6-3 it was found that with a protrusion 
length of the wall base of 0.5W beyond the abutment face into the main channel, there tended 
to be a separation zone behind the downstream end of the wall, causing a significant local 
scour hole. When the length of the wall was 1.5L, the scour hole was relatively small (8.81 
cm) and did not pose a direct threat to the abutment.  However, when the length of the wall 
was 0.5L, the scour holes were 12.96 cm and the abutment was highly threatened. These 
scour holes could pose significant threat to a pier if a pier is located near the abutment.

From Tests 4 (Fig. 6-6), 5, and 6 (Table 6-3) it was found that with a protrusion of the 
wall base of 0.25W beyond the abutment face into the main channel, there was still a 
separation zone right behind the downstream end of each wall. However, the scour holes 
caused by the separation in the 0.25W protrusion cases were smaller than they were in the 
corresponding 0.5W tests. For instance, the scour hole depths were 4.30cm, 5.67cm and 8.04 
cm for 1.5L, 1L and 0.5L, respectively. However, these holes were closer to the abutment 
due to the reduced protrusion of the wall into the main channel.  These scour depths were at 
the downstream end of the rock wall, while the scour values presented in Table 6-3 were at 
the upstream abutment corner and, therefore, do not match.

From Tests 7 (Fig. 6-7), 8, 9, 10 and 11 in Table 6-3 it was found that when the wall 
base did not protrude beyond the abutment, separation that appeared in 0.25W and 0.5W 
protrusion cases disappeared.  However, the abutment now was partly protruding out beyond 
the wall slopes, causing constriction of the flow coming from the wall slope.  Fortunately, 
due to the high roughness of the wall slope, near-wall velocity of the flow being constricted 
was mitigated compared to the flow in the main channel and, therefore, the constriction of the 
flow did not cause significant scour at the abutment.  It was found that the scour depth at the 
abutment ranged from 1.9 cm to 2.0 cm when the length of the wall was from 0.5L to 2L. 
The scour depth was about 2.8 cm when the wall was 0.25L long, which indicated that for 
zero wall base protrusion, the scour depth at the upstream corner was not significantly 
affected by the length of the wall.

Discussion  
 
Fig. 6-8 is a plot of scour depth at the bridge abutment versus rock wall length for 
different wall protrusion lengths for clear-water experiments. It can be seen from the plot that 
for protrusion lengths, Lp, of 0.25W and 0.5W, increases of wall lengths can reduce scour at 
the abutment significantly. However, for the case of no protrusion, increases of wall lengths 
do not show obvious effects in reducing scour at the abutment except when the wall is less 
than 0.5 W.

Fig. 6-9 is a plot of the maximum scour depth caused by the wall in the channel

seen from this plot that for the 0.25W and 0.5W protrusion lengths, increases in wall lengths 
can significantly reduce the maximum scour depth that is induced by the presence of the 
walls. While for walls with protrusion length of zero, increases in wall length result in 
essentially no reduction in scour depth (i.e. scour at abutment) when wall lengths are greater 
than 0.5L.

Fig. 6-10 is a plot of both time-averaged and maximum instantaneous scour depth at 
the bridge abutment versus rock wall length for zero protrusion length under live-bed 
conditions. The time-averaged scour depth was calculated by measuring the scour depth at 
regular time intervals and then averaging over time.  It gives a sense of the average depth of 
scour.  The maximum instantaneous scour depth is the maximum scour measured at any time 
in the scour time series data collected.  Even though this maximum scour value would not 
 
17
6- 
persist at the abutment, it could perhaps cause some brief undermining of the abutment 
structure and, therefore, is reported here as a parameter of interest.  It is found that increases 
in wall lengths from 0.5L to 1.5L were able to reduce the time-averaged scour depth at the 
bridge abutment from 3.19 cm to 1.87 cm, which was about 41 percent. However, the 
increases in wall lengths only reduced the maximum instantaneous scour from 5.13 cm to 
4.73 cm, which was only about 8 percent.

bridge abutment versus rock wall length for zero protrusion under live-bed conditions, U/Uc 
= 1.5. 
 
In general it was found that (1) walls which were set back onto the floodplain such 
that the base of the walls were even with the abutment (protrusion length, Lp=0) were very 
 
18
6- 
effective in protecting the abutment,  (2) walls whose base protruded into the main channel 
beyond the abutment (protrusion length, Lp=0.25W or 0.5W) tended to produce significant 
scour in the bridge crossing and potentially threaten the middle and downstream abutment 
end while the length of these walls became shorter than a certain length, and (3) for zero 
protrusion length, Lp=0, the scour protection of the walls was not sensitive to the lengths of 
the wall unless it was less than 0.5L.  Below this length the degree of scour protection 
decreased.  
 
Regarding the amount of mass transfer or water flow through the rock wall itself, 
during the experiments, dye was injected in the floodplain side of the parallel walls. For all of 
the flow conditions investigated, no significant amount of dye was observed to flow through 
the rocks. This indicated that there is no significant flow transfer through the wall. In 
addition, an 0.8L long parallel solid wall with 85 circular holes with 8 mm diameter 
uniformly distributed on the wall was tried and compared with the 0.8L impermeable wall. 
The result was quite similar. This showed that when the permeability of the wall is smaller 
than a certain value, the solid wall acts like an impermeable one. 
   
 Cases of clear-water and live-bed scour were investigated.  It could be that during 
flow conditions in which there was less downstream velocity, that there is more flow through 
the wall.  This would most likely not be critical for scour, however, since clear-water and 
live-bed scour are the two worst cases for scour.  
 
In all of the experiments reported on here, there was no gap between the 
countermeasure and the abutment.  Care should be taken to ensure this, as a high-velocity jet 
may form if such a gap existed, that could exacerbate the scour depth in unknown ways.

6.4 Design of Parallel Wall for Scour Prevention at Wing-Wall Abutments 
 
Despite these limitations, general preliminary design guidelines can be established for 
the use of parallel solid walls and parallel rock walls to reduce scour at typical county bridges 
with wing-wall abutments terminating on or protruding a distance out beyond the main 
channel banks.  
 
6.4.1 Protrusion of Wall 
 
The best position for solid walls would be such that the solid wall’s face is aligned 
with the abutment’s face so that there is no protrusion by either structure.  
 
For parallel rock walls with lateral protrusions of 0.25W and 0.5W, a separation zone 
is formed behind the walls, causing scour holes and threatening the abutment foundation.  
Also the protrusion of the wall into the main channel further constricts the bridge crossing 
and reduces its conveyance capacity. Therefore, parallel rock walls of zero protrusion are 
recommended 
 
6.4.2 Length of Wall 
 
For a parallel solid wall countermeasure, the clear-water experimental results showed 
that a solid wall with a length of 1.1L will completely eliminate the local scour at the bridge 
abutment (Fig. 6); while with a velocity ratio of 1.5 a solid wall of length 1.6L will be able to 
reduce the time-averaged scour to zero; and for a velocity ratio of 2.3, a solid wall of length 
1.6L will reduce the time-averaged scour up to 70 percent. Further increases in the length of 
the wall will result in decreasing of scour reduction rate. Therefore, it is recommended that 
the length of the parallel solid wall be 1.6L.  
For the parallel rock walls of zero protrusion (Fig 6-9), a rock wall length of 0.5L is 
recommended.  
 
 
 
20
6- 
6.4.3 Height and Width of Wall Crest 
 
Heights for both solid wall and parallel rock wall should be at least as high as the 
bottom height of the lowest bridge deck so that flow can not enter the bridge crossing at the 
abutment even in the worst case scenario.  
 
The width of a solid wall depends on the construction material used.  It could be a 
several centimeters if a steel plate is used.  The width of a parallel rock wall crest need not be 
larger than one stone diameter. 
 
6.4.4 Slope of Wall and Apron  
 
The side slope of the rock wall must be less than the rock’s angle of repose to insure 
stability. However, the side slope should be as high as possible so that the protrusion of the 
abutment beyond the wall slope is the minimum.  It is recommended that the side slope of the 
wall be about 5 degree less than the angle of repose of the rocks. The slope at the upstream 
end of the wall can be much flatter than the side slope to help stabilize the end of the wall and 
reduce local scour there. Therefore, an end slope of 2~2.5:1(H:V) is preferred.  
 
Aprons are always needed at both the bottom of the side slope and the upstream end 
slope so that when scour takes place at those spots aprons can launch to prevent sliding of 
rocks from both slopes. Thickness, area limit and relative position with the parallel rock wall 
should be determined according to the scour depth and position of the scour hole along the 
wall. 
 
6.4.5 Comparison of Solid and Rock Parallel Walls 
 
If the best designs for both solid wall and rock wall are compared, it can be seen that 
the rock walls have advantages over the solid wall.  Table 6-5 shows scour depths for both 
solid and rock walls for both clear-water and live-bed scour conditions.  It can be seen that 
the rock wall allows less scour at the abutment than the solid wall.  The solid wall, therefore, 
seems to be feasible only when the cost of rocks is prohibitively high.

6.5 Conclusions 
 
1. 
A parallel solid wall attached at the upstream corner of the abutment 
parallel with the flow can be used as a countermeasure against abutment scour. The 
length of the solid wall should be 1.6L to obtain acceptable scour reduction rate at the 
abutment for the conditions tried in this study.  
2. 
A parallel solid wall attached at the upstream corner of the abutment 
parallel with the flow may or may not be able to reduce the amplitude of the bed 
forms that pass through the bridge opening depending on the changes of the flow 
parameters from the approaching channel after entering the bridge crossing.  
3. 
There may be significant scour at the upstream solid wall end, so no 
other structures should be located in this region.   
4. 
Parallel rock walls attached at the upstream of the abutment can also 
be used as countermeasures against scour at the abutment. The foot of the wall should 
not protrude into the main channel beyond the abutment and a top wall length of 0.5L 
will provide sufficient protection.  The side slope of the rock wall should be on the 
order of 30o but in no case should be steeper than about 70% of the rocks angle of 
repose. 
5. 
Rock walls have more advantages than solid walls in terms of 
efficiency, stability and cost etc.

CHAPTER 7. SPUR DIKE AS AN ABUTMENT SCOUR COUNTERMEASURE  
 
7.1 Introduction 
 
Scour at bridge crossings can cause damage or failure of bridges and result in 
excessive repairs, loss of accessibility, or even death.  Mitigation against scour at bridges has 
received much attention in the past few decades.  Hydraulic countermeasures against bridge 
abutment scour can be classified as river training structures and armoring countermeasures.  
Considerations in choosing the appropriate method of mitigation include maintenance and 
inspection requirements, enhancement of the physical environment, and construction 
methods needed other than design constraints.  Design specifications for many of these scour 
mitigation techniques can be found in Lagasse et al., 2001.  
 
Spur dikes, the focus of this paper, have been used extensively in all parts of the 
world as river training structures to enhance navigation, improve flood control, and protect 
erodible banks (Copeland, 1983).  Spur dikes are structures that project from the bank into 
the channel.  They may be classified based on their permeability: high permeability - retarder 
spur dykes; impermeable - deflector spur dikes; and intermediate permeability - as 
retarder/deflector (Brown, 1985).  They may be constructed out of a variety of materials 
including masonry, concrete, earth and rock, steel, timber sheet piling, gabions, timber 
fencing, or weighted brushwood fascines.   They may be designed to be submerged regularly 
by the flow or to be submerged only by the largest flow events.  
 
A spur dike serves one or more of the following functions.  
(1) 
Training of the stream flow.  For instance, spur dikes are commonly used to 
realign streams as they approach a bridge abutment.  A bridge abutment may be in 
danger of being severely eroded when it is subjected to high velocity flow from a 
channel that has changed course due to meandering.  
(2) 
 Protection of the stream bank (may or may not contain bridge abutments) 
from erosion.  
 
7-2
(3) 
Increasing of the flow depth for navigation (Garde et al., 1961) or 
improvement of aquatic habitat.   
 
In recent years, porous and overflow-type spur dikes have been shown to provide 
improved pool habitats for fish and other aquatic life in severely degraded streams (Shields et 
al., 1995). Volumes of the scour hole in the vicinity of model spur dikes were measured in a 
laboratory flume under clear-water overtopping flows with varying angles and contraction 
ratios to maintain bank protection and enhance aquatic habitats (Kuhnle et al.,1997, 1998 
,1999). In addition, because of the deposition induced by spur dikes, they may protect a 
stream bank more effectively and at less cost than revetments (Lagasse et al., 2001).  
 
  
 
Spur dikes constructed on or adjacent to an abutment to counter local scour have not 
been tried before to our knowledge.  This technique would constitute a combination of bank-
hardening and flow-altering to counter local scour.  By the proper placement of spur dikes 
around the abutment the flow can be redirected and scour near the abutment can be reduced.  
Local scour can threaten the spur dike itself, however (Fig. 7-1).   
 
The goals of this study was to determine the optimal length, spacing, number, and 
relative position of spur dikes using laboratory experiments with a wingwall abutment to 
manage scour in both clear-water and live-bed conditions. Design guidelines are presented.

7.2 Conceptual Model 
 
Figure 7-2 is a sketch of the conceptual model of a spur dike as a countermeasure 
against abutment scour in a compound channel. A spur dike is placed a certain distance away 
upstream of the abutment and is perpendicular to the flow direction. Flow on the floodplain 
can only go around the main channel end of the spur dike. A spur dike thus installed is 
expected to be able to block the floodplain flow from hitting the abutment face and direct the 
flow into the main channel. It may create wake vortices behind itself. The effects of these 
wake vortices and scour hole at the spur dike structure on the abutment scour should be 
evaluated experimentally to determine the best configuration of spur dikes as 
countermeasures. In the following experimental studies, number of spur dikes, distance 
between spur dikes and distance between spur dike and abutment, protrusion length, and 
construction material of spur dikes will be tested as parameters.

7.3 Results 
 
8.4.1 
Solid Spur Dikes 
 
 
A series of solid spur dikes made from 13-mm thick plywood were tested under the 
same flow condition as in the clear-water baseline test (U/Uc =0.9).  The flow depth in the 
main channel (ym) was 13.2 cm, and the flow depth in the floodplain (yf) was 5.2 cm.  Only 
one spur dike located upstream of the abutment was tested in each experiment. The variables 
experimented with for the solid spur dikes were length (Lsp), distances upstream of the 
abutment (Ds), and orientation angle with respect to the flow (θ ).  In all cases the top of the 
spur dikes was higher than the water surface.  The experimental results are listed below in 
Table 7-1.

The flow-perpendicular length of spur dike was found to be an important variable in 
protecting the abutment.  Flow-perpendicular lengths were restricted to the length of the 
abutment or less in this experimental series to prevent contraction of the flow in the main 
channel.  The six cases tested show that spur dikes of the same flow perpendicular length as 
the abutment do not protect it from scour regardless of spacing or orientation angle (Figs. 7-
3, 4 and 5).  When the spacing (Ds) of the spur dikes was less than the flow perpendicular 
length of the abutment (L), the upstream corner of the abutment will fall into the scour hole 
induced by the spur dike (Fig. 7-5).  When the spur dikes were far away (Ds ≥ 1.5L) from the 
 
7-6
abutment, a narrow channel formed between the deposited sand and the abutment corner 
(Fig. 7-4).  This caused scour at the upstream corner of the abutment.  In addition, the spur 
dikes caused the formation of huge scour holes which would undoubtedly threaten the 
stability of the stream bank and the stability of the spur dike itself. In summary, the effective 
reduction of local scour at bridge abutments using spur dikes requires that their flow-
perpendicular length be greater than the flow perpendicular length of the abutment.

7.3.2 Rock Spur Dike 
 
 
Four cases of rock spur dikes each with the same length perpendicular to the flow 
were tested under clear water flows.  These rock spur dikes were constructed from the flume 
wall extending out into the main channel perpendicular to the flow direction.  At the stream 
end of each spur dike there was a transverse slope of H:V=22/13.2.  Therefore, the top 
protrusion length of the spur dike was L (44 cm) and the bottom protrusion length was 1.5L 
(66 cm).  Each spur dike had a top width of 10 cm and a bottom width of 40 cm. The rocks 
were of 6.7 ~ 9.5 mm diameter. In these cases, the flow depth on the floodplain (yf) was 
equal to 5.2 cm and the flow depth in the main channel (ym) was 13.2 cm. The mean velocity 
ratio (U/Uc) was 0.9 in the middle of the main channel. The top of each spur dike was the 
same height as the top of the abutment.  The experimental data for rock wall spur dikes in 
clear-water scour conditions are summarized in Table 7-2.   
 
From the clear-water rock spur dike data (Figs. 7-6, 7, 8 and 9) it is seen that spur 
dikes with a top length of 1L and bottom length of 1.5L provided protection to the bridge 
abutment from scour.  These lengths are believed to be the minimum length required to be 
sufficient to protect the abutment.   
 
It was found from Tests Sp-8 (Fig. 7-7) and Sp-9 (Fig. 7-8) that as the distance 
between two successive spur dikes increased from 1L to 2L, the scour depth between the first 
two spur dikes increased from 7.62 cm to 13.14 cm, a more than 70 percent increase. 
Although this increase in scour depth did not pose a direct threat to the abutment, it did pose 
a threat to the two spur dikes and may cause these spur dikes to partially fail, therefore 
ultimately posing an indirect threat to the abutment.  From the scour condition between the 
second and the third spur dikes in these two tests, it was found that in Test Sp-8, the scour 
depth was 6.61 cm and greater than the scour depth in Test Sp-9.  However, the scour hole in 
Test Sp-8 was deflected out into the main channel by the spur dikes and had no effect on the 
abutment, while in Test Sp-9, the abutment was threatened.  Therefore, the best spacing 
between spur dikes is concluded to be 1L.

Generally the larger the number of spur dikes, the better the abutment will be 
protected, but at a higher cost.  To minimize the cost, the number of spur dikes should be 
minimized. With this in mind, Sp-10 (Fig. 7-9) was performed with only two end-slope spur 
 
7-12
dikes attached at the upstream and downstream corners of the abutment.  It was found that 
the two spur dikes thus located directed the flow away from the abutment thereby protecting 
the abutment and upstream and downstream banks.  
 
 
The advantage of these two end slopes are (1) they can direct the flow away from the 
abutment and protect the abutment, (2) they can provide extra stabilization to the abutment, 
especially when some rocks fill in the existing scour holes at both corners of the abutment, 
(3) as the scour in the bridge crossing develops both spur dikes sink and collapse to the 
original bed level and the rock material is distributed by the flow such that they are still able 
to function as riprap to protect the abutment, and (4) two spur dikes attached at the abutment 
face use less rock than spur dikes attached at the floodplain bank.  The disadvantage is that 
they may cause contraction scour. In relatively wide bridge crossings, this may not cause a 
significant problem, but may be a problem for narrower ones.  
 
Positioning of the spur dikes is important to the protection of the abutment.  As 
shown in the baseline case, the upstream corner of the abutment was the point that was most 
likely to scour.  Another scour-prone location would be the downstream end of the abutment 
where the flow leaves the bridge crossing and separates.  Therefore, spur dikes located at 
both ends of the abutment yielded the best results as shown in Test Sp-10.  The advantage of 
this configuration is that by being attached to the face of the abutment instead of the bank of 
the flood channel, the amount of rock material is minimized and the cost of the construction 
of the spur dikes reduced.  
 
From the clear-water experimental data, the configurations of Test Sp-8 and Sp-10 
were considered to have the most potential for protecting the abutment and were tested 
further under live-bed flows. No further experiments were conducted with the configurations 
used in Sp-7 or Sp-9. 
 
  
The same spur dike configurations used in Sp-8 and Sp-10 were tested under live bed 
conditions as countermeasures against scour at the abutment. Test Sp-11 had basically the 
same spur dike configuration as Case Sp-10.  Test Sp-12 had a similar spur dike 
 
7-13
configuration as Test Sp-11 except that there was initially a semicircular ring-shaped apron 
around each of the spur dike ends. Each apron had a width of about 20 cm and was about 3 
rock diameters thick.  Test Sp-13 and Test Sp-14 had similar spur dike configurations as Test 
Sp-10 except the aprons and rock size varied. There were similar aprons around the first two 
spur dikes in the later cases.  In these cases, the flow depths were the same as for the clear 
water experiments.  The velocity ratios (U/Uc) used were 1.5 and 2.3.  The rock sizes used 
for the velocity ratio of 1.5 were of 19 ~ 50 mm in diameter and for the 2.3 velocity ratio 
were 50 ~ 70 cm in diameter.  The top of each spur dike was approximately the same height 
as the top of the abutment.  The live-bed experimental data are listed in Table 7-3.

Data of Test Sp-11 (Fig. 7-10) showed that with a velocity ratio of 1.5, two dikes 
attached at both ends of the abutment were able to reduce scour over 100 percent (cause 
deposition).  Deposition of 1.0 to 4.0 cm occurred between the two slopes at the abutment 
during 3000 minutes of running time.  The maximum scour at these spur dikes happened at 
Point A where the foot of the upstream bank and the upstream side of the first spur dike 
meet.  This was different from the scour pattern in clear-water scour conditions.  Sediment 
moved along a scour zone starting from Point A and proceeded along the edge of the 
launched apron of the spur dikes towards Points B, C and D, covering part of these aprons 
and extending past the bridge crossing while keeping a distance from the abutment face.   
Therefore after equilibrium was reached, the deposition between the two slopes at the 
abutment was not affected any more.  Local scour holes were found at points C and D where 
flow separated between the two spur dikes.  The top of the two spur dikes was initially as 
high as the flow surface in Test Sp-11.  As the scour developed, the rocks on the slope of the 
spur dikes kept sliding into the scour hole causing the top of the two spur dikes to subside 
until the equilibrium state of the scour process was reached.  At the end of the test, the top of 
the first spur dike sank 7.50 cm and the top of the second spur dike sank 2.00 cm.  To reduce 
this sinking, Test Sp-12 was tested with two semicircular aprons of 20 cm width and 3 rock 
diameter thicknesses placed around the edge of each spur dike, respectively.  After 3000 
minutes of running time, the presence of the aprons helped improve the deposition between 
the two spur dikes at the abutment and reduced the scour depth at the upstream side of the 
first spur dike (Table 7-3).  However, the top of the first spur dike still sank 5.00 cm.

Although the configuration in Test Sp-11 and Sp-12 can protect the bed around the 
abutment, there is a concern about the portion of the floodplain at the upstream corner of the 
abutment.  For erodible floodplains the spur dikes thus placed are not able to protect the 
floodplain.  Compared to Test Sp-11 and Sp-12, data in both Table 7-3 and Fig. 7-11 showed 
that the configuration of Test Sp-13 can protect not only the channel bed around the 
abutment but also the floodplain and the abutment fill.  The minimum deposition of sediment 
around the abutment was found to be 2.66 cm.  Also because of the protection of the first 
spur dike, the spur dikes at both corners of the abutment experienced very little subsidence.

The same spur dike configuration as in Test Sp-13 was tried further in Test Sp-14 with a 
velocity ratio of 2.3.  The spur dikes were made of rocks with size of diameter of 50 ~ 70 mm 
in order to resist transport by the flow.  The spur dikes still performed protected the abutment 
from scour successfully (Table 7-3, Fig. 7-12).  
 
Fig. 7-12: Photograph of Sp-14 with three spur dikes. Flow from left to right. 
 
Rock spur dikes have more advantages than solid spur dikes.  First, unlike solid spur 
dikes that need foundations, rock spur dikes do not need a traditional foundation. Instead they 
 
7-17
can launch aprons around the structure edges as the scour holes develop and prevent them 
from failing.  Second, a sloped end at the main channel end of a spur dike whose top 
protrusion length is L will provide extra protrusion length and more deflection. Third, rock 
spur dikes may make deposition at the upstream of the abutment possible. The reason that the 
sediment did not deposit at the upstream corner of the abutment can be attributed to the fact 
that the abutment structure had a very smooth surface, and the flow velocity near the 
abutment surface was relatively high. This unimpeded velocity prevents settling of sediment. 
To conquer this problem, a pile of gravel placed at the upstream increases the roughness of 
the abutment and decreases the flow velocity so that sediment can deposit at the upstream 
corner of the piled rocks. Fourth, upward sloping rock spur dikes with relatively high friction 
roughness slow and guide the flow to climb up the slope instead of producing the scour-
inducing downflow. 
  
7.4 Design of Spur Dikes for Scour Prevention at Wing-wall Abutments 
 
From the experimental results, it was concluded that spur dikes with top protrusion 
length of 1L and bottom length of 1.5L were sufficiently long to provide protection to the 
bridge abutment.  The amount of material in the spur dikes can be greatly reduced if they are 
attached at the face of the abutment. The top length 1L is believed to be the minimum length 
required to protect the abutment while the bottom length is designed as a function of the 
rock’s angle of repose.   
It was concluded for straight channels that the best spacing 
between successive spur dikes was 1L.  A spacing of 1L or less was able to restrict the flow 
from full separation behind each spur dike.  As a consequence the scour depth behind each 
spur dike was less and the scour hole was pushed farther away from the spur dike end into 
the main channel.  
 
It was concluded that 3 spur dikes, with the first one located 1L distance upstream of 
the upstream abutment corner, and the remaining two attached at the upstream and 
downstream corners of the abutment, respectively, would be the best configuration for 
preventing scour of the bed near the abutment for this experimental setup (stream-wise width 
of abutment is around L).  For a bridge abutment whose stream-wise width is longer than 1L, 
 
7-18
a spur dike attached at the downstream end is recommended, with additional spur dikes 
located upstream at distances of 1L until the upstream corner of the abutment is met. One 
more spur dike is preferred upstream of the one at the upstream corner of the abutment. For a 
bridge abutment whose stream-wise width is less then the flow perpendicular length of the 
abutment (L), three spur dikes are recommended: one at the upstream corner of the abutment, 
one at a distance of 1L upstream of the abutment, and the other at 1L distance downstream of 
the abutment.   
 
 
In addition to the variables directly tested in the laboratory experiments described 
above, the following design guidelines are offered.  The top height of each spur dike should 
be high enough so that it is not overtopped by the flow during flooding, since all of the 
experiments described here are for emergent spur dikes and the flow patterns will be greatly 
altered if the spur dikes were overtopped.  The top width of the spur dikes should be wide 
enough to allow vehicle traffic, if needed.  The rock size of the spur dikes should be great 
enough to resist the flow stress in the worst flood situation.  It was observed in the laboratory 
that end slopes of spur dikes can be constructed as steep as possible since they are able to 
adjust themselves to a stable state as scour holes develop around them.  Semicircular aprons 
launch rocks into the scour hole during its development.   
 
7.5 Conclusions 
 
For the clear-water and live-bed scour and a Type III abutment configuration in a straight 
channel it can be concluded that: 
1. A single spur dike made of a solid plate having the same or shorter protrusion length 
as the abutment and placed upstream of the abutment was not able to protect the 
abutment. The downflow and the principal vortex are very strong at the stream end of 
the structure. As a consequence, a huge scour hole was always found at the end of the 
structure which threatened both the structure and the channel bank.  
2. Rock spur dikes show several advantages over rigid spur dikes and are preferred.   
3. Three rock spur dikes as configured in Tests Sp-9 and Sp-13 were considered the best 
configuration for protecting the abutment. This configuration can provide 100 percent 
 
7-19
protection to the abutment under the velocity ratios (U/Uc) of 0.9, 1.5, and 2.3.  Two 
spur dikes at the upstream and downstream corners of the abutment were also 
successful at preventing scour in both clear-water and live-bed experiments.

CHAPTER 8. BRIDGE ABUTMENT COLLAR AS A SCOUR COUNTERMEASURE 
 
9.1 Introduction 
 
Parallel walls and spur dikes have been previously tested as successful 
countermeasures against abutment scour in this study. A flow-altering countermeasure that 
has not previously been tested for abutments in a compound channel is a horizontal collar. 
Collars attached to piers have been studied as either an armor layer of the bed or a downflow-
halting device by Kapoor and Keana (1994) , Kumar et al. (1999), and Borghei et al. (2004).  
Collars block the downflow found at the leading edge of piers and abutments and eliminate 
scour-inducing secondary vortices. 
 
This chapter describes laboratory experiments with collars at a vertical-face wing-
wall abutment placed at the main channel edge, an abutment configuration typical of older 
bridges on smaller streams.  The authors are unaware of other studies of this type. 
 
8.2 Conceptual Model 
 
Figure 8-1 is a sketch of the conceptual model of a collar as a countermeasure against 
abutment scour in a compound channel. A collar is attached around the bridge abutment and 
has a certain areal covering extent of the bed. A collar thus installed is expected to be able to 
prevent the bed materials from being entrained by the return flow from the floodplain, the 
downflow and the secondary vortex systems.  In the following experimental studies, the areal 
extent in all directions and the vertical elevation of the collar will be studied under clear-
water conditions to determine the best configuration for collar to be a successful 
countermeasure.

against abutment scour in a compound channel. 
 
8.3 Collar Results 
 
A series of collars of different lengths and widths were attached to the bridge 
abutment under clear-water conditions as countermeasures against scour at the abutment. 
These collars were made from steel and were seated horizontally at the desired elevation.  
The flow depth on the floodplain, yf, was equal to 5.2 cm and the flow depth in the main 
channel, ym , was 13.2 cm. The velocity ratio, U/Uc was 0.9 at the center of the entire channel 
as in the baseline tests. Table 2 gives the dimensions of each collar configuration tested. 
 
Table 8-1 gives the results of the scour experiments with collars. Fig. 8-2 shows scour 
contours for equilibrium condition for Test T3.  It was found that the collars were able to 
protect the bridge abutment efficiently by isolating the return flow and the secondary vortices 
from the bed around the abutment that ordinarily would cause local scour.  The minimum 
collar dimensions that eliminated local scour were those with a width of 0.23L (L is the 
abutment length perpendicular to the flow direction) for elimination of local scour, a width of 
0.8L for maximum reduction of scour at the edge of the collar, and having the collar located 
at a vertical location of 0.08ym below the mean bed sediment elevation (ym is the main 
 
8-3
channel flow depth).  After removal of the collar, there was no scour observed under the 
collar around the abutment for any of the cases tested.

8.4 Discussion 
 
8.4.1 
Protrusion Width  
 
Figure 8-3 is a plot of the maximum scour depth at both the bridge abutment and at 
the main channel edge of the collar versus the transverse collar width for all collar cases 
when the collar elevation was 1 cm below the initial bed level. It can be seen from Figure 8-2 
that the maximum local scour depth under the main channel edge of the collar decreased 
from 7.10 cm to 1.00 cm as the width of the collar beyond the abutment increased from 10 
cm to 35 cm.   
 
Further examination of the experimental results shows that the maximum local scour 
depths at the main channel edge of each of these collars had a similar magnitude as the scour 
depth at the same location in the baseline case with no countermeasures.  Figure 8-4 is a plot 
of the transverse bed profile in the bridge crossing of the baseline case and the scour profile 
formed by the maximum local scour depth values under the edge of the various collars of 
different widths.  Fig. 8-4 suggests that the presence of the collar did

not change the strength of the vortex, but protected the abutment from scour by not 
allowing the scour-inducing secondary vortex to interact with the bed sediment.   
 
8.4.2 Collar Elevation 
 
To determine the optimal collar elevation, three different elevations of the collars 
were used in the experiments.  Figure 8-5 shows the scour depth at the abutment and at the 
edge of the collars versus collar elevation for collars with a width of 10 cm. It is evident that 
an elevation of 1 cm below the original bed level had the least scour.  This corresponds to an 
elevation of 1/13.2=0.08ym, where ym is the flow depth in the main channel.  The collar 
should be lower than the bed in order to keep the secondary vortex above it and not 
interacting with the bed sediment.

abutment face). 
 
8.4.3 Streamwise Collar Length  
 
At the upstream edge of the collar a shallow scour hole perpendicular to the flow was 
found in Tests T2 ~T4.  This scour hole started from the main channel bank and went 
transversely towards the opposite channel wall and was connected to the scour hole at the 
 
8-7
main channel edge of the collar.  This scour hole remained at the collar leading edge and, 
therefore, did not threaten the abutment.  In Tests T5 and T6, the upstream end of the collars 
was still buried in the sand at the end of the experiments and, therefore, no scour was found.  
The upstream end of the collar should be long enough such that the scour hole won’t threaten 
the abutment.  
 
There was always scour downstream of the trailing edge of the collar.  For Test T3 
and T4, the trailing edge of the collar ended in the middle of the bridge crossing and scour 
holes of more than 1.92 cm at the abutment were found in both cases.  These scour holes 
posed a threat to the middle of the abutment structure and may be eliminated simply by 
extending the trailing edge of the collar to a location that is downstream of the abutment 
structure (Figure 8-6).  The extension of the downstream collar length may increase scour 
magnitude.  This was observed in Tests T5 and T6 where the scour hole was more than 5 cm 
in Test T5 and more than 6 cm in Test T6. The scour location is not in the bridge crossing, 
however, and, therefore, should not correspond with a pier location.

collar width is 35 cm.  Collar elevation is 1 cm below the original bed. Flow from left to 
right.

8.4.4 Temporal Scour Variation 
 
It was observed that, unlike the rapid scour at the upstream and downstream abutment 
corners in the baseline case, the scour in the first ten hours under the main channel edge of 
the collar was very slow in all collar cases.  Figure 8-7 is a plot of the temporal evolution of 
scour under the edge of the plate in Test T3.  This delayed scour constitutes another 
advantage of using the abutment collars.

8.5 Conclusions 
 
From these clear-water experimental data, it can be concluded that: 
1. 
Collars were found to be effective at preventing local scour at vertical wall 
bridge abutments.  The collars isolated the turbulent flow and vortex systems from the bed 
material and therefore prevented the bed underneath the collar from scouring.   
2. 
The further the collar extended downstream of the abutment, the farther 
downstream the scour hole was located.  As the transverse width of the collars increased, the 
 
8-9
depth of the scour hole at the edge of the collar decreased.  The scour became insignificant as 
the main channel edge of the collar was extended beyond the local scour hole area measured 
in the baseline case without countermeasures.  The trailing edge of the collar should extend 
to a location downstream of the abutment. 
3. 
Based on these experiments the collar elevation should be 0.08ym below the 
original bed level and the collar width should be at least 0.23L, where L is the abutment 
length perpendicular to the flow direction.

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY 
 
9.1 Summary 
 
Scour at bridge abutments can cause damage or failure of bridges and result in 
excessive repairs, loss of accessibility, or even death.  To mitigate abutment scour, both 
clear-water and live-bed laboratory experiments in a compound channel were performed 
using parallel walls and spur dikes. In addition, collars were also tested under clear-water 
conditions only.  
 
Two types of parallel walls were tested: the first type was made of a wood plate and 
the second was made of piled rocks. For solid parallel walls, a series of rectangular straight 
plates of different length attached to the upstream end of a wing wall abutment parallel to the 
flow direction were employed.  The velocity of the flow for the three cases was either 0.9, 
1.5 or 2.3 times the incipient motion velocity for bed sediment movement. The bed material 
was sand with a mean diameter of 0.8 mm and a standard deviation of 1.37. All the plates 
were seated at the bottom of the compound channel bank slope and were even with the 
abutment face.  
 
It was found that straight plates thus situated caused the scour hole to be shifted away 
from the upstream corner of the abutment and to be effective as a countermeasure to prevent 
scour there. As the length of the plate increased, the scour at the abutment declined. It was 
found that a length of 1.6L, with L being the length of the abutment perpendicular to the 
flow, caused the scour to be eliminated at the abutment for a velocity ratio (U/Uc) of 0.9 
(clear-water scour).  Similarly, a 1.6L long wall can eliminate the time-averaged scour depth 
at the abutment 100 percent for a velocity ratio of 1.5, and 70 percent for a velocity ratio of 
2.3. If the upstream end of the wall is anchored below the scour depth, this countermeasure 
can be feasible for situations where rock is expensive. 
 
For parallel rock walls, various values of wall length and protrusion length into the 
main channel were tested.  It was found that a wall that does not protrude into the main 
 
9-2
channel with a length of 0.5L minimizes scour at the abutment for all three different flow 
velocity ratios (0.9, 1.5, and 2.3). 
 
Experiments using spur dikes as a countermeasure against local scour at wingwall 
abutments were made in a laboratory flume channel.  Flow velocity ratios of 0.9, 1.5 and 2.3 
times the incipient motion of the bed material sediment were used in a compound channel 
with a model abutment.  The bed material was sand with a median diameter of 0.8 mm and a 
standard deviation of 1.37. A series of configurations of spur dikes with varying lengths, 
spacings, number, and positions with respect to the abutment were tested.  The most effective 
configuration to prevent local scour at the abutments consisted of three spur dikes composed 
of rock located upstream of the abutment and at the two corners. 
 
To mitigate abutment scour, flat, horizontal, steel collars were attached around a 
wing-wall abutment ending at the main channel edge under clear-water flow conditions in a 
laboratory flume channel. It was found that these collars were able to protect the bridge 
abutment efficiently by eliminating secondary vortices that ordinarily would cause local 
scour.  The minimum collar dimensions that eliminated local scour were a flow perpendicular 
width of 0.23 L (L is the abutment length perpendicular to the flow direction) and a flow 
parallel length of 0.7 times the flow parallel abutment width.  It was determined that a 
vertical location of 0.08 ym (where ym is the main channel flow depth) below the mean bed 
sediment elevation gave the best results of scour reduction.  In addition, the collar not only 
reduced scour magnitude near the abutment, but also retarded the development of the scour 
hole. 
 
9.2 Limitations of Study 
 
There are some limitations about this study. For instance, the length of the abutment 
was fixed, so were the floodplain width and the contraction ratio of the channel at the bridge 
crossing. If the floodplain width increases, there could be more returning floodplain flow and 
cause more scour at the parallel wall and the abutment. Also, the highest velocity ratio tried 
herein is 2.3. This ratio could be higher in the real field during storm events. Solid walls with 
 
9-3
length of equal or more than 1.9L could be tested further. The rigid floodplain could also be a 
limitation because in the real situations floodplains are generally erodible. The results here 
assume that the channel embankment does not erode.  This corresponds to the case of 
cohesive channel banks, which is not uncommon.  However, this should not have a major 
effect since the safety of the walls is not dependent on the floodplain. Since these results 
were obtained from the experiments at a greatly reduced scale, extrapolating to full-scale 
conditions could cause distortions. The velocity ratio (U/Uc), a commonly used similarity 
control variable in all hydraulic experiments balancing the hydraulic forces with the sediment 
resisting forces, was used to control the similarity of the experiments.  In addition, bed forms 
typical of natural rivers were observed throughout the experiments.  This does not guarantee, 
however, that there will not be differences between the laboratory and field results due to 
differences in scaling of the turbulent eddies and vortices formed.  Scour produced at a small 
scale is usually more severe than that in the filed, however, making the results of the lab 
study conservative. 
 
 
9.3 Future Work 
 
The design guidelines offered here for each countermeasure are developed under 
limited laboratory conditions. More work can follow after this study. For instance, it would 
be necessary to test the effect of roughness on the floodplain on the scour depth at the 
abutment. Channel setup with erodible floodplain, non-uniform sediments will make the 
experiments more realistic. Different abutment orientations, length, shapes, and 
configurations with higher flow velocity ratios can be tested. 
 
Effect of permeability of rock structures on their own stability and protection 
efficiencies can be studied. Collars as countermeasures against abutment scour under live-bed 
conditions are difficult to test since it is hard to monitor and measure the scour depth under 
the collar around the abutment. However, it should be tested for the integrity of the study. 
Also, methods of how to attach a collar to a bridge abutment should also be studied to make 
this collar as practical as other countermeasures.  
 
 
9-4
A 3-D numerical model can be employed to simulate the flow patterns around these 
countermeasures to have a better understanding of how these structures work and to facilitate 
design.
