Southeastern New Mexico Farmer’s Irrigation 
Water Management Program 
A Sandia National Laboratories Small Business Assistance Project 
 
Introduction 
In many parts of New Mexico, as well as the arid western U.S., it is becoming apparent that water conservation 
measures are needed to offset water loss due to drought and the increased demand of population growth.  Water 
conservation programs are being implemented in domestic, industrial, and agricultural arenas to increase overall 
irrigation efficiencies by monitoring soil moisture infiltration, storage and depletion.  In doing so, numerous complex 
interactions between: 1) surface, vadose, and ground water, 2) climate, 3) soil characteristics and textures, 4) plant 
physiology, and 5) intrinsic economic constraints can be positively correlated and better understood.

Need 
Monitoring soil moisture accumulation and migration is an extremely important irrigation procedure used to determine 
the optimal irrigation application schedule for individual soil textures and crop varieties, as well as the proper volumes 
of delivered water needed to maintain field capacity saturation levels within the crops’ root zones (a function of growth 
season and crop maturity).  Newly implemented irrigation techniques and practices will increase forage yields and 
ultimately save precious water.  Optimizing crop production by understanding relationships that exist between water 
consumption, nutrient uptake, and lengths of seasonal growth to maturation, among others, is an ongoing economic 
concern to irrigators in southeastern New Mexico. 
 
Objectives 
Irrigators require a tool or a method that will allow them to optimize irrigation efficiency and crop yield, while at the 
same time minimizing water consumption.  Sandia National Laboratories, in conjunction with the New Mexico State 
University’s Agricultural Science Center (NMSU-ASC), is providing assistance to irrigators here in southeastern New 
Mexico by accurately tracking and correlating the evolution of soil moisture properties, hydrodynamic processes, plant 
physiologies, water quality and availability issues, as well as daily meteorologic conditions.  This work will aid in 
developing and correlating the complex relationships between: 1) textural and constitutive pedogenic properties, 2) soil 
moisture infiltration, percolation, and depletion rates, 3) plant physiology and evapotranspiration rates, 4) daily 
climatic and meteorologic conditions, 5) hydrodynamic processes, and 6) water availability, quality, storage, and usage 
concerns.

Existing Research 
Sandia and the NMSU-ASC have installed soil moisture probes, soil matric potential probes, divining probes, data 
loggers, relative humidity sensors, evapotranspiration gages and rain gages to a variety of agricultural fields supporting 
annual yield crops including: 1) alfalfa, 2) gramagrass, 3) fescue, 4) tall wheatgrass, 5) green chile, 6) pima cotton,  
7) acala cotton, 8) field corn, 9) giant sunflowers, 10) sorghum, and 11) milo.  Together we are working to positively 
correlate the complex interrelationships between surface and ground water quality and availability, meteorological 
conditions, soil characteristics and textures, plant physiologies and various site-specific economic constraints to 
maximize the efficiency of agricultural irrigation methods in southeastern New Mexico.  The technologies developed 
by this study will not only have a positive impact on the western states of the U.S., but also in arid climates worldwide.

(B) the soil matric potential (measured using Watermark soil matric potential probes) of the sandy loam supporting the 
Bench 3 fescue pasture.  Side-roll irrigation of Bench 3 occurred on June 30, as seen in the peak of plot (A) and within the 
trough of plot (B).  Plot (C) shows the cumulative measured evapotranspiration rate of Bench 3 fescue collected between 
the months of December 2003 and July 2004.
