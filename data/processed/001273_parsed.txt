BOREAS RSS-4 1994 Southern Study Area Jack Pine LAI and FPAR
Data
Stephen Plummer
Summary
The RSS-4 team collected several data sets related to leaf, plant, and stand physical, optical, and
chemical properties. This data set contains leaf area indices and FPAR measurements that were taken at
the three conifer sites in the BOREAS SSA during August 1993 and at the jack pine tower flux and a
subset of auxiliary sites during July and August 1994. The measurements were made with LAI-2000
and Ceptometer instruments. The measurements were taken for the purpose of model parameterization
and to test empirical relationships that were hypothesized between biophysical parameters and remotely
sensed data. The data are stored in tabular ASCII files.

1. Data Set Overview
1.1 Data Set Identification
      BOREAS RSS-04 1994 Southern Study Area Jack Pine LAI and FPAR Data 
1.2 Data Set Introduction
      Estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR)
were made during the Focused Field Campaign in summer 1993 (FFC-93) and the second Intensive
Field Campaign (IFC-2) in 1994. In FFC-93, preliminary measurements were made using a LI-COR
LAI-2000 and a Decagon Devices Ceptometer at the three conifer tower flux sites Young Jack Pine
(YJP), Old Jack Pine (OJP), and Old Black Spruce (OBS) in the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere
Study (BOREAS) Southern Study Area (SSA), while in 1994 attention was focused on jack pine
tower flux and auxiliary sites in the SSA. LAI was estimated using both instruments; FPAR was
obtained using the Ceptometer. Both the Ceptometer and the LAI-2000 rely on the relationships
Page 1
between radiation transmission, canopy gap fraction, and LAI. The assumptions of these approaches
are summarized below (see Section 9) and have been assessed for the BOREAS sites in Chen et al.
(1997). 
1.3 Objective/Purpose
      The Remote Sensing Science (RSS)-04 investigations were designed to obtain LAI, FPAR, and
foliar chemistry data for a complex spatially variable forest canopy in order to: 
•
Parameterize an ecosystem simulation model. 
•
Test empirical relationships hypothesized between biophysical parameters and remotely
sensed data. 
•
Parameterize a forest reflectance model and compare it with Airborne Visible and Infrared
Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data to deduce whether observed 'relationships' between
canopy chemistry and reflectance are a product of canopy structure rather than foliar chemical
variations themselves (see references list and biochemistry data set). 
•
Drive the ecosystem simulation model with estimates of LAI and chemistry derived from
remotely sensed data. 
1.4 Summary of Parameters

1.5 Discussion
      The measurements that comprise this data set were collected as a contribution to the determination
of the biophysical characteristics of the BOREAS SSA.

3. Theory of Measurements
For a discussion of the theory behind measurements presented here, users are directed to the review by
Welles (1990), Welles and Norman (1991), and Chen et al. (1997). 
4. Equipment
4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description
i) LAI
      Two instruments were used to estimate LAI: a LI-COR LAI-2000 leaf area meter and a Decagon
Devices Ceptometer. The LAI-2000 uses either one or two sensors to make measurements of the
incoming diffuse incident flux above (A) and below (B) the canopy in blue wavelengths (<490 nm).
Each reading comprises measurements of the amount of radiation at five zenith angles simultaneously
over either the full azimuth or some portion of it, dictated by a viewing mask attached to the optical
head. One measurement comprise a minimum of 10 numbers corresponding to 5 values of A (above)
and 5 of B (below), at zenith angles of 0, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5, and 67.5 degrees. The Ceptometer is a
line quantum sensor consisting of 80 separate photodiodes spaced at 1-cm intervals that are sensitive to
radiation in the PAR region (400-700 nm). Measurements above and below the canopy are made to
determine canopy transmittance at a number of solar zenith angles. 
ii) FPAR
      The Ceptometer was also used to determine the fraction of PAR absorbed by the canopy at a
number of solar zenith angles. 
4.1.1 Collection Environment
      Measurements were collected during ambient surface atmospheric conditions at the SSA during
August 1993 (FFC-93) and July to August 1994 (IFC-2). The LAI-2000 measurements were made at
dusk and dawn, Ceptometer data were collected on sunny days. 
4.1.2 Source/Platform
      The instruments were held by the human investigators. 
4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives
      The objective was to collect LAI and FPAR measurements at various locations. 
4.1.4 Key Variables
      LAI, FPAR, Mean Tip Angle 
Page 3
4.1.5 Principles of Operation
      The LAI-2000 and Ceptometer are instruments that make measurements of the incoming radiation
below a plant canopy. In the case of the LAI-2000, measurements are made in the blue (<490 nm)
region, while the Ceptometer records incoming radiation in the PAR (400-700 nm) region. These data
can be used to estimate LAI indirectly by making assumptions about the canopy architecture (leaf
distribution). LAI is derived by inverting the radiation transmission (or gap fraction) information. The
gap fraction is the fraction of view in any direction from below a plant canopy that is not blocked (by
leaves). If it is assumed that leaves are the only elements that block radiation, that they are
nontransmitting, and that they are randomly distributed in space, then the transmission of a beam of
radiation can be related to the mean foliage density (see Section 9 for equations). If the canopy is
horizontally homogenous, then the mean foliage density can be related to LAI.
      The LAI-2000 can be considered to be analogous to hemispherical photography in that it uses a
fish eye light sensor that measures diffuse radiation in five distinct angular bands about zenith. The
incoming radiation is projected onto photodiodes arranged as concentric rings. To derive gap fraction
information, light conditions are assumed diffuse and uniform (dusk, dawn, or overcast conditions),
and measurements are made of the sky above the canopy followed by readings below the canopy. The
ratio of above-to-below canopy readings is used to obtain gap fraction. Because foliage is not normally
randomly distributed and there is a proportion of nonfoliage matter that blocks radiation (dead leaves,
branches, stems, or trunks), the derived measurement is normally referred to as "effective" LAI.
Correction of these measurements can be made by derivation of factors that represent the
woody-to-total area ratio and the clumping factors (needle-to-shoot area ratio and foliage clumping at
greater than shoot level).
      The Ceptometer measures PAR radiation using 80 photodiodes spaced at each centimeter along an
80-cm rod. These are used to provide an average value of PAR over the 80-cm length and for the
specific solar zenith angle and relative azimuth. To account for azimuthal variation in foliage
distribution, it is advisable to use the average over several azimuth directions (in this case, eight).
Because the instrument is primarily used to measure the fraction of absorbed PAR (FPAR),
measurements are taken in direct sun conditions, with the proviso that the solar illumination is
consistent over the period of measurement. In the same way as with the LAI-2000, measurements are
obtained first outside the canopy and subsequently below the canopy. In line with gap fraction
measurements, these can be converted into an estimate of LAI using the approach of Norman (1988)
(see Section 9). This also requires measurement of the ratio of diffuse-direct incident radiation. The
diffuse component can be obtained by shading the Ceptometer from direct sun using an appropriately
sized object such that the entire length of instrument is covered for the width of the solar disk (this is
an acquired skill). More recent instruments (Delta-T SunScanô) come with a separate quantum sensor
and shading ring for use with a line PAR sensor. Chen et al. (1997) indicate that the Ceptometer
provides a measurement of plant area index, although the finite averaging does account for error
caused by clumping at scales larger than the averaging length. 
4.1.6 Instrument Measurement Geometry
LAI-2000
      The LAI-2000 is simple to operate and acquires data relatively fast. Operation can be through
single-head, dual-head, or remote-head modes. In single-head mode, as used in this experiment, both
A (above) and B (below) measurements are made with the same optical head. Because the calculation
is made by comparison of A and B measurements, the instrument does not require either absolute or
relative calibration. However, there is a need for ready access to a clear sky view near to the
measurement site. In BOREAS operation, this caused difficulties, especially at mature pine sites with
tree heights of approximately 15 m. Measurements had to be tailored to site conditions, and given the
need to cover as many sites as possible, operation often occurred in nonoptimal conditions. Sites were
measured at dawn or dusk, although the distance between sites limited coverage on any given day. For
short tree sites, e.g., SSA-YJP, it was possible to get above the canopy (using the back of a standard
Jeep or by climbing the flux tower in periods of nonoperation (1993) to a height of approx. 3-4 m).
The LAI-2000 head requires leveling, but it contains a bubble level to make leveling easier. The best
Page 4
practice is to maintain instrument orientation for all measurements (A and B). This is particularly
important where the availability of a clear area is restricted to a logging road. In such cases, the A
reading was made from the back of a Jeep with the optical head masked downward such that only a
proportion of the view was used (see Section 5). In all cases, the optical head was masked for the
observer using a 45-degree mask unless more was required. A measurements were made as regularly
as possible (before and after single B runs) to minimize the effect of variation in sky conditions and
linear interpolation used to provide A values for each B value. Repetitions of each measurement were
made to increase the representativeness, and in cases where the B value exceeded a corresponding A
the data point was ignored. This usually applied to measurements from the fifth ring. Removal of the
fifth ring measurement in software meant that the data could be reintroduced. In all cases, the
measurements were made at the same height, 1 m above the ground, except for reference
measurements. The latter were made 1 m above the canopy (F8L6T), from the top of a large flux tower
(G2L3T), or from a Jeep + 1 m height. 
Ceptometer
      As with the LAI-2000, there are a number of issues that affect the representativeness of
measurements made with the Ceptometer. In all cases, reference measurements were made at the same
locations as for the LAI-2000, and all measurement runs started and finished with a reference
measurement. Since the same set of measurements was used for FPAR and LAI, these measurements
were all made under direct sun conditions and included diffuse incident, canopy, and understory
measurements. Each measurement comprised eight azimuth directions with the instrument level and out
of any shadow cast by the operator. The eight measurements were made at the cardinal and subcardinal
directions. Measurements were made at approximately 1 m where significant understory existed or 30
cm above ground where the understory was moss/lichen. Experience dictated whether a particular set
of measurements was acceptable, especially for diffuse measurements, which required shading of the
80 photodiodes. It should be noted that because each individual measurement (1 through 8) was
averaged "on the fly," one unshaded diffuse measurement could bias the data. When this occurred,
measurements were repeated. A measurement sequence took considerably longer than the equivalent
LAI-2000, and the processing was more laborious because no software was written for this purpose.
This is now available with the Delta-T Sunscanô and may be available with the Decagon Accuparô.

4.2 Calibration
i) LAI-2000
      Sensor calibration consists of five multipliers for the outputs of the five rings of the detector. These
values are supplied on a calibration sheet and relate one ring to another. The values do not convert
outputs to absolute values of energy. In one-sensor mode, this is unimportant because the same sensor
makes both A and B measurements. In two-sensor mode, the two sensors are compared under the
same diffuse light conditions to adjust the sensitivity of the two sensors. The instrument is calibrated
using an integrating sphere supplied by the UK representatives of LI-COR, Inc., Glen Spectra Ltd. 
ii) Ceptometer
      For LAI and FPAR determination, as long as the relative calibration of the 80 sensors is consistent,
the same method applies as above. However, for determination of PAR, absorbed PAR (APAR), or
incident PAR (PAR0), calibration must be applied to convert from output to SI units (µmol/m2/s).
Calibration is checked regularly by the owners of the instrument, University of Wales, Swansea, by
comparison against an accurate PAR sensor under a standard daylight lamp. The accurate PAR
quantum sensor is traceable to UK national standards. 
4.2.1 Specifications
      Ceptometer - The ideal spectral response for a quantum sensor is a "top hat" function with 100%
dropoff at 400 nm and 700 nm. All quantum sensors approximate this; however, errors caused by
imperfect spectral response are small for daylight conditions. The system cosine response matches the
ideal accurately (>90% below 70 degrees). Individual Ceptometer measurement time is nominally 120
ms over a range of 2500 µmol/m2/s with a resolution of 0.3 µmol/m2/s. Accuracy of the instrument is
±10%. Maximum recorded values were approximately 1,500 µmol/m2/s.
      The LAI-2000 measurements were made in one-sensor mode because calculation is based on the
ratio of A to B measurements. Issues of calibration, resolution, and accuracy are not a problem
provided that the relative calibration between individual view rings is accurate and consistent. 
4.2.1.1 Tolerance
      Ceptometer - Accuracy of the instrument is ±10%. Maximum recorded values were approximately
1,500 µmol/m2/s, well within the stated instrument range. Comparison of Ceptometer measurements
against the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument indicated a discrepancy
of approximately 200 counts, but this was consistent over a range of light conditions. Absolute values
of PAR were therefore not reported. Error analysis for the FPAR measurements could not be
conducted against those from other Principal Investigators (PIs) (Chen, RSS-07) because
measurements were not coincident. Within canopy variability (n=10) indicates that for FPAR values
greater than 0.7, an error of ±10% should be expected, but because of clumping this can rise to
20-30% for FPAR values of 0.5.
      The LAI estimates from the Ceptometer, LAI-2000, TRAC, and allometry were assessed by Chen
et al. (1997). All the methods have limitations, and an absolute accuracy could not be attributed to any
one method. The error range for LAI measurement method is on the order of 15-30%. 
4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration
      See Section 4 comments above - all measurements are ratio values, and the only issue is sensitivity
of the instrument across the measurement range. This has not been checked but is assumed to be
acceptable. Intercalibration between instruments was not performed for the LAI-2000 because it was
used in one-sensor mode. Comparison of Ceptometer measurements against the TRAC instrument
indicated a discrepancy of approximately 200 counts, but this was consistent over a range of light
conditions. Absolute values of PAR are not provided in this data set. 
4.2.3 Other Calibration Information
      None given.

5. Data Acquisition Methods
1993 Procedure: 
i) LAI using the LAI-2000
      At each of the three conifer tower flux sites, 100-m transects were established with access to a
nonforest area for determination of radiation flux. 
      At the SSA-YJP site, four transects were laid out on the cardinal points centered on the road next to
the site hut (see accompanying .gif file). Data acquisition comprised an A measurement followed by 10
B measurements for each transect and finished with additional A measurement. A samples were taken
at the flux tower and B samples at 10-m intervals along each transect. Data were collected on
14-Aug-1993 at 08:00 local time (15:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). All the A measurements were
acquired above the canopy at 3-4 m using the steps on the flux tower. In all cases, a 45-degree view
cap was used to eliminate the observer. 
Page 7
      At the SSA-OJP site, suitable access to a clear area at the flux tower site to make irradiance
measurements was not available. Therefore, a similar stand adjacent to the site access road near a small
lake (see accompanying .gif file) was selected. Irradiance measurements were taken at the lake edge
using a 180-degree view cap. Four transects were established; however, the restricted size of the stand
required a reorientation of these transects at some point along the 100-m length. Data were acquired on
16-Aug-1993 at 05:20 (12:20 GMT) and 06:30 (13:30 GMT). 
Page 8
      Similarly, in the SSA-OBS, reasonable access to the flux tower site in 1993 was unavailable and
there was no access above the canopy. Transects were therefore established nearer the road, and the
road served as the irradiance site with a 315-degree view cap. A transect was established in each of the
two main strata types, tall, high LAI black spruce, and short, low LAI black spruce. Data were
acquired every 5 meters to give a sample size of 20 for each transect. Data were recorded on
25-Aug-1993 at 13:30 (20:30 GMT).
      LAI was calculated using options available in the LAI-2000 processing software. Four different
methods were used: standard, slope/intercept (Lang, 1987), ellipsoidal leaf distribution (Campbell,
1986), and constrained least squares (Norman and Campbell, 1989). 
ii) LAI using the Ceptometer
      At the same sites as in i), measurements were made several times per day. Each measurement on a
transect was the average of eight azimuthal measurements of PAR flux. Total and diffuse incident flux
were measured before and after each transect using a shade to block the sun. Similarly, at the first and
last transect point, diffuse within-canopy flux and PAR reflected by the understory were measured.
LAI was determined empirically using the method described by Norman (1988) with the beam fraction
determined by interpolation for each transect point (see Section 9). 
iii) FPAR
      The measurements described above for the Ceptometer were also used to calculate the variation in
FPAR for each transect using measurements of canopy transmission and interpolated values of incident
flux and soil reflected flux. The canopy reflected flux was calculated using an average of eight
measurements of a short roadside tree. FPAR was calculated for three solar zenith angles and for two
transects at each site. 
Page 9
1994 Procedure: 
i) LAI with the LAI-2000
      The data acquisition in 1994 concentrated on the jack pine tower and auxiliary sites in the SSA and
covered the same transects/plots as those laid out by RSS-07 and Terrestrial Ecology (TE)-23 for
allometric measurements. For each auxiliary site, this comprised two perpendicular 50-m transects
oriented in due S-N and E-W directions. Deviation from such an arrangement is explained in Section
6.
      A total of nine jack pine sites were sampled with the LAI-2000. In all cases, the data were acquired
either before sunrise or after sunset and with a large view cap (315 or 330 degrees) because the only
irradiance site in most cases was the access road. Tree edge effects were reduced by measuring
irradiance from the top of a Jeep. 
ii) LAI with the Ceptometer
      Ceptometer data were acquired at the same sites as the LAI-2000 using the method described above
for 1994 site locations. Ten sites were covered, with runs recorded at three solar zenith angles for
seven of the sites and two solar zenith angles for the other three sites. In addition, a series of
comparative analyses was conducted with Jing Chen (RSS-07) at the following sites: SSA-Young
Aspen (YA) (D6H4T), Black Spruce (D0H6S) and Mixed (D9I1M) and with Don Deering (RSS-01) at
the SSA-OJP. 
iii) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR)
      Measurements of FPAR for each of the sites above were also made using the method described in
1993. At sites with significant understory vegetation, additional measurements were made above and
below the understory (D6H4T, D0H6S). 
iv) Canopy Chemistry
      Samples for determination of nitrogen, chlorophyll, water, etc., were acquired for the nine sites
covered by the LAI-2000 using clippers for the short sites and with a shotgun for the sites with tall
canopies. Branchlets were subdivided into current year and 1 year or greater, and the needles were
then stripped off and frozen with CO2 (see related data sets Section 1.6).

7.1.3 Spatial Resolution
      The measurements provided by the LAI-2000 should be regarded as representative of the sample
site, while those by the Ceptometer (LAI and FPAR) are provided as individual samples for each
sample point. It is recommended that these also be used at the sample site level rather than individually
since the variation from point to point can be large because of clumping; this is particularly important in
the case of FPAR. Where there was significant understory, the Ceptometer data are provided at two
levels, above and below the understory layer.

7.2.3 Temporal Resolution
      Measurements were made during FFC-93 and IFC-2 in 1994. LAI changes relatively slowly for
conifer species; hence, the values can be considered to be representative of the field campaign
specified. FPAR varies continuously, for a given location, as a function of solar geometry because
penetration is dependent on the interception of incident PAR by individual crowns clumped in a
nonrandom fashion. Three sets of measurements for each sample site are given along with time and
date to provide an indication of FPAR variability. Individual runs of measurements took approximately
10 minutes from first point to last plus the time taken to gain access to the site from the nearest clear
sky location (varied from 1-10 minutes with most sites less than 5 minutes).

8. Data Organization
8.1 Data Granularity
      The smallest unit of data tracked by the BOREAS Information System (BORIS) is all the data
collected at a site on a given day or for a given time period. 
8.2 Data Format(s)
      The Compact Disk-Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) files contain American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) numerical and character fields of varying length separated by
commas. The character fields are enclosed with single apostrophe marks. There are no spaces between
the fields.
      Each data file on the CD-ROM has four header lines of Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)
code at the top. When viewed with a Web browser, this code displays header information (data set
title, location, date, acknowledgments, etc.) and a series of HTML links to associated data files and
related data sets. Line 5 of each data file is a list of the column names, and line 6 and following lines
contain the actual data. 
9. Data Manipulations
9.1 Formulae
LAI-2000 method:
      In calculation of LAI with the LAI-2000, the foliage density is derived by measurement of the
contact frequency over the azimuthal averaged zenith bin represented by each viewing ring. Foliage
density is calculated as:
      µ = (2 x pi) - ln(T(Ø))sinØ/S(Ø) dØ 
where T(Ø) is the probability of noninterception, Ø is zenith angle, and S(Ø) is the path length. If
Page 19
there is a homogeneous cover, foliage density µ is related to LAI by canopy height and path length S is
dependent on canopy height and zenith angle:
      LAI = µz and S(Ø) = z/cos(Ø) 
Thus, LAI can be calculated by summation of the azimuthal averaged transmission over the five zenith
bins:
      LAI = (2 x pi) - ln(T(Ø))sinØcosØ 
For boreal forest canopies where the cover is not homogeneous (i.e., the foliage distribution is not
random, and a proportion of the intercepting elements are not foliage), the measurement is of effective
LAI (see Chen et al., 1997). To derive LAI, it is necessary to adjust the effective LAI for the
woody-to-total area ratio and the foliage clumping both within conifer shoots and at large scales. A
discussion of the derivation of such correction factors is given in Chen et al. (1997), with values
provided for the tower flux sites. 
Ceptometer Method:
      The derivation of LAI from Ceptometer measurements uses the formula derived by Norman (1988)
to convert from PAR transmission to LAI. This approach was derived from simulation results from a
radiative transfer model under assumptions of a spherical leaf angle distribution and random leaf
positioning. It does not involve gap fraction analysis and can be used with any beam fraction from
clear sky to overcast. Although it does not require a series of solar angles, averaging across a range of
solar zenith angles is recommended. The empirical fit of LAI to PAR transmission is:
      LAI = [{fb(1-cos Ø<s)-1} ln(Ei</Ea)]/(0.72-0.337fb)
      fb = (Ea- Ead)/Ea
where fbis the beam fraction, Ei is incident PAR under the canopy, Ea is incident PAR above the
canopy, Ead is the diffuse incident PAR, and Øs is solar zenith angle.
      Descriptions of these and other methods of LAI estimation can be found in the cited literature
(Section 17.2) and a review by Welles (1990).
      FPAR is calculated using the following formula:
      FPAR = (PAR0 - PARr - (PARt - PARs ))/PAR0 
The subscripts 0, r, t, and s refer to the incoming PAR, PAR reflected by the canopy, PAR transmitted
through the canopy, and PAR reflected by the substrate, respectively. The measurements in all cases
are the average of eight azimuthal measurements to eliminate azimuthal bias.

9.3 Calculations
i) LAI from LAI-2000
      LAI was calculated using the LAI-2000 operating in one-sensor mode with one run constituting 10
B measurements separated by A measurements at the start and end of each run. Linear interpolation
between the A values was used to calculate A values for each B measurement. B values were rejected if
the B:A ratio was greater than 1 in any of the five rings. 
ii) LAI from Ceptometer
      Determined using the method of Norman (1988), a typical Ceptometer run comprised: 
•
Total incoming 
•
Diffuse incoming 
•
Canopy 
•
Measurement 1 
•
Substrate at Measurement 1 
•
Diffuse at Measurement 1 
•
Measurement 2 
•
Measurement 3.... 
•
Measurement 10 
•
Total incoming 
•
Diffuse incoming 
      Linear interpolation based on time (decimal) for Total and Diffuse incoming was used to calculate
incoming for each measurement. Solar zenith angle was calculated based on the time and site
latitude/longitude obtained from the BOREAS Auxiliary Site Guide. 
iii) FPAR from Ceptometer
      FPAR calculations used the same data set and methods as ii) to determine the incoming. The
canopy and substrate components were as a percentage of incoming at each sample point. 
9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments
      None given. 
9.3.2 Calculated Variables
      LAI, FPAR. 
9.4 Graphs and Plots
      None. 
10. Errors
10.1 Sources of Error
      None given. 
10.2 Quality Assessment 
10.2.1 Data Validation by Source
      Checks were made prior to storage to make sure anomalous values were not stored. In the case of
LAI-2000, measurements were acquired only before sunrise and after sunset and in the absence of
significant amounts of cloud, or where the cloud was fast moving. Measurements were redone if the
number of invalid data points (indicated by an instrument beep) was higher than 2 on a standard run.
These data sets were discarded.
      Similarly, where a single Ceptometer measurement contributing to the average was unexpectedly
Page 21
high or low, for example in the case of diffuse measurements, where the shadowing device was not
completely over the instrument, the average was recalculated using an additional eight samples. 
10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment
      It is difficult to draw conclusions on the subjective quality of the data; however, it is clear that such
estimates are only as good as the assumptions made in derivation. The Chen et al. (1997) paper
discusses these assumptions for LAI and compares a range of instrument measurements. The cause
and effects of error on the representativeness of measurements varies with instrument and tree species,
and particularly with clumping at a range of scales. Nevertheless, the estimates are consistent with
alternative approaches. 
10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters
      Error in LAI from LAI-2000 and Ceptometer from Chen et al. (1997) varies with tree species, but
is in the range of 15-30%. This error is comparable but not necessarily the same as for allometry.
      Error (n=10) in FPAR varies with the degree of clumping in a canopy but is typically less than
10% for FPAR of greater than 0.7. The error increases and may reach 30% where the canopy is highly
variable. There is no consistent pattern in error variation with solar geometry. 
10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments
      None given. 
10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center
      BORIS staff reviewed the data during the data base loading process for clarity and consistency. 
11. Notes
11.1 Limitations of the Data
      None given. 
11.2 Known Problems with the Data
i) LAI from LAI-2000
      The data set is exclusively of an incomplete conifer canopy. The assumptions in translating from
transmission to LAI may not strictly apply. In particular, the assumption of random arrangement of
needles in space is not true, which leads to underestimation of LAI. An empirical correction to convert
from shoot projected area to needle projected area has been suggested to adjust for this effect (Gower
and Norman, 1990). These empirical corrections, however, have not been applied to the data.
Representative correction values can be found in Chen et al. (1997), along with a discussion of their
use.
      The irradiance measurement was constrained by access to an open area. In most cases, this was the
road. Edge effects were reduced by limiting the view azimuth and standing on a raised platform;
however, it is anticipated that there may still be some influence caused by the reduction in
representativeness of the azimuth average. 
ii) LAI from Ceptometer
      The azimuth averages of incoming PAR could potentially be biased by the presence of tree trunks
or gaps near the sample point. Variations in averages were noted by repeated sampling near the central
grid point. Absolute values of PAR are not given because cross comparison with the TRAC instrument
(Chen et al. 1997)(RSS-7) revealed a consistent discrepancy of approximately 230 counts. 
iii) FPAR from Ceptometer
      All values were calculated as an average of eight azimuth measurements. In the case of canopy and
substrate measurements, low incoming values resulted in null returns as an average. In these cases, the
percentage reflectance was derived from repeat measurements of the site.
Page 22
      The canopy measurement was not derived under ideal conditions because it was not possible to
obtain PAR reflectance from the real canopy. Measurements of short trees at the roadside were
substituted. The average values were not azimuth independent because of problems with the bias
introduced from direct irradiance incident on the Ceptometer in the antisolar direction; therefore,
canopy values may not be truly representative.
      The average values were computed and stored by the instrument, so no record of the eight values
that generated the average is available.

BOREAS RSS-4 1994 Southern Study Area Jack Pine LAI and FPAR Data
Stephen Plummer
Forrest G. Hall and Jaime Nickeson, Editors
S. Plummer: Institute for Terrestrial Ecology; J. Nickeson: Raytheon ITSS
The RSS-4 team collected several data sets related to leaf, plant, and stand physical, optical, and
chemical properties. This data set contains leaf area indices and FPAR measurements that were taken
at the three conifer sites in the BOREAS SSA during August 1993 and at the jack pine tower flux and
a subset of auxiliary sites during July and August 1994. The measurements were made with LAI-2000
and Ceptometer instruments. The measurements were taken for the purpose of model parameterization
and to test empirical relationships that were hypothesized between biophysical parameters and re-
motely sensed data. The data are stored in tabular ASCII files.
