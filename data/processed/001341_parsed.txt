SECOND ORDER DIRECTING DISBURSEMENT 
OF FAIR FUND  
 
On August 10, 2006, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of 
Distribution (“Plan”) proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this 
proceeding (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 54299).  No comments were received 
and on October 4, 2006, the Plan was approved.  
 
The Plan of Distribution provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $37,700,488.00 in 
disgorgement and civil penalties, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to be distributed by the Plan Administrator to 
injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan. The Plan provides 
that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the Fair Fund when a Payment File 
listing the payees with the identification information required to make the distribution has 
been received and accepted.     
 
 
On February 27, 2007, the Commission issued an Order Directing Disbursement 
of Fair Fund providing for the transfer of $38,755,624.80 following receipt of a validated 
Payment File.  The Plan Administrator has approved one additional payment in the 
amount of $756.65 and submitted a Second Payment File, which has been received and 
accepted by the staff.  Sufficient funds remain in the Fair Fund to pay this distribution.    
 
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $756.65 of 
the Fair Fund and the Plan Administrator shall distribute such monies to the investor, as 
provided for in the Plan of Distribution.  
 
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
