EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
USAID has supported the development of the Sierra Leone diamond sector since 1999. 
During that time both the diamond sector and Sierra Leone have undergone major 
transitions - from a time of civil war and conflict diamonds to a time of peaceful 
democratic governance and the promotion of diamonds for development. The diamond 
mining sector has also evolved, returning to pre-war patterns of artisanal mining that in 
itself is being overcome by mechanized mining of worked out alluvial diamond fields.  
 
The USAID program in Sierra Leone made a major contribution to this national process 
of reintegration and transformation and ending the era of conflict diamonds. With the 
changing times, it now needs to start thinking strategically about how it can best 
address the challenges this sector and its communities will face in the coming decades.   
 
BACKGROUND  
USAID support to the diamond sector has been provided primarily through a series of 
cooperative agreements with Management Systems International (MSI). Initial efforts 
organized by the USAID Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) focused on stemming the 
flow of conflict diamonds through reform of public policies that addressed its root causes 
(smuggling, exploitative systems of production and marketing, and underdeveloped 
financial services).1 The end of the war in 2002 enabled USAID’s assistance to develop 
into a more integrated diamond management program at both the policy and grassroots 
artisanal mining level, which is the focus of this evaluation. That program is still on-
going and is scheduled to end December 2007. 
 
USAID commissioned this evaluation to: (1) determine the effectiveness of its diamond 
sector interventions, focusing on those undertaken since 2004; (2) determine lessons 
learned and best practices; and (3) help inform future diamond program design. The 
evaluation was undertaken in Sierra Leone in May 2007 by an independent team of 
experts in the mining sector and democracy and governance fields. Its findings and the 
information in this report are based on extensive discussions in Washington, DC and 
within the country and with key programmatic actors abroad via telephone and e-mail, 
visits to the diamondiferous areas and mines, and an extensive review of the existing 
documentation.  
 
As the main focus of the evaluation are the activities undertaken under the current 
agreement, entitled the Integrated Diamond Management Program (IDMP), the 
evaluation focused on IDMP’s achievement of its Strategic Objective - - Sierra Leone 
diamond trade contributes positively to peace and development and its five intermediate 
results (IR): 
IR1: Improved Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) diamond management 
systems and incentives to use them effectively;

IR2: Active civil society supporting improved public and private diamond 
management; 
IR3: Private sector diamond businesses that are more transparent, competitive 
and responsive to community needs; 
IR4: Improved community diamond management systems and incentives to use 
them effectively; and 
IR5: Improved enabling environment for improved diamond management. 
At the same time, this program was a continuation of earlier efforts and many of the 
findings discussed under these IRs are attributable directly to those earlier program 
agreements. For ease of reference purposes, these pre-IDMP activities are collectively 
referred to as the “diamond program” in the Executive Summary. 
 
FINDINGS  
 
The evaluation found that USAID and US Government (USG) assistance made a 
major impact towards the development of a regulated, more transparent and more 
accountable diamond sector in Sierra Leone. This contributed towards meeting its 
Strategic Objective: Sierra Leone diamond trade contributes positively to peace and 
development. The most significant achievements of the diamond program were made 
early on, while later years were spent on smaller scale activities and experimental pilots 
which did not yield the same results. The program’s activities, issues and 
accomplishments also need to be considered within the larger context of international 
and national activities to improve the management of the diamond sector and the lives 
of artisanal miners. The results also need to be taken into consideration with the 
changing face of Sierra Leone in its transition from war to peace and development as 
well as the changes in the international diamond mining sector.  
IR1: Improved GOSL diamond management systems and incentives to use them 
effectively 
 
The evaluation found that USAID contributed directly towards improving diamond 
management systems. Starting in 1999, it provided technical assistance to the 
Strategic Mineral Resource Commission and later to the High Level Steering Committee 
(HLSC) which was established as a donor and GOSL forum for diamond policy 
discussion. The creation of the HLSC in 2003 was a direct result of USG initiative and 
some of its major accomplishments included the adoption of the Core Mineral Policy 
which provided the framework to regularize operations in the diamond sector and the 
distribution of diamond development funds2 back to the diamondiferous chiefdom 
communities through the elected district councils rather than directly to the chiefs.   
 
                                                 
2 This fund entitled the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF) was created in 2001 as a means to 
return some of the revenue generated from diamond areas, back to the diamond producing communities. 
Distributions are based on the number of licenses issued per chiefdom.

The HLSC proved to be an important mechanism early in the project but differing 
expectations between government and the donors on the purpose and utility of the 
meeting led to gradual government disengagement. The HLSC has been dormant since 
its last meeting in Oct 2006. This forum still appears to be a useful mechanism for donor 
– government coordination and exchange of information on the diamond sector given 
the critical issues still facing the sector, such as international smuggling and 
standardizing sub-regional regulation. The HLSC was a useful mechanism that should 
be resuscitated, with its objectives updated so that it becomes a pro-active policy and 
effective monitoring mechanism for both government and donor.   
 
The other major activity undertaken under this IR was the establishment of a Public 
Information Unit (PIU) in the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR) to disseminate 
factual information on the diamond sector. Work on its establishment stopped in 2006 
after IDMP- MMR disagreements over the process. The distribution of timely, factual 
information remains a critical issue for the MMR and the effort to establish this unit 
should be renewed. 3   
IR2: Active civil society supporting improved public and private diamond 
management 
 
The evaluation found an active number of civil society organizations engaged in 
efforts to improve transparency, efficiency and accountability in the mining 
sector. USAID’s diamond program made a substantial contribution to this effort early on 
by acting as a catalyst in bringing together, and initially enabling, a coalition of Civil 
Society Organizations (CSOs), international Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), 
and the Ministry of Mineral Resources to inform communities on the new Core Mining 
Policies and the use of the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF). 
This coalition, now called the National Advocacy Coalition on Extractives (NACE), made 
a significant contribution to the improvements in management of the DACDF and 
diamond sector policy and is still actively advocating and monitoring.  
   
However, the diamond program’s subsequent move towards the creation of a new 
Peace Diamond Alliance (PDA) in 2002 did not yield the same dividends. The concept 
of a coalition that brought together civil society, government, donors and the industry for 
improvements to the sector was a viable one, but the strategy of turning the PDA 
Executive Committee in Kono into an organization to receive and manage donor funding 
for activities in the sector, with the diamond program serving as its Secretariat, was not.  
 
Although the larger PDA coalition has not met as a group since 2005, a “PDA, Ltd” was 
registered and received institutional strengthening from IDMP, but never really 
functioned. At the same time, and until only recently, the IDMP administered many of its 
programs under the label “PDA” which provided an illusion of an actively functioning 
indigenous Peace Diamond Alliance.4  
                                                 
3 The PIU has a line item in the national budget thanks to HLSC and Technical Committee efforts.  
4 The program did use some CSOs that were members of the PDA for sensitization activities early on, and later used 
individual members of these CSOs as trainers for some of its programs and workshops.

The second PDA coalition established in Tongo Fields never moved beyond the 
coalition stage because of the issues with PDA Kono, but in fact still exists as a coalition 
and meets when convened by IDMP to discuss immediate issues and concerns. The 
PDA in Tongo Fields has made some impact on increasing awareness on 
environmental issues and reducing illegal and under-age mining in the area. The PDA 
coalition model used in Tongo Fields is more viable than the idea of creating new 
institutions which was used in Kono and which should not be replicated.     
 
A continuing part of IDMP was the small stone training (SST) which it started in 2004 
as a means to empower diggers. This was accompanied by widespread community 
meetings on the broader issues of the DACDF, illegal mining, and other issues such as 
child labor in the mines. By 2007 over 600 persons a year received SST, about 10% of 
those women. The course, given at the community level, is widely popular but the first-
come, first-serve, literate-only classes are not targeted, which limit its potential impact. 
Training and capacity building remains a critical need at every level, but with limited 
resources, future training should be directly targeted strategically on essential needs 
such as MMR in-service training and should reflect the trend towards mining in the 
formal sector.      
IR3: Private sector diamond businesses that are more transparent, competitive, 
and responsive to community needs 
 
The evaluation found that significant improvements have been made in this 
sector from the start of the program. Most are directly attributable to the return of 
state control over the industry and the Kimberley Certificate Process. The diamond 
program contributed to this process throughout its activities. In addition, the program 
consistently reported on industry trends, exports and industrial mining operations within 
Sierra Leone in its quarterly reports and to the HLSC which provided a useful tool for 
policy makers for both monitoring and making policy adjustments.   
 
The artisanal mining sector is moving towards small scale mechanized mining. Issues 
such as corporate social responsibility, employment conditions, and environmental 
impact of mining operations are growing in importance. This is the future of artisanal 
mining and a transition that future projects should assist. Future programming should 
follow the evolution of this sector using existing structures and channels of information 
to improve relations and understanding between the industrial mining companies and 
communities. 
IR4: Improved community diamond management systems and incentives to use 
them effectively 
 
The evaluation found that the intended result of this IR4, which was the creation 
of sustainable, diamond cooperatives working in partnership with international 
buyers to sell certificated stones directly from its production site, was not met.

Using a PDA label, the program successfully attracted two international firms to invest in 
the process and five local mining cooperatives which agreed to produce diamonds 
under the scheme, and it hired Global Witness (GW) as a monitor to document the 
process. It intended to implement an “Earth to Export” certification scheme at the 
production site to eliminate the problem of smuggling. The program was fraught with 
problems including late arrival of funding and the alleged allocation of diamond-poor 
land. It started without geological surveys or feasibility studies. The end result was a 
return to investors of about $2,000 on their $110,000 investment and cooperative 
members uninterested in continuing in the cooperative scheme without continued 
outside capital investments. Future programming to improve community diamond 
management systems and incentives to use them should instead focus on improving 
information flows, building capacity and knowledge using existing formal and traditional 
structures and organizations. The evaluation does not recommend the continuation of 
further investment in diamond cooperatives by this program.  
 
Piloted in 2005, a “SMARTER mining concept” was developed by IDMP as a training 
course to improve artisanal mining procedures. It was a pilot scheme to introduce 
improved mining techniques to limit some of the environmental damage associated with 
mining and to encourage communities to mine as efficiently as possible. The course 
could have been a valuable tool if it had been targeted towards the artisanal miners in 
the sector, but it appears to have been designed mainly for cooperatives. The 
SMARTER program should be adapted so that it can be used to assist the larger 
population of artisanal miners to improve their production in well selected areas, reduce 
illegal mining and encourage better use of human resources as the artisanal mining 
sector becomes more mechanized. The evaluation agrees with the plan to 
institutionalize the program in an existing center, such as the Eastern Polytechnic, so 
that it is available to miners on a sustainable and professional basis.  
IR5: Improved enabling environment for improved diamond management. 
 
The enabling environment has completely turned around since the start of USAID 
assistance in 1999. The principal factors for this improvement were the end of the war, 
the return of GOSL control over its diamond mining sector, the restoration of 
democratically elected government across Sierra Leone and the Kimberley Process.    
 
The DACDF has served as an incentive for chiefdoms and local governments to 
become interested in licensed mining as the return of revenues is dependent on the 
number of licenses issued in their areas. Monitoring through workshops, site visits and 
community discussions directly resulted in uncovering outstanding allocations of the 
funds and improving accountability over its end use. The evaluation finds that the 
DACDF monitoring activities undertaken by the diamond program achieved their 
purpose and that monitoring and improving accountability over the use of the fund 
should now be incorporated into existing CSO monitoring mechanisms and donor 
decentralization, good governance and integrated rural development programs.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES  
 
The program used an integrated approach of addressing key policy level issues and 
linking them with grassroots concerns and needs. This proved to be an effective 
approach when dealing with policy and accountability issues, such as improving the 
Core Mineral Policies and distribution mechanisms for the DACDF. This approach 
should be continued in future programming. But the evaluation found that many of the 
underlying assumptions for the design of a community based mining program in 2002 
proved to be unfounded as Sierra Leone returned to peace and earlier traditions of 
mining. Follow on programs continued without rethinking these basic assumptions even 
though they were not shared by others working in the sector and who had changed 
directions.  
 
Program implementation was hampered by the short-term nature of some of the 
agreements which required time/cost extensions or new agreements, sometimes with 
last minute contractual actions. IDMP also lacked a consistent set of targets and 
indicators for its IRs which made tracking of its actual performance difficult.  
 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
The diamond program supported by USAID was an important contributor in the 
international process to help the GOSL regain control over its diamond mining sector 
and stem the flow of conflict diamonds. But most of the program’s major 
accomplishments were made in these early years and before the IDMP program 
started. Although most of the other partners and donors were going down different 
tracks by 2004 the program continued unchanged even when it became clear that some 
of its strategic choices and underlying assumptions were not accurate. Assistance to the 
sector needs to be rethought and reformulated so it better reflects the needs of Sierra 
Leone in the management of its diamond sector for the next decade.  
 
In that regard, the evaluation recommends future programming use an integrated 
approach, done in coordination with the upcoming large-scale programs of other donors 
in the mining sector, and uses existing institutions to:  
 
 Continue work at the policy level, including regenerating the HLSC as a dynamic 
tool for policy makers and donors. Among the issues the HLSC should address 
are strengthening the government’s capacity for negotiation with international 
mining companies and interests; and developing a strategic vision for the future 
of the mining sector. 
 Revisit the original concept of the Peace Diamond Alliance, its legal basis, 
structures, and objectives under a national umbrella.  
 Integrate program strategy and activities with other donor programs and existing 
organizations, such as the World Bank, DFID, NACE and the Union of Mining 
Workers in Sierra Leone.

                 x 
 
 Focus on professionalizing the mining sector rather than production due to the 
diminishing levels of alluvial diamond resources and the move towards 
mechanized small scale mining. A concept to explore is establishing a 
professional resource center for training in the mining sector with the full-time 
presence of an independent diamond valuator.  
 Programs should target reducing the informal sector and encourage the excess 
workforce to move to the formal sector and other income generating activities 
such as agriculture.  
 IDMP activities did not include sub-regional coordination or activities.  The 
current IDMP program should become actively involved in the efforts to 
harmonize Mano River Union policies and regulations in the diamond sector.  Its 
position as Technical Secretariat of the HLSC places it in a unique position to 
assist the GOSL in these endeavors.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION  
 
1. DIAMOND SECTOR IN SIERRA LEONE 
History and Context  
 
Sierra Leone is rich in natural resources, including diamonds. Its diamond fields cover 
almost a forth of the country or an area of about 7,700 sq miles.  Diamonds have been 
found in the North, but the main diamond producing areas are in the southeast, in the 
drainage areas of the Sewa, Bafi, Woa, and Mano rivers. 
 
The Geological Survey of Sierra 
Leone5 first discovered diamonds in 
the Gbogbora stream, Kono district in 
1930. Prospecting was then continued 
by the Consolidated African Selection 
Trust Ltd., which later formed a 
subsidiary company, the Sierra Leone 
Selection Trust Ltd. (SLST). In 1935, 
the company was granted a monopoly 
to prospect, produce, and market 
diamonds. That arrangement was 
changed in 1955, when the company’s 
operations were confined to an area of 
310 sq miles in the Kono and Kenema 
districts. Also in 1955, the introduction 
of 
the 
“Alluvial 
Diamond 
Mining 
Scheme” led to the proliferation of 
artisanal mining activities and by 1956 
there were an estimated 75,000 illicit 
miners in Kono District.6  
 
The National Diamond Mining Company (NDMC) was formed in 1971 in which the 
Government acquired 51% of the shares and SLST 49%. They were liquidated in 1993. 
In 1999 the Koidu Holdings mining company was awarded the old NDMC lease areas in 
Koidu and subsequently acquired the Tongo lease area, which is now mined for 
kimberlite7 diamonds

depth of 600m.

By 1998, approximately 55 million carats had been produced (officially) in Sierra Leone8 
and estimates of (pre-war) artisanal miners at 500,000.9 Diamonds fueled civil war in the 
region (“conflict diamonds”), including the decade long war in Sierra Leone where the 
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) took over the diamond fields in 1994. Although a 
peace accord was signed in 1999, conflict continued and the war did not officially end 
until 2002. To stem the tide of conflict diamonds and deny RUF a market, the UN 
Security Council passed Resolution 1306 in 2000 that prohibited the import of diamonds 
from Sierra Leone until a certification process was established. The biggest 
preoccupation of donors at the time was peace and security. Government control over 
all of Sierra Leone was accomplished in 2002 and democratic governance was 
established down to the local levels in 2004 after local and district elections.    
The Kimberley Process 
 
The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was established in January 2003. The 
scheme requires governments to certify that shipments of rough diamonds had legal 
origins. Seventy two countries (including those of the EC which count as one) currently 
participate in the Kimberley Process. It includes all major diamond producing and 
trading countries. All signatories have passed national laws to establish export/import 
controls aimed at keeping out conflict diamonds.  
 
Since its introduction in Sierra Leone, the government expanded its control system from 
the district to the chiefdom level by establishing Mines Monitoring Officers (MMO) at 
these levels. Miners, dealers, and exporters must provide records and receipts of all 
transactions to the local mining office for reconciliation. The implementation of the Core 
Mining Policy and Sierra Leone’s efforts to comply with the Kimberley Process have 
resulted in a significant increase in legal mining licenses, from 100 in 2002, to 2,500 in 
2006. 
 
Although the Kimberley Process seems to be a success in its efforts to stop the flow of 
conflict diamonds, there is still significant smuggling of illicit diamonds, estimated at 
between 30% and 35%,10 some of it linked to money laundering. Improved government 
action is needed to reinforce the KPC and address this illicit trade, such as increased 
MMO coverage and control over artisanal diamond areas and increased verification 
mechanisms over miners, dealers, and exporters.

estimates go as high as 90%.

Diamond mining sector 2007 
 
The diamond sector has evolved since the conflict ended and democratic governance 
was restored. Three main trends are evident:  
 Increased governmental control over the mining sector through laws, regulations, 
monitoring, and decentralization;  
 Formalizing of the alluvial mining sector; including the creation of new mining 
companies; increased awareness of international standards and regulations; 
environmental protection; enhanced role for women; increased knowledge levels 
of miners from training, and strengthened trade unions; and 
 Decreasing alluvial diamond reserves that will result in the reduction in alluvial 
miner activities and require increased use of machinery and capital. 
Organizing workers outside of corporate mining is becoming more common. The United 
Mines Workers Union, created in 1948 and whose Kono staff were killed by RUF during 
the war, reconstituted in 2000. Currently it has 3,000 members from large and small 
scale mines and 6,000 artisanal miners who work for more than 50 license holders in 
Kono and Tongo Fields. By 2008 it expects to double its number of members from 
mining companies and add another 2,000 artisanal members.  
 
The diamond mining sector can be divided between primary and secondary mining. 
Each sector has its own characteristics and operating procedures.

Primary diamond mining is mainly of kimberlite 
deposits. Production is carried out by major mining 
companies in large mines after large-scale investments. 
These companies have in-depth knowledge of the 
geology of the areas where they are working. National 
laws and pressure from environmental organizations 
have resulted in a reasonable level of responsibility on 
the part of these companies. Depending on the nature 
of the regulations and agreements, the revenues for the 
companies and for the state can be significant. The 
evaluation team visited the Kono mine operated by 
Koidu Holdings. The mine is totally under the control of 
the company and no unauthorized persons can enter. 
The operations comply with environmental regulations 
and security procedures and the production of 
diamonds is controlled at every step of the process. 
Workers are salaried and payments are made directly into their bank accounts which 
the company helped them to open. This provides workers with access to credit and 
other banking services.  
 
Secondary diamond mining can be divided into small to medium mining activities and 
artisanal mining.   
 
 Small to medium mining activities. There are listed exploration companies as 
well as non-listed companies. Oversight by the mining authorities and regulation 
by the stock exchange over those which raise funds via the market, mean that 
there is a modicum of control over these operations. Their obligations of 
profitability imply a minimum of income (taxes and social contributions) for the 
government depending on local regulations and conventions. They have relative 
control over their production processes and they pay their workers on a salary 
basis transferred directly into their own bank accounts.  These companies have a 
reasonable knowledge of the geology of the area where they work.  
 
 Artisanal and/or illegal mining activities. There are an estimated 100,000 - 
200,000 artisanal diamond miners in Sierra Leone12. The activity is generally 
started by diggers, either as individuals or as organized groups. The miners 
depend on the owner of the land, and on a sponsor who pays them to dig in a 
“selected” site. Average daily wage is reported to be 3,000LE and 750LE for 
food.13 Diamonds are sold to dealers and finally to exporters. The proceeds from 
the dealer are shared among license holder, supporter and digger after deduction 
of expenses by the supporter. Much of this digging is done without a license. In 
general, this sector is characterized by:

evaluation was around 3,000LE for 1 US$.

 Lack of labor and environmental regulation; 
 Lack of knowledge of the geology and mining deposits; 
 Poor profitability and low revenues for miners; 
 Child labor; 
 Prostitution associated with 
the mines and sexual abuse 
of 
children 
and 
women 
workers; 
 High potential for violence; 
 High levels of smuggling and 
money laundering; 
 No wealth security; and 
 Payments are in cash, thus 
miners and diggers have no 
access to the formal sector 
banking services. 
Successive laws have been passed to address these problems but fall short on 
implementation. The primary goal of the 2003 Core Mineral Policy is the establishment 
of an internationally competitive and investor-friendly business environment in the 
mining sector. The policy emphasizes that the development of the mining sector should 
be achieved in ways that are environmentally responsible, socially responsible, and 
economically viable. The Policy states that artisanal mining plots should not exceed 210 
sq yards. However, since mining is largely unregulated, the mines often comprise 
several plots covering more than 25 acres.  
 
Environmental Issues: Although an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 hectares of lands are 
mined out and the land severely disrupted, there are few reclamation initiatives.  
Mining is ranked as the third most direct causes of land degradation in Sierra Leone 
(behind logging and firewood collection).14 Alluvial mining directly results in lost top soil 
and its exposed large pits fill with stagnant water and become vectors for malaria and 
other diseases. Streams and rivers are muddied and polluted. In one recent case, 
Sierra Diamonds Ltd, an alluvial diamond license holder, diverted a river to undertake 
mechanized exploration on the river bed. The $50 required of each mining holder to 
cover environmental rehabilitation is symbolic and has made no impact although there 
is some rehabilitation done in Kono primarily for demonstration purposes.15   
 
The USAID-funded Programmatic Environmental Assessment for the diamond program 
found that “other than the land disruption, the kinds of environmental concerns from 
artisanal diamond mining do not present substantial risks to human health or the 
ecosystems beyond that which occurs from the impoverished condition of the country 
and the poor sanitation and agricultural practices evident even within the mining 
district… Current mining practices are not environmentally appropriate proportionally,

(but) the overall disregard for the protection of the ecosystem, health and community 
constitute a much larger problem.”16  
  
Gender Issues: Although women are involved in gold mining and marketing in Sierra 
Leone, they are almost completely absent in the diamond mining sector. Artisanal 
diamond digging is hard labor and most of the diggers are young males17 although the 
evaluation team spoke to several lifetime diggers now in their 40s and 50s and away 
from the main towns, saw groups of miners walking to work that included young boys. 
There are few women diggers although the United Mine Workers reported they have a 
small percentage of female diggers as members, most of these war-widows. The lure of 
diamond wealth attracts young girls and women to mining areas who easily fall into 
prostitution. Some are as young as 10 who either come voluntarily or are sent by their 
families for income. 18  Early marriages (between 12-15 years of age) are also common. 
Many of the women associated with the IDMP program (either as a trainer or a CSO 
partner) were directly involved in mining- either as intermediaries (linking diggers with 
license holders) or as sponsors.  
    
DADCF The DADCF development fund was created in December 2001 as a means to 
return a portion of the diamond income back to the communities where the stones were 
mined. It is funded by 0.75% of a 3% royalty from diamond exports and is returned to 
the chiefdoms based on the number of alluvial licenses issued. Since distributions are 
based on the number of licenses per chiefdom, it is also seen as an incentive 
mechanism to reduce illegal mining and smuggling by encouraging the issuing of 
licenses. Since 2001, the number of 
licenses 
have 
more 
than 
doubled 
nationwide and increased tenfold in 
Kono (Graph 1 that shows licenses 
issued from 2001-200419). Diamond 
exports have also increased and the 
amount of funds deposited into the 
DACDF have almost quadrupled (Graph 
220). Districts also receive a return of 5% 
of the export value from prospecting, but 
as these licenses are issued at the 
national level, those reimbursements are 
done directly through GOSL financial 
systems and do not pass through the 
DACDF fund.

Concerns on the effective use of the fund led to a program- assisted joint CSO-
Government monitoring mission in 2003 that resulted in a grading system for chiefdoms 
on the use of the funds. Funds were also suspended at the end of 2004 due to 
persistent problems over its use. The enactment of the Local Government Act in 2004 
enabled the government to administer the funds through the newly elected district 
councils which now receive 20% of the allocation, with the chiefdom retaining the rest. 
As can be seen in Graph 2 almost $4 million has been returned to these diamondiferous 
areas for community development purposes (discussed in more depth in IR2).

2. USAID ASSISTANCE  
 
USAID assistance to the diamond sector started in 1999 with the efforts of USAID’s 
Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), and is still ongoing today. Initial work focused on 
stemming the flow of conflict diamonds and regaining Government of Sierra Leone 
(GOSL) control over the management its diamond resources so that these resources 
could benefit the people of Sierra Leone. The program expanded as the conflict within 
Sierra Leone receded with community-based activities added to make it an integrated 
diamond management program.  
 
These activities were carried out through a series of Cooperative Agreements with 
Management Systems International (MSI) based on unsolicited proposals. Specifically:  
 
1999-2002: OTI: Diamond Management Program. This $1.2 million program was 
implemented primarily through a series of technical assistance visits and partnerships 
with key stakeholders. It focused on: supporting the Kimberly Process and establishing 
a certified channel for diamonds from Sierra Leone; providing a workshop and 
radio/motorcycle equipment for the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR) mine 
monitors; monitoring the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF) fund 
and sensitizing communities about its existence. The program was evaluated in 2002 
and was found to have met its objectives as the certification process had raised the

level of legitimate exports of rough diamonds in Sierra Leone from $1.2 million (1999) to 
$26 million (2001)21 and because the DACDF had started to return diamond-generated 
revenue back to the communities.  
 
2002–2004: Diamond Project-$60,000. Diamond Policy and Management (PDAP)22-
$992,731; Diamond Policy and Management Project (DIPAM)23- $1,273,801. These 
agreements implemented parts of the same program. The PDA agreement was focused 
on supporting the establishment of the Kono Peace Diamond Alliance, which was 
expected to demonstrate that the alluvial diamond industry can maximize benefits to 
local miners/diggers and their communities, minimize corruption, mobilize local 
surveillance and mines monitoring, and convert consumer awareness around conflict 
diamonds into reconstruction of the war-devastated diamond area of Kono.24 DIPAM 
had a similar purpose and worked at the policy reform level.   
 
2004 – 2007: Integrated Diamond Management Program (IDMP).25 Initially seen as a 
two-year $2 million pilot project, it has since been extended and is now scheduled to 
end December 2007 with a total budget of $2.9 million. It is a continuation of the 2002-
2004 programs. Its purpose is to “develop a pilot alluvial diamond mining tracking 
system grounded in providing better prices to miners and their laborers.26”  A results

Interventions, focusing on those undertaken since 2004; 
 Draw on lessons learned and best practices to date; and 
 Reflect on weaknesses and failure to inform a future diamond program design. 
 
The evaluation was undertaken in Sierra Leone in May 2007 by an independent team of 
experts in the mining sector and democracy and governance fields. The evaluation 
team conducted extensive interviews both within Freetown and the diamondiferous 
districts of Kono and Kenema. These included government officials, donors and their 
implementing partners, private sector actors, traditional leaders, civil society 
representatives, miners, diggers and community members. Interviews were also 
conducted in Washington, DC and via telephone or email with programmatic actors 
abroad. The complete list of persons interviewed is in Annex B.  
 
The team also conducted an extensive review of existing documentation (Annex D) and 
site visits to artisanal mines, industrial kimberlite mines and small scale mining 
activities. It observed small stone training being conducted by IDMP as well as the 
buying and selling of diamonds. Methodology for the evaluation is in Annex C. 
 
As the main focus of the evaluation is the activities undertaken under the current IDMP 
agreement, the evaluation focused on the achievement of its Strategic Objective: Sierra 
Leone diamond trade contributes positively to peace and development and this 
evaluation report is structured according to its intermediate results (IR): 
 
 IR1: Improved GOSL diamond management systems and incentives to use 
them effectively; 
 IR2: Active civil society supporting improved public and private diamond 
management; 
 IR3: Private sector diamond businesses that are more transparent, 
competitive and responsive to community needs; 
 IR4: Improved community diamond management systems and incentives to 
use them effectively; and 
 IR5: Improved enabling environment for improved diamond management.

SECTION 2: PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND 
RESULTS  
 
The purpose of the IDMP was to develop a pilot integrated finance and alluvial 
diamond mining tracking system grounded in providing better prices to miners and 
laborers. According to the IDMP, this approach recognized the multi-faceted nature of 
the problem; was community based; included a proactive government; and addressed 
business practices and incentive structures and the entire production and marketing 
chain. It was a direct continuation of the programs started under earlier Cooperative 
Agreements with USAID (DIPAM/PDAP) and OTI.   
 
According to the Cooperative Agreement, IDMP intended to increase prices for miners’ 
production at the first point of sale (90% of price in Antwerp) by establishing an Earth to 
Export scheme and by introducing a credit scheme financed by reputable diamond firms 
in cooperative production. This was to be done in conjunction with its continuing work 
on the Peace Diamond Alliance. In addition, the program was to continue its policy 
reform work, and monitor use of the DACDF.  
 
2.1 INTERMEDIATE RESULT 1: IMPROVED GOSL DIAMOND 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND INCENTIVES TO USE THEM 
EFFECTIVELY 
 
Activities: Under IR1, the IDMP served as the Technical Secretariat for a High Level 
Steering Committee (HLSC) on diamond management systems and policy. The HLSC 
was established in May 2003 as a sub-committee of the Development Partnership 
Committee (DEPAC)27 in response to concerns raised by the US Ambassador over 
project reports that cited the levels of illegal diamond exports at $350 million to $400 
million. The HLSC met bi-monthly for 2004 and 2005, successfully addressing some 
potentially destabilizing issues such as the adoption of a retroactive tax on exporters by 
the National Revenue Authority (NRA) and accountability issues such as a cabinet 
decision to turn the implementation of projects funded by the DACDF to the National 
Commission for Social Action (NCSA) instead of through the local communities.  
 
The HLSC was provided with solid technical information provided by the Technical 
Secretariat. In addition, the Technical Secretariat, which included experts from DFID 
and others, developed a detailed implementation plan for the Core Mineral Policy, which 
provided the framework to regularize operations in the diamond sector and distribution 
of the DACDF through elected district councils instead of directly back to the chiefs. The 
Technical Secretariat last met in February 2007.

Also undertaken under this IR 
were efforts to establish a 
Public Information Unit (PIU) 
in the MMR to disseminate 
factual information on the 
diamond sector. A line item 
for the PIU was created within 
the national budget, and the 
terms of reference for the PIU 
were developed by the IDMP. 
But work on its establishment 
stopped in 2006 after IDMP and the MMR disagreed over the process for its 
establishment. IDMP intended to hire a consultant to develop the PIU’s terms of 
references and structures while the MMR wanted to use the Ministry of Information for 
this purpose and use the consulting fees for other things.   
 
IDMP and DIPAM also collected and provided diamond trade data and analysis. This 
was provided in its quarterly reporting to USAID and to the HLSC. Among some of the 
specific studies undertaken by the diamond program was the study of the Anti-Money 
Laundering Act, Mining the “Chaos” in Sierra Leone’s Diamond Fields (a study on 
artisanal mining) and a Credit Study. This last study provided the estimates used by the 
American Ambassador for the HLSC that 90% (or $350-$400 million) of the diamond 
production was smuggled out of the country every year.  
 
IDMP provides a full time person28 in Freetown for IR1 to serve on the Secretariat and 
to follow policy developments. He is assisted by the Chief of Party who represents the 
project for policy discussions and in international forums. 
  
Findings: The areas targeted for USAID assistance 
(policy coordination, provision of technical assistance 
and increasing the information at 
the 
national 
level) 
were 
appropriate 
and 
warranted 
support. The HLSC proved to be 
an important mechanism early 
on, but differing expectations 
between government and the 
donors on its purpose and utility 
of the meeting led to gradual 
GOSL disengagement. Its last meeting was in October 2006. 
Political will to seriously address corruption and eliminate its 
links with cross-border smuggling and money laundering 
remains an issue and reinforces the need to restart these

meetings. The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) project funded by DFID 
that is in the process of coming on line will have a high level committee but this 
committee will have a transparency purpose and broader membership, including civil 
society monitoring organizations and the mining industry, so it will not replace or 
duplicate the need for the HLSC as a donor and GOSL forum.  
 
The donors found the HLSC meetings extremely useful, but most GOSL participants in 
the HLSC perceived the meetings as donor driven with a donor agenda focused on 
obtaining GOSL compliance or action. They felt in return, the donors provided very little 
in terms of international information (intel) or additional resources to help with the 
requested action. There were a few, however, including the Minister of Interior, who saw 
it as a useful venue to exchange information and develop strategies to address 
problems in the sector.

Another issue the HLSC could address is the issue of linking the DACDF allocations to 
the number of licenses issued. This is an incentive to issue more licenses, but it could 
mean that diamond-poor districts receive a disproportionate share if they issue many 
licenses but have poor production. A more fair way might be to factor production levels 
from each chiefdom into the equation, which would also serve as a disincentive to 
smuggling.    
 
There is still a critical need for a systematic and wider distribution of information on the 
diamond mining sector and government policies at every level. The IDMP analysis of 
issues within the diamond sector provided useful background information for policy 
makers but the evaluation found others working in the field questioning the accuracy of 
some of their findings (in particular those related to the scope of illegal exports and 
artisanal workers).  
 
The problems with the PIU also appeared to be related to 
differing perceptions and expectations between government 
and donors. MMR officials agreed with the need for the PIU, 
but they felt isolated from the process by which it was being

                              13 
 
established which they saw as donor-driven and not reflective of their concerns or ideas 
of how this should be accomplished. On the other hand, the donors (i.e. the diamond 
program) were focused on getting it established as quickly and efficiently as possible so 
they could benefit from its end-use (increased information flows). 
 
Recommendations:  
 
• The Technical Secretariat needs to become reactivated and continue to meet 
regularly on issues of diamond management and policy even in the absence of 
the HLSC.  It should proactively engage the donors and the GOSL to resuscitate 
the HLSC and ensure coordination between the large scale assistance programs 
now coming into the sector (World Bank, DFID EITI). 
 
• The HLSC concept needs to be updated and resuscitated as there is still a 
pressing need for donor and government collaboration and for the sharing of 
essential information on national diamond sector management and international 
issues such money laundering by organized crime through diamond trafficking. 
To ensure its effectiveness and longevity, GOSL buy-in and ownership of the 
meeting is essential. The meeting should not be reconstituted until there is a 
common consensus among donors and the GOSL on the purpose of the meeting 
and its terms of reference. This process should start with discussions with the 
more proactive and interested GOSL members of the HLSC on how it can be 
brought back and made more relevant to the GOSL side, so that the GOSL 
participants become invested in the process and it becomes a collaborative effort 
rather than donor-driven.  The Technical Committee should also engage the 
GOSL members on the Committee on specific issues that require policy-level 
assistance so that the process to reconstitute the HLSC is grounded in 
demonstrated need. Ensuring coordination between government agencies on 
critical issues in the sector as well as with the donors is a good governance 
imperative, and the process of rejuvenation could be effectively used as a 
capacity building opportunity for the participants and their institutional systems.   
 
• With the end of conflict and the return of a democratically elected government 
down to local levels, diamond management policies and systems have improved. 
But major governance and accountability issues remain that should be directly 
addressed by any future program. These include the lack of means for the MMR 
and others to enforce and implement mining regulations, the role and power of 
chiefs, land ownership and tenure, the lack of transparency throughout the 
mining sector and the continued imbalance in the incentive systems that make 
fighting illicit trade and corruption extremely difficult.    
 
• The IDMP and the DFID projects should collectively engage the MMR on the 
outstanding issues that prevented the establishment of the PIU and find a 
mutually acceptable way to help the MMR with its creation. The process by which 
a government unit, such as a PIU, is created should also be approached as an 
opportunity to improve government systems and administration as well as a

means to improve governance through the end-use of its output (i.e.: 
information). MMR ownership of the process to establish the PIU is essential or 
the unit, if it is established, will not be used to its fullest potential. This process 
should start with direct discussions with the MMR on why donor-efforts to 
establish the PIU failed and what they think needs to be done to create such a 
unit. From there, the program can play a mentoring and facilitating role to help 
the MMR develop a realistic, and donor-acceptable, strategy for its creation and 
effective functioning and use. As with the HLSC, this process should be seen as 
an opportunity for capacity building and developing appropriate systems within 
public administration.  
 
2.2 INTERMEDIATE RESULT 2: ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY SUPPORTING 
IMPROVED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DIAMOND MANAGEMENT 
 
Activities: The diamond program under IR2 worked to increase civil society oversight 
and advocacy for improved diamond management systems. Very early on, the program 
acted as a catalyst to bring together, and enable a coalition of Civil Society 
Organizations (CSOs), International Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) with the 
MMR to inform communities on the new Core Mining Policies and use of the DACDF. 
This DACDF Coalition, now named the National Advocacy Coalition on Extractives 
(NACE), is still active in the sector.   
  
In 2002, the DIPAM/PDAP program moved from assisting the DACDF Coalition to the 
creation of a new movement called the Peace Diamond Alliance (PDA). According to 
the Cooperative Agreements, the purpose of the PDA was to promote the diamond 
industry at the same time as helping to empower the communities to play a greater role 
in managing their diamond resources. It was intended to convert the diamond resources 
from a “source of war and desperation to the foundation for peace and prosperity.”29    
 
Although there were high hopes for the PDA, which was formally inaugurated in Kono 
by the President in December 2002, it became untenable once it moved from the 
concept of a coalition of civil society, government, donors and the industry meeting to 
coordinate efforts to improve diamond sector management, to one of establishing an 
institution to receive and manage donor funding (with the USAID program serving as its 
secretariat).   
 
The PDA Coalition met annually with its last meeting in 2005. At the same time, the 
project helped establish a “PDA, Ltd.” in Kono. This “PDA, Ltd” received institutional 
strengthening from IDMP and some funding through the World Bank for projects and 
trips to Ghana and Sri Lanka for some of its Executive Committee Members. In April 
2004, the IDMP created a second “PDA” in Tongo Fields along the lines of the initial 
Kono PDA Coalition.  This “PDA” is still in existence and meets when requested by 
IDMP.  With IDMP funding, the Tongo Fields PDA was active early on in collective 
action to increase awareness on environmental issues and working to reduce illegal

buying and under-age mining in their area. It also worked on a related program through 
the International Rescue Committee funded by the Department of Labor that contributed 
to the reduction of child diggers and girl prostitutes associated with mining operations.  
 
A continuing part of IR2 is small stone training (SST) which IDMP started in 2004 as a 
means to empower diggers. Still using the PDA label, this training is accompanied by 
widespread community meetings on broader issues in the sector, such as use of the 
DACDF, illegal mining and child labor. By 2007 over 600 persons a year were receiving 
SST, about 10% of these women.

The main office of the IDMP 
project is in Kono and it has a 
sub-office in Tongo Fields. Until 
recently, both used the PDA name 
and logo to identify their offices 
and work. They now both use 
IDMP branding.  Each office has a 
staff with community outreach 
officers/trainers.

IDMP 
Deputy COP is located in Kono

Findings: The program contributed to: 1) informed civil society activism in the mining 
sector, most notably by assisting the DACDF Coalition early on; 2) increased 
government and traditional leader receptivity to civil society inputs through sensitizing 
activities, and 3) improved accountability for and the more appropriate use of DACDF 
funds. However, the sheer number of donors and programs working in community 
awareness, empowerment and democracy and governance makes attribution of these 
results to any one program impossible.

CSO monitoring of the DACDF, most notably in the program’s initial years of operation, 
resulted in direct improvements of its operation. According to DIPAM, 60% of the first 
tranche of DACDF funds disappeared while 90% of the funds were accounted for by the 
third tranche (2002).30 The DACDF Coalition also started a grading system for 
chiefdoms on the use of the funds and their active community sensitization programs 
encouraged community members, including women, to question traditional leaders 
about the use of the funds and their prioritization. Annex F provides a list of specific 
examples of the use of the funds.  
 
The decision to abandon the DACDF Coalition and create a “PDA Ltd” in its stead was 
questionable as was its implementation. The “PDA Ltd” never really functioned as an 
institution31 and defined its legal relationship with IDMP on the basis of a workshop 
report that described a division of responsibilities 
between the two. The PDA Chairman met with the 
evaluation team and demanded to know where the 
funds raised under the PDA name had gone (both 
from USAID and the World Bank) and complained of 
having no say in the hiring or operation of the PDA’s 
“secretariat” (the IDMP program). At the same time, 
the project’s strategy to “project the Alliance as a 
winner”32 through use of the PDA label for most of its 
USAID-funded activities33 and its active marketing in 
international forums, created and maintained the 
illusion of an actively functioning indigenous Peace 
Diamond Alliance which did not exist.    
 
IDMP/DIPAM/PDAP worked with a large number of CSOs 
but over time tended to favor certain individuals within them, 
thus the strengthening tended to be individual rather than 
institutional. The program made a concerted effort to include 
women’s organizations on the PDA, most notably in Tongo 
Fields where three were very active. The leaders of these 
groups were quite impressive and had made notable 
accomplishments. For example, SINAVA rehabilitated 20 
acres of worked out mining land where it is growing rice for 
sale. PDA Executive Committee and IDMP helped its 
lobbying efforts so SINAVA was able to obtain title to the land. These women were also 
at the forefront of the PDA’s programs to combat illicit and child mining in Tongo. They,

and the rest of the PDA, said sensitizing required funding34 and told the evaluation team 
they were looking for a new issue that would get funding for their PDA. These women’s 
organizations also received training on their rights and how to organize through a World 
Vision program funded by USAID.   
 
The small stones trainings exceeded their targets and are widely popular but did not 
target “diggers” as described in the project documentation. The primary beneficiaries of 
the first-come, first-serve, literate-only-classes are potential intermediaries in the 
diamond chain (buyers/sellers) or MMO hopefuls. Ten percent of the SST students are 
reported to be women who attend the training to “protect their husband’s interests.”35 
Half of IDMP’s eight trainers are women. The two women in the class (of 20) visited by 
the evaluation said they were housewives who wanted to become buyers. Most of the 
men (14) said they wanted to become MMOs. Training provided a sense of 
empowerment to its participants but its lack of targeting limited its potential impact and 
made no difference in the price of diamonds for buyers.  
 
A two-week training held by the diamond program in 2001 for MMOs was found to have 
made a lasting impact. MMOs still spoke of it having provided them with a sense of 
purpose and professionalism. This targeted training was followed up by the delivery of 
motorcycles and radios to help enable them to do their job.36  If the program had 
followed up with these MMOs (and with training to other MMR officials in the field) this 
could have made a significant difference in the management of the sector at the local 
levels.37  
 
Recommendations:  
 
 The concept of the Peace Diamond Alliance needs to be revisited to determine if 
there is still a purpose for its existence, and if so, its legal basis, structures and 
objectives. The idea of creating a new institution, rather than strengthening a 
coalition, should not be pursued.    
 
 Training and capacity building remains a critical need at every level, but with 
limited resources, future training needs to be targeted directly where it could 
make the most impact on program results. Among the critical needs are in-
service training for MMOs and MMR officials, training in modern environmentally 
friendly small scale mining techniques and corporate responsibilities vis-à-vis the 
government and surrounding communities. Training needs to be institutionally 
grounded and the evaluation concurs with the intention of the 2007 IDMP

food for attendees as “they come for food and won’t come without it.”

36 After 6 years of hard service, most of these motorcycles and radios are now beyond repair. 
37 For example, several MMOs who had received training, successfully used some of the skills and equipment 
provided by the program to coordinate the seizure of $550,000 worth of illegally purchased diamonds. They split the 
reward (40% of the value of the seized stones) with the participating police officers and see the rewards system as a 
useful incentive for inter-agency cooperation.

workplan to institutionalize training in an existing institution. Developing an 
existing institution to serve as a permanent center for mining policy/research and 
training should be explored.    
 
 Future support to civil society efforts should be provided through existing 
mechanisms, such as NACE, that have proven track records and institutional and 
programmatic sustainability. 
 
2.3 INTERMEDIATE RESULT 3: PRIVATE SECTOR DIAMOND 
BUSINESSES THAT ARE MORE TRANSPARENT, COMPETITIVE AND 
RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY INTERESTS 
 
Activities: According to the Program Description, the main purpose of IR3 was to 
attract reputable businesses to participate in the IDMP program and to decrease the 
amount of illegal mining in the Tongo Fields area. The activities regarding international 
investment in the cooperative scheme are discussed in IR4. As the cooperative scheme 
was not pursued after 2005, IR3 activities in subsequent years focused on increasing 
corporate responsibility, including better environmental practices. 
 
Graph 9: IDMP EXPENDITURE for IR3 
As discussed in IR2, the program 
was active in Tongo Fields where 
the number of illegal buyers was 
perceived as a security threat in 
2004. The program spearheaded 
an awareness program through 
the use of the Tongo Fields PDA. 
Chiefs were informed on the 
incentive value of licensed mining 
(DACDF) 
and 
subsequent 
awareness 
programs 
targeted 
issues such as child mining and child prostitution. 
  
In both Kono and Tongo Fields, the program worked to improve relations between the 
growing presence of mining companies and communities. Four large companies are 
currently in the program areas (Koidu Holdings, Target Resources, SLDC and Crown 
Mining). The situation in Kono is more tense than in Tongo Fields where some 
community members have had to be relocated because they were in the blasting area 
of the Koidu mine.    
 
The project implemented IR3 activities through its field offices in Tongo Fields and 
Kono, and through its US-based Technical Advisor who was responsible for attracting 
businesses to the cooperative scheme.  
 
Findings: Findings for the cooperative scheme are discussed in IR4. For the other IR3 
activities, significant improvements have been made in the private sector since the start

of the program in 1999. Most of these are directly attributable to the return of state 
control over the industry and the Kimberley Process. The diamond program contributed 
to this process throughout all of its activities. In addition, as discussed in IR1, the 
program consistently reported on industry trends, exports, and industrial mining 
operations which provided a useful tool for policy makers for both monitoring the private 
mining sector and making policy adjustments.  
  
The trade in conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone has 
ended, but much remains to be done in terms of 
improving 
corporate 
responsibility 
and 
responsiveness. There is still a lingering attitude 
among the MMR and GOSL that they need to make 
concessions to the large international mining firms or 
they won’t come to Sierra Leone. One contract, 
currently 
under 
review 
by 
the 
Law 
Reform 
Commission actually states that in case of a 
contractual conflict with Sierra Leonean legislation, 
the 
national 
law 
is 
invalid.38 
However, 
the 
international market, and Sierra Leone has changed and it is important that the 
Government of Sierra Leone negotiate from a position of strength.  In fact, there is 
currently a crisis in the international mining industry caused by three fundamental 
factors: 
• Lack of exploration over the last years has 
involved the scarcity of mining reserves; 
• Lack of investment in mining technologies and 
equipment has resulted in the incapacity to 
open new mines quickly; and 
• Lack of education and training has resulted in 
a scarcity of mining engineers and geologists. 
In addition, international regulations in the mining 
sector39 help ensure that large international mining companies are more respectful of 
the interests of the countries in which they work. The artisanal mining sector in Sierra 
Leone is also changing and moving towards small scale mechanized mining. Thus 
issues such as corporate social responsibility, decent work standards, and attention to 
environmental impact of mining operations are growing in importance.  
 
Recommendations: 
• Empower the MMR and GOSL by improving their basic knowledge and 
information on world markets, mining trends, leadership and negotiation skills so 
they can make the best decisions and negotiate effectively with the larger 
international mining firms.

• Future programs follow the evolution of the mining sector in Sierra Leone which 
is away from manual artisanal mines to small scale mechanized mining and help 
smooth the transition for the excess labor force. This should be seen as an 
opportunity to get more diggers into the formal sector where they can then 
access the benefits this sector can provide.  
• Future programs should work with existing organizations in this transition, in 
particular the Mine Workers Union which is concerned with basic workers rights 
which is starting to make headway in organizing the artisanal mining sector, as 
well as with women’s organizations and organizations representing other 
underrepresented groups.   
• Environmental protection should be a cross-cutting issue for future programs. 
Raising awareness of the damage caused by artisanal mining and the need to 
rehabilitate mining sites should be incorporated throughout all programmatic 
activities and policy dialogue. 
 
2.4  INTERMEDIATE RESULT 4: IMPROVED COMMUNITY DIAMOND 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND INCENTIVES TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY 
 
Activities: IR4 activities focused on the creation of the Cooperative Scheme for 
diamond production. This involved establishing an “Earth to Export Tracking System”, 
developing buying and finance schemes and improving cooperative artisanal mining 
procedures. The process was monitored through a sub-contract with Global Witness. 
 
The Earth to Expert scheme intended to increase prices for miners’ production at the 
first point of sale (90% of price in Antwerp) by recruiting reputable buyers, establishing 
an external verification system through Global Witness, ensuring secure storage for 
purchases, facilitating GOSL export certification by providing evidence of origin of stone, 
and facilitating fair trade marketing through rigor in scheme and NGO endorsement. 
 
The Alluvial Mining Financing Scheme was aimed at reducing the indebtedness of 
miners to their supporters. The original concept was a donor-funded revolving loan fund 
administered by a commercial bank. USAID required an environmental assessment of 
the potential impact of the credit scheme before IDMP could loan money. Although 
almost $600,000 was reserved for that purpose in the IDMP Cooperative Agreement, 
the scheme was never implemented because the Programmatic Environmental 
Assessment (2005) concluded that the credit program was not a workable tool as “ the 
condition for the credit model proposed by PDA is not ripe… and the overall impact of 
the program will be negligible.”  
 
The program was supposed to have started in December 2003, but delays in the 
environmental assessment led IDMP to develop a direct financing scheme where 
reputable diamond firms would provide seed capital and purchase the diamonds 
produced based on prices “at least as high” as those set by GOSL export valuation.40

This buying scheme was intended to increase prices for miners at the first point of sale 
by eliminating middlemen. The diamonds were to be sold via transparent open market 
tenders, with investor profits limited to a fixed commission. Tender sales results were to 
be reported back to the diggers and excess profits were to be repatriated to the 
cooperatives. IDMP was to serve as local facilitator with the private sector paying for 
support services after two years. 
 
Twenty-five cooperatives were registered and direct financing was found for five in 2005 
(Rapaport Group which invested $55,000 in four cooperatives and Kono’s Hope which 
also invested $55,000 in one coop and 2 small enterprises).  Cooperatives opened 
accounts in Rokel Bank and Global Witness monitored the process, although it started 
late due to contracting issues. Results of production were disappointing. The diamonds 
found in the four cooperatives financed by Rapaport had an estimated export value of 
only $2,800.41   
 
Improving artisanal mining techniques and reducing environmental degradation was to 
be part of the cooperative program and a SMARTER (Sustainable Mining by Artisanal 
Miners) model was developed through a sub-contract to CEMMATS. SMARTER was to 
be field tested in the cooperatives, but was developed after their mining activities ended 
also due to prolonged contracting issues. IDMP did some subsequent training on 
SMARTER in 2006 and anticipates providing this training to the best graduates of the 
SST. 
 
Findings: The cooperative scheme was fraught with 
problems- 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
conceptualization 
and 
implementation. The concept behind cooperatives was to 
change the buying scheme to reduce the number of 
intermediaries, however, in order to convince diggers and 
miners to buy into the new buying scheme it was necessary to 
ensure them that the new scheme would be more secure than 
their former one. Since this was not achieved, the 
cooperatives treated the funds provided as a gift and did not 
necessarily use them to improve their production capacity. 
When the cooperatives did not succeed, and further external 
financing was not forthcoming, the diggers and miners 
abandoned them – some returning to agriculture, and artisanal 
diamond activity reverted to previous practices. 
 
The concept to sell diamonds directly to overseas buyers, through the channel of 
foreign investors was sound, but since the cooperatives did not produce enough 
diamonds to recover the investment this component did not succeed. Investors found 
the amount initially offered by IDMP unrealistically low “even for the most benevolent of 
investors.”42 In addition, the buying scheme depended on the finance scheme, which 
also proved not to be viable, since banks do not extend credit to workers in the alluvial

diamond sector considering the risks too high. From evaluation interviews with bankers 
and dealers, it is clear that traditional donor guarantees or insurance coverage 
mechanisms are not enough to change this perception of risk. Nevertheless, some 
individuals interviewed during the evaluation believe the failure of the pilot was not the 
concept of the cooperative scheme itself, but rather the challenges and constraints 
encountered in the context of Sierra Leone as well as faulty implementation.  
 
Implementation problems were numerous. Land allocated was allegedly diamond poor. 
Site selection and production was done without geological surveys or feasibility studies. 
Securing funding from direct investors took more time than anticipated yet the promise 
of investor funding lured some individuals and cooperatives away from agriculture and 
into mining. IDMP staff did not oversee field activities and lacked technical expertise in 
alluvial diamond mining.  
 
The external monitoring conducted by Global Witness fulfilled the program’s 
requirements for “monitoring of the systems to control production” and provided useful 
information and insight on the progress of the cooperative scheme. But although these 
types of periodic assessments are useful from a project management perspective, they 
are not sufficient to be able to adequately monitor compliance or deter smuggling which 
requires a more active presence.    
  
The program successfully negotiate a special type of exporting regime with the MMR for 
the cooperative pilot that allowed the cooperatives to function without the $40,000 
export license fee providing they paid 5% of export value and exported directly. One 
long term outcome of the program was that the MMR authorized the issuing of mining 
licenses to registered cooperatives. Previously, only registered companies could hold 
mining rights. 43 
 
Recommendations: Future programming to improve community diamond management 
should focus on improving information flows and capacity building using existing formal, 
informal, and traditional structures and organizations. Future programs should consider 
the establishment of a “Mining Information and Training Center” in Koidu in an existing 
institution to ensure sustainability. This Center would have:  
 
• The capacity to train alluvial miners and mining companies’ workers (including 
the diamond valuation training and SMARTER program); 
• An information center accessible to miners and workers; and 
• An independent valuation bureau, using the independent valuator in Koidu, to 
help miners to evaluate their finds. 
 
The evaluation team does not recommend the continuation of further investment in 
diamond cooperatives by this program.

2.5 INTERMEDIATE RESULT 5: IMPROVED ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 
FOR IMPROVED DIAMOND MANAGEMENT 
 
Activities: IR5 activities were intended to provide an enabling environment for activities 
in the first four IRs of the program. A lot of attention was placed on monitoring the 
disbursements of the DACDF. Initially, the program worked through the DACDF 
Coalition, giving subgrants to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Talking Drum Studios 
(Search for Common Ground) in 2002-2003 for advocacy and community awareness 
building. A nine-day monitoring visit was conducted in February 2003 and after the 
program moved away from the DACDF Coalition, it turned to holding workshops on its 
use, on a more or less annual basis, followed up by site verification visits.

which 
also 
focused much of its attention on 
the administration of this fund.  
 
Another main activity under IR5 
was to raise national awareness 
of 
diamond 
policy 
and 
management which it did through 
the grants to CRS/Talking Drums, radio shows, community meetings and other venues. 
It also raised international awareness of diamond issues in Sierra Leone through its 
attendance at international meetings and at Kimberley Certification Process meetings. 
 
Findings: The enabling environment improved dramatically since program activities 
started in 1999. The principal factors for this improvement were the end of the war, the 
return of GOSL control over its diamond mining sector, the restoration of democratically 
elected government across Sierra Leone and the Kimberley Process.  The program 
helped improve these diamond policies through its IR1 activities. Enabling legislation 
and regulation still remain an issue as does enforcement of the improved diamond 
policies and regulations. MMR lacks the capacity and means to cover diamond 
producing areas and the cash and carry nature of unlicensed artisanal mining along with 
porous borders easily enables illicit dealers to purchase and smuggle diamonds into 
international money laundering networks.  Outside of the KPC process and attending 
international conferences and perhaps a few policy discussions, the program did not 
address issues of regional harmonization of laws and policies within the Mano River 
Basin or how to collectively address the cross-border trafficking of illicit stones. Efforts in 
this regard were initiated by UNDP and International Alert in Liberia (“Diamonds for 
Development”) in a large international conference in 2006 which IDMP attended.  The 
evaluation agrees with the two sub-regional activities proposed in its last work plan

(May 2007) that includes participation in the Diamonds for Development program and 
linking CSOs within the MRU.    
 
DIPAM/PDAP/IDMP made an effort to increase women’s participation by including a few 
women’s organizations in some activities, encouraging women to attend its small stones 
training course and community meetings, and using female trainers. But it did not 
address the broader issues constraining the participation of women. Some of these 
barriers are substantial, such as the right to own property. The program also only 
marginally approached enabling environment issues related to the rights and 
responsibilities of diggers and miners- such as updating labor laws, worker protection, 
the prevention of child labor and violence against women and children by miners.     
 
The DACDF was a focus for the USAID diamond 
program activities. As discussed in IR2, over the 
years, monitoring of the fund by the program and 
others directly resulted in the improvement of its 
administration. The biggest improvement came 
from the policy decision that their distribution had 
to go through the elected district councils to 
ensure better accountability over the receipt 
and use of the funds. Some district councils are 
now requiring chiefdoms to submit proposals before they are given funding which forces 
them, for the first time, to justify use of the funds. The decision to allocate 20% of the 
funds for district councils also increases formal government control over the use of 
these government resources. As there were many organizations involved in efforts to 
improve the DACDF process, the value added by the program (beyond being 
instrumental in the creation of the DACDF Coalition) was its connection with the HLSC 
as Technical Secretariat and its ability to raise accountability and management issues 
with policy makers and donors.  
 
Recommendations:    
 
• The program achieved its objective of ensuring a percentage of the funds 
generated by the export of diamonds are returned to the diamond producing 
communities and the DACDF process has become firmly institutionalized. 
Monitoring and improving the DACDF systems and use of the Fund should now 
be handled by existing CSOs monitoring mechanisms and by donor programs 
that focus on improving public administration and accountability (decentralization, 
good governance) and the effective end use of the fund (integrated rural 
development).  
 
• Gender be mainstreamed into future program activities. In coordination with the 
women’s organizations already working with the program, contacts should be 
made with the Ministry of Women and Gender to identify critical constraints and 
issues that the program can address in its policy and grass-roots level activities

to empower women in areas related to mining. In addition, the program should 
target wives of diggers as agents of change that can encourage male family 
members to enter the formal system of income generation rather than continue 
subsistence artisanal mining with the hope of maybe one day a big win.   
 
• The program should become actively involved in the efforts to harmonize sub-
regional policies and regulations in the diamond sector. Its position as Technical 
Secretariat of the HLSC places it in a unique position to assist the GOSL in these 
endeavors as well as help ensure the application of the new policies and 
structures in the border districts of Kono and Kenema where it currently 
implements activities. Some of the issues that need to be addressed include 
harmonizing policy and legislation/regulations (on issues such as licensing, land 
use and mining, taxation, labor and environmental protection); and related cross-
border issues such as smuggling, illegal population movements and 
environmental damage. In addition, the current IDMP program is well-placed to 
provide the linkages between CSOs involved in the diamond sector as described 
in its May 2007 workplan, however the evaluation recommends that the CSOs 
from Sierra Leone that it links are actively functioning watchdog organizations, 
such as NACE, and that it also consider exploring linkages with subregional 
professional organizations such as mining unions and associations. 
 
• The program should assist the EITI initiative. EITI can be expected to make 
significant improvements in the enabling environment for program activities along 
with the World Bank program for a comprehensive and integrated program in the 
mineral sector. EITI criteria include regular publication of all mining payments to 
government (including state-owned enterprises), audits and reconciliation of 
revenues and payments, with the active participation and monitoring by civil 
society. EITI is expected to start with rutile and bauxite mining which are 
undertaken by large companies and whose license payments are an important 
source of revenue. Expanding EITI to the small-scale artisanal nature of diamond 
mining will be challenging and is an area which should be assisted by the IDMP 
program. The program can also help ensure that transparency measures 
required under EITI are extended to the DACDF. This should remove a lot of the 
discretionary power and use over the funds at the chiefdom level.  
 
SECTION 3: PROGRAM DESIGN AND 
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES  
 
3.1 PROGRAM DESIGN  
 
The program was initially designed during the peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone 
and when the country was in great flux. Immediate concerns of donors were to stem the 
flow of conflict diamonds, finding employment for the large numbers of ex-combatants 
AMEX International, Inc. 
USAID/Sierra Leone Diamond Sector Program Evaluation Report 
                              26 
 
and the reintegration of returnees back into their communities. This focus on peace and 
security has only recently been replaced by a focus on development goals.  
 
The approach used consistently throughout the program was to develop an integrated 
program to work with government and civil society to improve their capacity to manage 
diamond resources and increase their incentives to do so.44 This started with policy 
reform to reduce the incentives for smuggling and improve business practices and 
included grassroots work with artisanal mining once these areas became accessible. 
The project was to provide the link between the grass roots and key policy makers. 
When the diamondiferous areas opened after the war, the project design added the 
concept of the PDA and starting community-based mining in order to increase digger 
and community income. 
 
Some of the program assumptions included: 90% of the diamond production (2002) was 
exported illegally (with a value of between $350,000,000 and $400,000,000) and the 
value of illicit trade would increase significantly in the next few years due to the rapid 
increase in mining activity; miners were in “debt bondage” and wanted to change from 
the traditional supporter system to a cooperative approach where their winnings and 
losses were shared by all; the mining and digging population was 200,000 – 400,000 
men aged 15-30 which was the group most likely to resort to violence if left unattended; 
access to credit was a significant problem and the formal banking systems were not 
used for the vast majority of transactions.45 It also assumed the only way miners could 
improve their economic welfare was to improve their production, so they focused on 
access to credit and increasing diamond production.  
 
Findings: The approach of linking the policy levels to community levels through the 
program’s service as the HLSC Technical Secretariat and through their community 
outreach was effective and provided tangible results as detailed in the IR discussions. 
The community-based mining strategy and the PDA institutional focus proved not to be 
effective and resulted in a narrow focus that isolated the program from other donor/CSO 
programs in the sector as the project progressed. 
 
The evaluation team found, that as Sierra Leone returned to peace and its pre-war 
traditions of mining, several of the program’s underlying assumptions proved to be 
unfounded and that some of its concepts were not grounded in diamond mining 
expertise. For example, interviews with diggers and others involved in the diamond 
sector and the comparison between the distribution in kimberlite and alluvial diamonds, 
indicate that smuggling is not as high as estimated, and as reserves in alluvial 
diamonds are declining, alluvial mining activity is decreasing.  Many diggers expressed 
preference for the traditional supporter system rather than entering into a collective 
system saying it gave them food to eat while allowing them to keep working for a big win 
that they would not have to share. Others preferred the steady work of corporate mining 
which paid them daily wages and benefits, while others were ready to return to 
agriculture.

Diamonds are a nonrenewable resource. The design did not factor in the worked-out 
nature of the diamondiferous areas and the fact that declining reserves could not 
support the massive increase in workers who went into artisanal mining in the 
immediate post-war period. Many of these have already returned to agriculture or other 
income generating activities and the number of artisanal miners is currently estimated at 
100,000 to 200,00046.  
 
Follow-on programs continued the same activities even though conditions were 
changing and some of their approaches were questioned by others. As an example, 
DIPAM reports in 2003 note “skepticism in USAID/Conakry remains as to the feasibility 
of the program and its appropriateness to the Missions strategy”47 and DFID’s “failure to 
fund mutually agreed-upon activities.”48  
 
3.2 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 
 
The program worked diligently to implement the activities described in its Program 
Descriptions and work plans. It produced a wealth of reports and studies which are still 
used. Implementation of this program in a country with destroyed infrastructure and a 
dearth of human resources was extremely challenging, but the program benefited from 
the dedication and resourcefulness of its staff.  
 
Some of the major issues found relating to implementation included: 
• Increasing isolation of the program and its activities with other donor programs 
and civil society efforts after 2003.49 Its inward focus on the management of its 
PDA/cooperative programs served to distance itself from the work of others 
active in the sector.  
• Lack of diamond mining expertise. It is unusual to see a program that assists 
artisanal miners in a venture such as cooperatives that does not have a geologist 
to valuate the potential and the reserves of the selected sites, and a small scale 
mining engineer to plan and organize the process of alluvial exploitation. 
 
• The lack of a legal relationship between PDA and MSI. The PDA became a legal 
entity so that it could receive and manage funds and ensure sustainability for 
program activities (although it is questionable why it was registered as a for-
profit). But MSI never formalized its relationship with PDA even though it raised 
funds and implemented programs in its name. The difference between IDMP’s 
packaging of the PDA concept and the reality of program implementation led to

bitter feelings and power struggles among some PDA Ltd members as they tried 
to get what they thought was legally theirs.   
• Piece-meal implementation of the program through a series of agreements and 
amendments meant a lot of project energy was expended in developing new 
proposals and waiting for official confirmation of continued funding. This had a 
detrimental impact on staff morale and on program implementation and results. 
For example, the SMARTER mining scheme was to run concurrently with the 
cooperative process, but authorization to implement the contract was delayed 
and the process was completed only after mining had ended.   
• Lack of appropriate delegation of responsibility to in-country staff. The program 
started during the conflict and was covered out of MSI’s Washington-based 
headquarters. Although an office was opened in Freetown in late 2002, major 
decisions and planning continued to be done by a non-resident technical advisor 
and program manager. Even local finances today are handled off-shore. The 
project finance officers in country had no idea of the budgets for programs or 
administration.  
• The program tracked activities by IR but did not its expenditures which makes a 
cost-benefit analysis of program components impossible. MSI estimated the 
amounts spent per IR for the evaluation and these are amounts used in the 
tables in this report.     
• Lack of a consistent set of targets and indicators which made tracking of its 
actual performance difficult. Some of this was due to USAID changes in its 
reporting requirements, and some of this was due to weaknesses in the 
program’s monitoring and evaluation design.

SECTION 4: CONCLUSIONS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
4.1 ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: SIERRA LEONE 
DIAMOND TRADE CONTRIBUTES POSITIVELY TO PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY 
 
The diamond program supported by USAID was an important contributor in the 
international process to help the GOSL regain control over its diamond mining sector 
and stem the flow of conflict diamonds. The Sierra Leone diamond trade contributes 
positively to peace and prosperity through its subsistence of large numbers of diggers, 
the return of some of the revenue generated back to the diamondiferous chiefdoms 
through the DACDF and through the incentive system that rewards the turning in of 
smugglers.  
 
The USAID diamond sector program was designed during a time of conflict and 
uncertainty about the future of diamond mining in Sierra Leone. Its initial OTI work even 
included the RUF as the diamond fields of Kono were still under its control and the 
major concerns were stopping the tide of conflict diamonds and constructively 
occupying the large pool of potentially destabilizing ex-combatants. Through the hard 
work of this program and others, times have changed in Sierra Leone. As the country 
becomes increasingly stable, the focus is no longer on conflict diamonds but diamonds 
for development and finding sub-regional solutions for transnational problems such as 
smuggling.  
 
The evaluation found that most of the diamond program’s major accomplishments were 
made early on, and before the IDMP program started. These were considerable as 
noted in the individual IR sections. But by 2004, it was already clear that this program 
was on a different track than those of the other partners and donors in the sectors and 
that some of its basic assumptions and strategic choices were questionable. Yet, the 
program continued down the same track unabated.  
 
Future assistance to the sector needs to be rethought and reformulated to reflect the 
critical needs of Sierra Leone for the next decade. The final work plan just developed by 
the project for its remaining eight months is focused on ensuring sustainability for some 
of the project outputs, such as SMARTER. The evaluation finds the focus of this work 
plan appropriate and a move back on track for the program.

4.2 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMING 
 
• Continued assistance at the policy level and re-establishment of the HLSC as a 
dynamic tool for policy makers and donors. Among the issues the HLSC should 
take up is the need to strengthen the government’s capacity for negotiation with 
international mining companies and interests, develop a strategic vision for the 
future of the mining sector, and revise the DACDF allocation formula so that it 
factors in actual production instead of just the number of licenses. 
 
• Donors focus on professionalizing the mining sector rather than diamond 
production. A concept worth exploring is the establishment of a professional 
resource center for training for the mining sector using an existing institution that 
would include the full-time presence of an independent diamond valuator.  
 
• Programs contribute to reducing the informal sector and moving workers towards 
the formal system. This is already occurring as a natural outcome of the shift 
from artisanal mining to small scale mechanized mining. For example, programs 
should encourage excess workers towards alternative livelihoods and other 
viable income generating activities such as agriculture.  
 
• Programs mainstream gender and address the barriers to equal participation in 
the sector- in particular in the policy making arena and decision making on the 
use of the DACDF funds at the chiefdom levels. Female family members should 
be included in programs addressed at helping miners make the transition into 
other areas as they have a vested interest in the outcome and interviews suggest 
they prefer stability and wealth creation over subsistence mining and moving to 
follow minerals.   
 
• Program strategies and activities ensure coordination and synergy with other 
programs and activities in the sector, such as those of the GOSL (and in 
particular assistance to the MMR), other donors, institutions, and organizations, 
such as the World Bank, DFID, NACE and the Union of Mining Workers in Sierra 
Leone. They should also ensure coordination with regional and sub-regional 
efforts to combat mineral trafficking and money laundering.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 
 
The evaluation of the USAID Diamond Program took place in April - May 2007. As the 
requested by the Scope of Work, the evaluation team focused primarily on the 2004- 
present time period. However as this program was a continuation of the program started 
in 1999, and as many of the results were made before the current program started, the 
evaluation team looked at the entire period, but used the Results Framework for the on-
going program as the means to structure the evaluation and content of the report. 
 
The objectives of the evaluation in the Scope of Work were to:  
• Ascertain the effectiveness of past and current USAID Diamond Sector 
Interventions, focusing on those undertaken since 2004; 
• Draw on lessons learned and best practices to date; and 
• Reflect on weaknesses and failure to inform a future diamond program design. 
 
The evaluation was primarily undertaken in Sierra Leone with initial work in Washington 
DC. 
 
In Washington, the team met with relevant USAID/Washington staff, including those in 
the Africa, DACHA and other bureaus, those responsible for environmental issues and 
the Special Advisor for the State Department for Conflict Diamonds. It also met with MSI 
staff responsible for the administration of the diamond program in Washington. The 
team started its initial review of documentation and prepared a work plan for the field 
work. 
 
In Sierra Leone, the team undertook an extensive array of meetings with partners, 
stakeholders and others in Freetown and in the diamond districts of Kono and Kenema.  
Key actors who were not in –country or in Washington were interviewed either by phone 
or through the use of an e-mail questionnaire.  The evaluation coincided with an 
increase in political activity related to the upcoming elections, which meant that a few 
key GOSL individuals were out “pre-campaigning” and were not available. However, the 
team was still able to meet with a broad range of governmental, donor, civil society, 
international NGO, private sector and international mining companies.  
 
In the districts of Kono and Kenema, the team was able to: 
• Visit both offices of the IDMP program; 
• Speak to PDA members and its current Executive Directors; 
• Visit reclamation of sites done by women’s organizations, FESS and the MMR 
• Attend a small stones training 
• Visit buildings constructed through use of the DACDF fund and drove on 
community roads rehabilitated through the use of DACDF funds.  
• Visit artisanal mines in Koidu, Tongo Fields and surrounding areas 
ANNEX C 
 
 
 
 
USAID/Sierra Leone Diamond Sector Program Evaluation Report                             C-2 
• Visit the Koidu Holdings kimberlite mine 
• See Kenema District’s records books on the DACDF fund 
• Visit the independent diamond valuator in Koidu 
• Visit Chiefdom Mine Monitors, MMR Mine Monitors and commercial mine 
monitors 
• Speak to diggers, miners, buyers, dealers and salesmen in Kono and Kenema 
• Observe the buying and selling of diamonds  
• Visit some PDA members in their own settings, such as World Vision in Tongo 
and the Alluvial Gold and Diamond Miners Association in Koidu 
• Visited several cooperatives in Kono and Kenema Districts 
• Visited communities and spoke to community members, traditional leaders and 
local CSO members 
 
 
In Freetown, the team visited the MMR to see its working conditions as well as those of 
other relevant Ministries and Government offices. This evaluation overlapped with a visit 
by FESS and we were able to benefit from their expertise on land reclamation.  
 
The evaluation also undertook a review of available documentations, which was 
extensive. The diamond sector in Sierra Leone has been of great international interest 
and the USAID funded diamond program has been extremely prolific. 
 
Preliminary findings by the team were discussed in a round table at USAID attended by 
key stakeholders and partners to validate preliminary findings and refine 
recommendations. 
 
The team would like to thank all of those who participated in the round table and in 
evaluation interviews. In particular, the IDMP program staff and USAID-Sierra Leone 
who were generous with their time, insight and expertise.
