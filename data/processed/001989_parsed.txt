What is the Kimberley Process?
The Kimberley Process is the international 
initiative launched in 2003 to prevent rough 
diamonds from being used to finance such 
brutal civil wars as those which occurred in 
the diamond-producing countries of Sierra 
Leone, Liberia and Angola in the 1990s. 
The 74 countries which participate in the 
Kimberley Process agree to trade rough 
diamonds only with other countries in the 
organization.  Diamonds must be shipped 
with Kimberley Process certificates and must 
be in tamper-resistant containers.
How does the U.S. control rough 
diamonds?
The Clean Diamond Trade Act of 2003 and 
Executive Order 13312 commit the U.S. 
government to the Kimberley Process and 
establish the framework for how the U.S. 
government implements that commitment.   
The Rough Diamonds Control Regulations of 
2004 spell out the legal obligations of U.S. 
rough diamond importers and exporters.  The 
laws and regulations are available at: 
www.state.gov/e/eeb/diamonds.
What are the legal obligations 
of a rough diamond importer or 
exporter?
All imports and exports of rough 


diamonds must be accompanied by a 
Kimberley Process certificate.
Exports of rough diamonds from the 


United States must be accompanied 
by a U.S. Kimberley Process certificate 
obtained from a U.S. Kimberley 
Process Authority licensee and 
validated by the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Imports and exports of rough 


diamonds must be sealed in a 
tamper-resistant container.  Packaging 
must have an indicator or barrier 
to entry that could reasonably be 
expected to provide visible evidence 
that tampering had occurred.  
Standard mailing and express 
consignment packaging alone is not 
considered tamper-resistant.
Rough diamonds may only be 


imported from, or exported to, 
countries that are participants in the 
Kimberley Process.  The current list of 
participating countries can be found 
at: www.kimberleyprocess.com
New regulations issued in May 2008


 
require that all imports of rough 
diamonds, regardless of the value of the 
shipment, be entered by a formal entry 
for consumption using a U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) Form 3461 
(Entry/Immediate Delivery) and a CBP 
Form 7501 (Entry Summary).
Importers and exporters must fax 


a copy of all Kimberley Process 
certificates (U.S. and those received 
from other countries) to the U.S. 
Census Bureau at: 1-800-457-7328. 
Rough diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire 


are prohibited from entering the 
United States because of a diamond 
embargo imposed in United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1643 
(2005).
Rough diamond importers and 


exporters must retain records of  all 
Kimberley Process (U.S. and foreign) 
certificates for five years.  
As of September 2008, rough 


diamond importers and exporters 
must file an annual report including 
total import and/or export activity 
and stockpile information via email 
to: USKimberleyProcess@state.gov.  
Beginning in 2009, reports will be 
due annually on April 1.
Do I need a Kimberley Process 
certificate?
U.S. shippers need a Kimberley Process 
certificate to export rough diamonds 
including gem quality or industrial 
diamonds that are unworked or simply 
sawn, cleaved or bruted and classified 
under Harmonized Commodity Description 
and Coding System subheadings 7102.10, 
7102.21 and 7102.31.
How do I obtain a Kimberley 
Process certificate?
Kimberley Process certificates are available 
only by entities licensed by the U.S. 
Kimberley Process Authority.  To obtain 
a U.S. Kimberley Process Authority 
license, contact the USKPA at the offices 
of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee: 
212-997-2002.
