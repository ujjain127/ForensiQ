he National Institute of Standards and Technology was established in 1988 by Congress to ‘‘assist industry in
the development of technology . . . needed to improve product quality, to modernize manufacturing processes,
to ensure product reliability . . . and to facilitate rapid commercialization . . . of products based on new scientific
discoveries.’’
NIST, originally founded as the National Bureau of Standards in 1901, works to strengthen U.S. industry’s
competitiveness; advance science and engineering; and improve public health, safety, and the environment. One
of the agency’s basic functions is to develop, maintain, and retain custody of the national standards of
measurement, and provide the means and methods for comparing standards used in science, engineering,
manufacturing, commerce, industry, and education with the standards adopted or recognized by the Federal
Government.
As an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department’s Technology Administration, NIST conducts basic and
applied research in the physical sciences and engineering, and develops measurement techniques, test
methods, standards, and related services. The Institute does generic and precompetitive work on new and
advanced technologies. NIST’s research facilities are located at Gaithersburg, MD 20899, and at Boulder, CO 80303.

FOREWORD
  
In 1997 the General Accounting Office (GAO)  identified information technology (IT) security as
“a new high-risk area that touches virtually every major aspect of government operations” (report
# GAO/HR-97-30).  In doing so, GAO went beyond dozens of specific recommendations in its
prior reports to identify underlying factors.  Several are people factors, not technological factors,
e.g., “insufficient awareness and understanding of information security risks among senior
agency officials,” “poorly designed and implemented security programs,” “a shortage of
personnel with the technical expertise needed to manage controls,” and “limited oversight of
agency practices.”
 The key to addressing people factors or competencies is awareness, training, and education. 
Certainly the need for government-wide attention to this area of IT security has never been
greater, so issuance of this publication, Information Technology Security Training Requirements:
A Role- and Performance-Based Model, (Training Requirements) is especially timely.  This
document has been designed as a “living handbook” to have the longest useful life possible as the
foundation of and structure for “do-able” training by Federal agencies.  To meet this objective,
the following elements have been included in this document’s design: 
C
Dates, references, or other items that would quickly outdate the Training Requirements
have been excluded.  Excluded also are “terms du jour” and items which may be specific
to a given agency or Department.  Technical jargon changes rapidly—even though the
meanings are not significantly different. Thus, to avoid unnecessary outdating, the
document uses terminology that is most consistent across Federal agencies and broadest
in scope to encompass all information processing, storage, and transmission resources
and technologies—for example, “Information Technology.”   A glossary of key terms is
provided in an appendix.
 C
An extensible set of  knowledges, skills, and abilities (KSAs) structure the Training
Requirements and are linked to the document through generic IT Security Body of
Knowledge, Topics and Concepts categories as shown in Exhibit 4-4.  Thus, new
technologies and associated terminology may be added to the KSAs (which are to be
maintained in a separate database), and will be tracked forward through the generic IT
Security Body of Knowledge, Topics and Concepts categorization to recommended
instructional blocks defined in Chapter 4.  This linkage precludes a need to continually
revise or supersede the key chapter that addresses training criteria with respect to security
requirements affected by the ongoing evolution of information technology.
 
C
Finally, the emphasis of the Training Requirements is on training criteria or standards,
rather than on specific curricula or content.  The training criteria are established according
to trainees’ role(s) within their organizations, and are measured by their on-the-job
performance.  This emphasis on roles and results, rather than on fixed content, gives the
Training Requirements flexibility, adaptability, and longevity.

CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION
1.1  Background 
Federal agencies and organizations cannot protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
of information in today’s highly networked systems environment without ensuring that each
person involved understands their roles and responsibilities and is adequately trained to perform
them.  The human factor is so critical to success that the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public
Law [P.L.] 100-235) required that, “Each agency shall provide for the mandatory periodic
training in computer security awareness and accepted computer practices of all employees who
are involved with the management, use, or operation of each Federal computer system within or
under the supervision of that agency.”   
In accordance with P.L. 100-235, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was charged with developing
and issuing guidelines for Federal computer security training.  This requirement was satisfied by
NIST's issuance of  “Computer Security Training Guidelines”  (Special Publication [SP] 500-
172) in November 1989.  In January 1992, OPM issued a revision to the Federal personnel
regulations which made these voluntary guidelines mandatory.  This regulation, 5 CFR Part 930,
is entitled “Employees Responsible for the Management or Use of Federal Computer Systems”
and requires Federal agencies to provide training as set forth in NIST guidelines.
The OPM regulation requires training: for current employees; new employees within 60 days of
hire; whenever there is a significant change in the agency's IT security environment or
procedures, or when an employee enters a new position which deals with sensitive information;
and periodically as refresher training, based on the sensitivity of the information the employee
handles.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, “Management of Federal
Information Resources,” Appendix III, “Security of Federal Automated Information Resources,”
re-emphasizes these mandatory training requirements.  In addition, it requires that prior to being
granted access to IT applications and systems, all individuals must receive specialized training
focusing on their IT security responsibilities and established system rules.
The NIST guidelines in SP 500-172 provided a framework for determining the training needs of
particular categories of employees (including contractors) involved with sensitive but
unclassified computer systems.  The framework reflected the late 1980's when the IT
environment was mainframe oriented.  The focal point of SP 500-172 is its Training Matrix,
shown on the following page as Exhibit 1-1.

1.2  Purpose
OMB Circular A-130, as revised in 1996, required NIST to update SP 500-172.  As a result, this
document supersedes SP 500-172 and presents a new conceptual framework for providing IT
security training.  This framework includes the IT security training requirements appropriate for
today’s distributed computing environment and provides flexibility for extension to
accommodate future technologies and the related risk management decisions.

1.3  Principles of the New Approach: Results-Based Learning
The learning approach presented in this document is designed on the following principles to
facilitate results-based learning.  
C
Focuses on job functions, or roles and responsibilities specific to individuals, not job
titles, and recognizes that individuals have unique backgrounds, and therefore,
different levels of understanding. 
The earlier 500-172 focused on various categories of employees.  This new approach
recognizes that an individual may have more than one organizational role, and will need
IT security training which satisfies the specific responsibilities of each role.  In addition,
because it is not focused on job titles, this approach facilitates more consistent
interpretation of training criteria across organizations.
Everyone needs basic training in IT security concepts and procedures.  Beyond the basics,
this new approach establishes three distinct levels of IT security training: Beginning,
Intermediate, and Advanced.  Each level is then linked to roles and responsibilities. 
Because individuals may perform more than one role within the organization, they may
need intermediate or advanced level IT security training in their primary job role, but
only the beginning level in a secondary or tertiary role.  The new concept facilitates
training tailored to individual employee needs and career mobility, and to an
organization’s evolving or changing mission and mix of job functions.  Thus, the concept
of refresher training (traditionally viewed as repetitive learning) gives way to the “just-in-
time” learning approach, as an individual’s or organization’s IT security training needs
evolve or change.
C
Delineates the differences among awareness, training, and education.  
First, this approach considers awareness programs (which are generally well established
in Federal agencies/organizations) as a pre-requisite to IT security training.  This
document defines the term “IT Security Basics and Literacy,” as the transitional learning
activity between “Awareness” and “Training.”   IT Security Basics and Literacy
comprises relatively generic concepts, terms, and associated learning modules that do not
significantly differ among categories of employees or organizations.  Thus, this approach
eliminates redundancies across audience categories and establishes a baseline of IT
security knowledge across government which all employees can reasonably be expected
to have as they change jobs and organizations.  This baseline is independent of specific
IT systems.
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 1.  Introduction
6
Second, the critical differences between “Training” and “Education” are often
overlooked.  “Education” is clearly identified in this new model as a separate learning
level, while recognizing that the education level’s applicability is limited to an
organization’s designated IT security specialists.   Providing formal education to this
group is outside the purview of most Federal agency training programs—with some
notable exceptions among national security-related agencies.  This document takes the
view that education (as distinguished from training) and associated on-the-job experience
are essential for IT security specialists to be able to fulfill their roles in an effective
manner.  The provision of specific criteria for the education level is beyond the scope of
NIST’s mandate and, therefore, is beyond the scope of this document.
C
Provides an integrated framework (planning tool) to identify training needs
throughout the workforce and ensure that everyone receives appropriate training.  
  
The model presented in this document relates job function to required IT security
knowledge.  This allows managers to identify the training needed to fulfill their IT
security responsibilities, to understand the consequences of denying or deferring training,
and to plan and schedule training according to organizational priorities.
C
Provides a course development tool.  
 
Course developers can readily identify the learning outcomes expected for individuals in
various roles with varying responsibilities.  This will facilitate the development of IT
security course material targeted to the needs of the Federal workforce and will encourage
the development of “plug and play” training modules that can be readily customized or
adapted to an organization’s needs.
C
Provides a structure for evaluating learning effectiveness.
  
Providing training to individuals does not necessarily ensure that learning has occurred. 
Learning can best be demonstrated by subsequent on-the-job performance.  This
document’s learning objectives are designed to be performance-based, rather than
content-based, and to provide benchmarks for evaluating learning effectiveness.  Further,
this document requires evaluation as a component of an organization’s IT security
training program and provides an evaluation planning process and a discussion of levels
of evaluation.
 
C
Is extensible.
   
This document is intended to be issued in looseleaf format for extensibility and ease of
updating.  It is designed to be used as a “living” handbook and reference, with evolving

criteria, exhibits, and appendices that will enable Federal agencies and organizations to
ensure that their workforce keeps abreast of changes in information technology and the
impact of such changes on the protection of information and systems.
1.4  Use of this Document
The overall goal for use of this document is to facilitate the development or strengthening of a
comprehensive, measurable, cost-effective IT security program which supports the missions of
the organization and is administered as an integral element of sound IT management and
planning.  Protecting the value of an organization’s information assets demands no less.  This
approach allows senior officials to understand where, in what way, and to what extent IT-related
job responsibilities include IT security responsibilities, permitting the most cost-effective
allocation of limited IT security training resources.
The issuance of this document is not intended to significantly modify Federal agencies’ ongoing
IT security awareness programs and activities, or to invalidate their IT security training courses
or courseware.  Rather, their courses will require comprehensive review and revalidation in
accordance with this new performance-based model and requirements.  It is expected that
agencies and organizations will find training gaps and will need to establish priorities and
strategies for filling them.  This process cannot be accomplished by a single organization’s IT
security program office working alone.   Instead, it requires a broad, cross-organizational strategy
at the executive level to bring together various functions and organization entities that may not
have previously worked together.  The perspectives and expertise of training center personnel,
course designers, program analysts, IT security specialists, training evaluators, and specialists in

Chapter 2, Learning Continuum — Model and Overview: Introduces a role-based
learning model that presents learning as a continuum from awareness through training to
education and presents concepts associated with the model.  Briefly discusses IT security
awareness and education, and explains that detailed treatment of these areas is outside the
scope of this document.  Provides a comparison highlighting the differences among the
three levels of learning and provides a transition to the following chapters, which
concentrate on the two training layers of the model, Security Basics and Literacy and
Roles and Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems.    Discusses learning styles and
effective teaching methods, ways of learning and implications for instruction, and
presents some additional considerations for adult learning.
C
Chapter 3, IT Security Basics and Literacy: Presents a core set of generic IT security
terms and concepts for all Federal employees as a baseline for further, role-based
learning, expands on those basic concepts, and provides a mechanism for students to
relate and apply on the job the information learned.   
C
Chapter 4, Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training:  Builds on the
Security Basics and Literacy training layer by presenting specific performance-based
training requirements and outcomes mapped to job functions.  Examines six role
categories relative to IT systems—Manage, Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and
Operate, Review and Evaluate, and Use (with a seventh category, “Other” included to
provide extensibility).  Presents a matrix to relate the categories to three training content
categories—Laws and Regulations, Security Program, and System Life Cycle Security.  
Identifies a set of 12 high-level IT security body of knowledge topics and concepts
appropriate to each cell in the matrix from which curriculum content can be constructed. 
The training requirements presented here were derived from the IT security program
requirements established in Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130.

CHAPTER 2.  LEARNING CONTINUUM — MODEL AND OVERVIEW
Exhibit 2-1
IT Security Learning Continuum
 
2.1  Introduction to the Model 
The model presented as Exhibit 2-1 is based on the premise that learning is a continuum. 
Specifically, learning in this context starts with awareness, builds to training, and evolves into
education.  This model provides the context for understanding and using this document.  
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 2.  Learning Continuum
14
The model is role-based.  It defines the IT security learning needed as a person assumes different
roles within an organization and different responsibilities in relation to IT systems.  This
document uses the model to identify the knowledges, skills, and abilities an individual needs to
perform the IT security responsibilities specific to each of his or her roles in the organization.
The type of learning that individuals need becomes more comprehensive and detailed at the top
of the continuum.   Thus, beginning at the bottom, all employees need awareness.  Training
(represented by the two bracketed layers “Security Basics and Literacy” and “Roles and
Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems”) is required for individuals whose role in the
organization indicates a need for special knowledge of IT security threats, vulnerabilities, and
safeguards.  The “Education and Experience” layer applies primarily to individuals who have
made IT security their profession.
The model illustrates the following concepts: 
C
“Security Awareness” is explicitly required for ALL employees, whereas “Security Basics
and Literacy” is required for those employees, including contractor employees, who are
involved in any way with IT systems.  In today’s environment this typically means all
individuals within the organization. 
C
The “Security Basics and Literacy” category is a transitional stage between “Awareness”
and “Training.”  It provides the foundation for subsequent training by providing a
universal baseline of key security terms and concepts. 
C
After “Security Basics and Literacy,” training becomes focused on providing the
knowledges, skills, and abilities specific to an individual’s “Roles and Responsibilities
Relative to IT Systems.”  At this level, training recognizes the differences between
beginning, intermediate, and advanced skill requirements.
C
The "Education and Experience” level focuses on developing the ability and vision to
perform complex multi-disciplinary activities and the skills needed to further the IT
security profession and to keep pace with threat and technology changes.
Learning is a continuum in terms of levels of knowledge, but the acquisition or delivery of that
knowledge need not proceed sequentially.   Given resource constraints, organizations have a
responsibility to evaluate against the continuum both the scope of their IT security training needs
and the effectiveness of the training provided, to be able to allocate future training resources to
derive the greatest value or return on investment.

2.2  Levels of Learning
2.2.1  Awareness
Awareness is not training.  The purpose of awareness presentations is simply to focus
attention on security.  Awareness presentations are intended to allow individuals to
recognize IT security concerns and respond accordingly.  In awareness activities the
learner is a recipient of information, whereas the learner in a training environment has a
more active role.  Awareness relies on reaching broad audiences with attractive
packaging techniques.  Training is more formal, having a goal of building knowledge and
skills to facilitate job performance.
A few examples of IT security awareness materials/activities include:
 
C
Promotional/speciality trinkets with motivational slogans,
 
C
A security reminder banner on computer screens, which comes up when a user logs on, 
C
Security awareness video tapes, and
C
Posters or flyers.
 
Effective IT security awareness presentations must be designed with the recognition that people
tend to practice a tuning-out process called acclimation.  If a stimulus, originally an attention-
getter, is used repeatedly, the learner will selectively ignore the stimulus.  Thus, awareness
presentations must be on-going, creative, and motivational, with the objective of focusing the
learner’s attention so that the learning will be incorporated into conscious decision-making.  This
is called assimilation, a process whereby an individual incorporates new experiences into an
existing behavior pattern.
Learning achieved through a single awareness activity tends to be short-term, immediate, and
specific.  Training takes longer and involves higher-level concepts and skills.  For example, if a
learning objective is “to facilitate the increased use of effective password protection among
employees,” an awareness activity might be the use of reminder stickers for computer keyboards. 
A training activity might involve computer-based instruction in the use of passwords, parameters,
and how to change the passwords for organization systems.
Detailed guidance on IT security awareness is outside the scope of this document.  Awareness, as
originally defined in 1989 in NIST SP 500-172, “creates the [employee's] sensitivity to the
threats and vulnerabilities of computer systems and the recognition of the need to protect data,
information, and the means of processing them.”  The fundamental value of IT security
awareness programs is that they set the stage for training by bringing about a change in attitudes
which change the organizational culture.  The cultural change is the realization that IT security is
critical because a security failure has potentially adverse consequences for everyone.  Therefore,
IT security is everyone’s job.

2.2.2  Training
The “Training” level of the learning continuum strives to produce relevant and needed
security skills and competency by practitioners of functional specialties other than IT
security (e.g., management, systems design and development, acquisition, auditing).   The
training layers are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 (Security Basics and Literacy) and 4
(Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training).  
2.2.3  Education
The “Education” level integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various
functional specialties into a common body of knowledge, adds a multi-disciplinary study
of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social), and strives to produce IT
security specialists and professionals capable of vision and pro-active response.  
Historically, “computer security specialists” were practitioners appointed from the ranks
of “computer specialists” (or another functional specialty), as if designation alone made
those individuals specialists in security.  Security responsibilities were often assigned as
collateral to the duties of the primary functional specialty.  
At best, Federal agencies paid for occasional training courses for their designated Computer
Security Officers or specialists; but few agency officials recognized a need to enroll their
designees in a formal computer security educational program—or required evidence of
qualification or certification as a condition of appointment or collateral designation.  IT Security
professionalization was not mandated as a component of agency computer security training
programs: it was outside the scope of the then-current Federal computer security training
guidelines (SP 500-172).
Now, however, the IT Security Specialist/Officer/Program Manager functions have become too
technologically and managerially complex to be successfully accomplished—especially on an
ancillary or collateral basis—by practitioners lacking a comprehensive set of competencies. 
Moreover, organization officials, customers, technical personnel, and other stakeholders are
creating pressures and demands for creative and dependable solutions to a growing range,
number, and severity of security and privacy concerns—solutions which can only be achieved by
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 2.  Learning Continuum
17
a class of professionals with expertise in system and information protection.  IT security
professionalization is rapidly becoming a “business competency” in the public and private
sectors.  
IT security professionalization criteria are outside the scope of this document.  The training
guidance in Chapter 4 can be used and sequenced by agencies on an individualized basis as a
cost-effective way to fill gaps in a given practitioner’s knowledge and prepare him/her for formal
education that may be needed for credentialing or other demonstrable measures of qualification
in IT security.
An IT security professional is one who integrates the principles of the IT security field in a
forward-looking manner to keep up with technology trends and their evolving security
implications.  At the “Training” level of the learning continuum, the specific knowledge and
skills acquired may become obsolete as technology changes.  The exploratory nature of education
differentiates it from training.  From this exploratory vantage point, advances in thought and
theory make their way into security practices taught in training programs.  The educated IT
security professional has the comprehensive grasp of the field required to take responsibility for
their further learning in an ever-changing environment.  
At the advanced level of IT security professionalization, such as that of an IT Security Program
Manager, an employee should be able to represent the organization and participate actively and
constructively in addressing interagency or cross-cutting issues and concerns.  Examples include
increasing the effectiveness of assurance techniques; developing security policy models; 
participating in symposia or workgroups; or contributing to, developing, or managing training
programs.
To reach the advanced level of IT security professionalization, completion of formal education in
the field is required.  With regard to formal education, organizational officials who appoint/
supervise IT security specialists should know two important points: first, a concentration or
major can be located in any of a number of departments or colleges—from business
administration to computer science; and second, regardless of where a concentration or major
may be placed in a given university, the program of study should incorporate a well-planned
infusion of communications technology, human/behavioral science, mathematics, computer
science, engineering, business ethics, and information law. 
2.3  Comparative Framework
As illustrated in the learning continuum, “Awareness” constitutes the point-of-entry for all
employees into the progression of IT security knowledge levels; the “Training” level, starting
with “Security Basics and Literacy,” then builds a wide range of security-related skills needed by
employees in several functional area categories; and the “Education” level is the capstone of the
learning continuum—creating expertise necessary for IT security specialists and professionals. 
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 2.  Learning Continuum
18
Thus, “In a training environment the employee is taught to use specific skills as part of exacting
job performance.  In an educational context the employee would be encouraged to examine and
evaluate not only skills and methods of work but fundamental operating principles and tenets
upon which job skills are based....”1
The distinction among the three levels is not always easy to interpret and apply.  Exhibit 2-2,
below, illustrates this distinction.

2.4  Learning Styles and Effective Teaching Methods 
Exhibit 2-2 illustrates learning objectives and examples of teaching methods at each level of the
Learning Continuum.  This section further develops the role and importance of teaching methods
relative to learning for users of this document who may not be training professionals.   The
Federal workforce is the intended audience for this guidance document, and it is not a single,
homogeneous entity.  Therefore, no uniform teaching approach, or set of materials, is
appropriate.  Course developers and trainers will need to select the training materials and
approaches that will best address the needs of given audiences in line with an organization’s
culture and requirements, as well as with individual student needs as outlined below.
2.4.1  Ways of Learning and Implications for Instruction
Individuals learn in different ways.  The learning approach most effective for a particular
individual is a function of their preferred learning style, education, and prior experience.  While a
discussion of learning theory is beyond the scope of this document, it is important for subject
matter specialists who may serve as instructors to know that students will not all take in and
process information in the same way.  Attention to these differences in the instructional process
is just as important as is attention to the subject matter itself.
Learning Style:  Individuals learn in several ways but each person, as part of their personality,
has a preferred or primary learning style. Instruction can positively or negatively affect a
student’s performance, depending on whether it is matched, or mismatched, with a student’s
preferred learning style.  In learning information or concepts, some students will do better
through reading (visual learning); others prefer to listen to a lecture (auditory learning); still
others need to participate in a discussion (kinesthetic or tactile learning) in order to refine and
finally grasp the material.  In learning practical skills, some students prefer “how-to” pictures or
diagrams (visual learning); others prefer to hear verbal instructions (auditory learning); still
others ignore directions and prefer to jump in and figure things out as they go along (kinesthetic
or tactile learning).   
Content specialists tend to make the mistake of equating teaching to telling.  They find out the
hard way that students who do not learn best through listening will tune out lectures and learn
little.  Being aware of learning style differences should motivate instructors to use a variety of
teaching approaches.  For example, instructors who physically move around the classroom, who
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 2.  Learning Continuum
20
plan silent reading as well as lecturing, who include small group problem-solving, large group
debate, brainstorming, blackboard diagraming and other visual aids will have something for
everyone and in so doing will eliminate the “yawn factor.”  The implications for courseware
developers is that there is substantial benefit in using flexible presentation formats (e.g., 
multimedia, searchable databases, text, graphics, simulations, team teaching, decision trees and
interactive learning).  A training program as a whole should ideally include a range of delivery
approaches.  These could include, in addition to classroom instruction and computer-based
instruction, such options as manuals and self-paced instruction books, videotapes, interactive
workshops with “hands-on” exercises, and one-on-one mentoring/coaching by senior staff.
Education and prior experience:    Materials developers and trainers should consider the likely
education and experience  of their target audience and adjust their presentation approach and
content accordingly.  An individual with an advanced degree will perceive and learn new
material in a manner that is different from an individual without a degree but who has extensive
on-the-job experience.  For example, individuals with more than 15 years of employment (e.g.,
an older audience) are less likely to be familiar with or comfortable with technology-oriented
teaching techniques.  However, if the target audience primarily consists of individuals who have
recently graduated from college or high school (e.g., a younger audience), then increasing the
proportion of material delivered through multimedia or computer-based instruction may be
appropriate, as today’s students are generally more experienced with these teaching approaches. 
The actual job functions of the target audience should also be considered when developing
training materials and selecting teaching methodologies.  For example, if instruction relating to
the IT security countermeasures of a network server is being presented to an audience of system
administrators, then a multi-day, hands-on approach might be most effective.  If the same
material is to be presented to a group of system designers, then a 2-hour lecture may be
sufficient. 
2.4.2  Additional Considerations for Adult Learning
Course developers and trainers should also be aware that adults have well established—not
formative—values, beliefs, and opinions.  Individuals have individual learning style preferences
and adults may have had differing education, varying years of experience, and a wealth of
previously learned information which they bring to the learning venue.  Adults relate new
information and knowledge to previously learned information, experiences, and
values—sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously—thus, misperception and miscom-
munication can occur unless instructors make the effort to draw students out.  This can be done
(at least in a classroom setting) by balancing the presentation of new material with student
sharing of relevant experiences.  Instructors can help to make connections between various
student opinions and ideas, while focusing class effort on integration of the new knowledge or
skill with respect to its application. 
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 2.  Learning Continuum
21
Team teaching, if that is an option, can leverage individual instructor’s respective skills in this
regard.  In any case, the involvement of adult students as resources can help overcome potential 
problems associated with classes composed of workforce students with differing levels of
subject-matter knowledge.  Otherwise, instructors who rely on giving a lecture of the material
risk finding themselves over the heads of beginners, while boring or talking down to students
who are at more advanced levels.  
Finally, adult students, more so than their younger counterparts, learn best when they perceive
the relevance of the knowledge or skill to their current job or to their career advancement.  
When the instructor is able to emphasize the applicability and practical purpose of the material to
be mastered, as distinguished from abstract or conceptual learning, the learning retention rates
and the subsequent transference of the new knowledge or skill to the students’ jobs and
organizational settings will be enhanced.

CHAPTER 3.  SECURITY BASICS AND LITERACY
  
3.1  Definition and Purpose
The Security Basics and Literacy level on the learning continuum is the transition between
awareness and training.  To draw an analogy with reading literacy, "awareness" is equivalent to
reading readiness, whereby the child learns to recognize and memorize the letters of the alphabet. 
Then, at the transitional level, the child learns to use the alphabet and principles of grammar and
sentence structure to read and become literate.  The ability to read is the foundation for further,
specific learning.  So, too, are Security Basics and Literacy the foundation for further specific
learning related to one’s role(s) with respect to IT systems.
IT Security literacy must not be confused with the term “computer literacy,” which refers to an
individual’s familiarity with a basic set of knowledge needed to use a computer.  IT Security
literacy refers to an individual’s familiarity with—and ability to apply—a core knowledge set
(i.e., “IT security basics”) needed to protect electronic information and systems.  Just as
computer literacy is a generic foundation, i.e., is not geared to specific technology or
application(s), so, too, is security literacy a one-size-fits-all foundation for further learning; it is
not geared to any specific system.  All individuals who use computer technology or its output
products, regardless of their specific job responsibilities, must know IT security basics and be
able to apply them.
The next step beyond IT Security Basics and Literacy is to focus individuals’ ongoing learning on
their respective job functions and the system(s) they are involved with.  That focusing step or
stage constitutes the beginning level of specific, role-based IT security training, and is covered in
Chapter 4, Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training.  In Chapter 4,
“beginning”  refers to the beginning of IT security skills training, a logical segue from the
knowledge base established here.
      
The Security Basics and Literacy level has the following learning objectives:
C
To ensure that the student knows the “alphabet,” i.e., a core set of key terms and essential
concepts which comprises IT security and is essential for the protection of information
and systems.  (Many of the terms and concepts should have been previously introduced to
the learner in an agency's awareness briefings or activities.  In that case, Security Basics
and Literacy properly provides reinforcement and structure.)
C
To establish the principles for “reading” or “using the alphabet.” 
C
To promote personal responsibility and positive behavioral change.
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 3.  Security Basics and Literacy
26
C
To offer a curriculum framework to promote consistency across government.
These objectives are designed to permit a consistent, government-wide approach to ensure that
all employees who are involved with IT systems—regardless of agency, organizational unit, job
function(s), or specific system(s)—acquire the same, comprehensive literacy in security basics. 
The value of a consistent training program is the portability of security literacy as employees
change jobs and organizations.
3.2  Basics — Core Set of IT Security Terms and Concepts 
The body of knowledge associated with IT security is large and growing at an increasing rate,
commensurate with today’s rapid technological changes.  Regardless of its size and growth rate,
certain basic concepts form the foundation of any effective IT security program and environment. 
These terms and concepts must be learned and applied as the individual proceeds from security
awareness to training and then to education.
The core set of IT security terms and concepts is presented in this section as the “ABC’s of
Information Technology Security,” 26 items related to the alphabet, as summarized in Exhibit 3-
1 on the next page and described briefly in Exhibit 3-2.  This memory tool approach aids the
learning process while communicating fundamental IT security concepts.  It is anticipated that
course material developed under this model will build on the memory tool approach to learning.

IT Security ABC’s — Terms and Concepts
C
Assets — Assets are something of value that requires protection.  The value of an asset may be
monetary or non-monetary.  For example, a computer system clearly has a monetary value that
may be expressed in terms of its cost of acquisition or replacement.  Data, however, is an asset
that may have a monetary value (the cost to acquire), a non-monetary value (loss of public
confidence regarding data accuracy), or both.
 
C
Backup — Backup for data and/or processes are critical safeguards in any IT security
environment.  The concept of backup includes creation and testing of disaster recovery and
continuity of operations plans as well as preparation of copies of data files that are stored “out
of harm’s way.”
 
C
Countermeasures and Controls — Countermeasures, controls, and safeguards are terms that are
often used synonymously.  They refer to the procedures and techniques used to prevent the
occurrence of a security incident, detect when an incident is occurring or has occurred, and
provide the capability to respond to or recover from a security incident.  A safeguard may be a
password for a user identifier, a backup plan that provides for offsite storage of copies of
critical files, audit trails that allow association of specific actions to individuals, or any of a
number of other technical or procedural techniques.  Basically, a safeguard is intended to
protect the assets and availability of IT systems.
 
C
DAA and Other Officials — Individuals are responsible for allocating resources.  Resources
may be allocated to address IT security issues or any of a number of other competing
organizational needs.  The individual who has such authority for a specific IT system may be
termed a Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA), Approving Authority, Authorizing Official,
Recommending Official, or other titles specific to an organization.  Whatever the title, the
individual who has the authority to allocate resources is also responsible for balancing risks and
costs and accepting any residual risks in making those decisions.  The accrediting authorities
are often helped in these decisions by certifying authorities who provide assessments of the
technical adequacy of the current security environment and recommendations for resolving
deficiencies or weaknesses.
 
C
Ethics — the body of rules that governs an individual’s behavior.  It is a product of that
individual’s life experiences and forms a basis for deciding what is right and wrong when
making decisions.  In today’s environment, ethics are, unfortunately, situational (i.e., an
individual’s definition of what is right and wrong changes depending on the nature of a
particular situation).  For example, an individual may believe that it is wrong to break into
someone’s house, but does not think that it is wrong to break into someone’s computer system.

IT Security ABC’s — Terms and Concepts   (Continued)
C
Firewalls and Separation of Duties — Firewalls and separation of duties have similar structures
and complementary objectives: a firewall is a technical safeguard that provides separation
between activities, systems, or system components so that a security failure or weakness in one
is contained and has no impact on other activities or systems (e.g., enforcing separation of the
Internet from a Local Area Network).   Separation of duties similarly provides separation, but
its objective is to ensure that no single individual (acting alone) can compromise an application. 
In both cases, procedural and technical safeguards are used to enforce a basic security policy
that high risk activities should be segregated from low risk activities and that one person should
not be able to compromise a system.
C
Goals — The goals of an IT security program can be summarized in three words:
confidentiality - data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure; integrity - IT systems
must not permit processes or data to be changed without authorization; and availability -
authorized access to IT systems must be assured.
C
Hackers/Crackers — The term “hacker” was originally coined to apply to individuals who
focused on learning all they could about IT, often to the exclusion of many other facets of life
(including sleeping and eating).  A “cracker” is any individual who uses advanced knowledge
of networks or the Internet to compromise network security. Typically, when the traditional
hacker compromised the security of an IT system, the objective was academic (i.e., a learning
exercise), and any resulting damage or destruction was unintentional.  Currently, the term
hacker is being more widely used to describe any individual who attempts to compromise the
security of an IT system, especially those whose intention is to cause disruption or obtain
unauthorized access to data.  Hacker/cracker activity generally gets high press coverage even
though more mundane security incidents caused by unintentional actions of authorized users
tend to cause greater disruption and loss.
C
Individual Accountability/Responsibility — A basic tenet of IT security is that individuals must
be accountable for their actions.  If this is not followed and enforced, it is not possible to
successfully prosecute those who intentionally damage or disrupt systems, or to train those
whose actions have unintended adverse effects.  The concept of individual accountability drives
the need for many security safeguards such as user identifiers, audit trails, and access
authorization rules.
C
Job Description/Job Function — To provide individuals with the training necessary to do their
job, and to establish appropriate safeguards to enforce individual accountability, it is necessary
to know what functions an individual is authorized to perform (i.e., their role(s) within the
organization).  Some times this is accomplished using formalized/written job descriptions.  In
other situations, such assessments are based on analysis of the functions performed.

Exhibit 3-2
IT Security ABC’s — Terms and Concepts  (Continued)
C
Keys to Incident Prevention — Many IT security incidents are preventable if individuals
incorporate three basic concepts into their day-to-day activities: one, awareness - individuals
should be aware of the value of the assets they use to do their job and the nature of associated
threats and vulnerabilities; two, compliance - individuals should comply with established
safeguards (e.g., scanning diskettes, changing passwords, performing backups); and three,
common sense - if something appears too good to be true, it generally is.
C
Laws and Regulations — Congress has enacted a number of laws (e.g., Privacy Act, Computer
Security Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) that establish the basic policy structure for IT
security in the Federal government.  These laws have been augmented with regulations and
guidance regarding their applicability to IT systems.  Private industry generally grounds its
security policies on the impact on profitability and potential risk of lawsuits, as there are few
specific legal requirements.  The commonality between Federal and private IT security
programs demonstrates that the objectives are the same whether the impetus was a law or the
bottom line.
 
C
Model Framework — This document presents a model framework for IT security training.  The
model framework describes individual training needs relative to job function or role within the
organization.  The model recognizes that an individual’s need for IT security training will
change, both in scope and depth, relative to their organizational responsibilities.
C
Need to Know — Need to Know is addressed from two perspectives: first, a need for access to
information to do a job; and second, need to know as a driver for continued learning.  In the
first case, access to information and processes should be restricted to that which the individual
requires to do their job.  This approach minimizes the potential for unauthorized activities, and
maximizes the potential that the individual knows and understands the nature of the threats and
vulnerabilities associated with their use or maintenance of an IT system; and second, given the
rate of technological change, individuals need to know the characteristics of those technologies
so they may be better able to address specific vulnerabilities.
C
Ownership — Responsibility for the security of an IT system or asset must be assigned to a
single, identifiable entity, and to a single, senior official within that entity.  This provides for
accountability for security failures and establishment of the chain of command that authorizes
access to and use of system assets.  This concept of individual responsibility and authority is
generally termed ownership or stewardship.  The ownership of an asset (particularly data) is
generally retained, even when that asset is transferred to another organization.  For example, tax
data shared with other Federal and state agencies by the Internal Revenue Service must be
secured in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.

Chapter 3.  Security Basics and Literacy
31
Exhibit 3-2
IT Security ABC’s — Terms and Concepts    (Continued)
C
Policies and Procedures — IT security safeguards are intended to achieve specific control
objectives.  These objectives are contained within security policies that should be tailored
to the needs of each IT system. Procedures define the technical and procedural safeguards
that have been implemented to enforce the specified policies.  IT security procedures may
be documented in a security plan.
C
Quality Assurance/Quality Control — Quality Assurance and Quality Control are two
processes that are used to ensure the consistency and integrity of security safeguards.
Specifically, these processes are intended to ensure that security countermeasures perform
as specified, under all workload and operating conditions.
C
Risk Management — Risk management is the process whereby the threats, vulnerabilities,
and potential impacts from security incidents are evaluated against the cost of safeguard
implementation.  The objective of Risk Management is to ensure that all IT assets are
afforded reasonable protection against waste, fraud, abuse, and disruption of operations. 
Risk Management is growing in importance as the scope of potential threats is growing
while available resources are declining.
C
Security Training — Security training is the sum of the processes used to impart the body
of knowledge associated with IT security to those who use, maintain, develop, or manage
IT systems.  A well trained staff can often compensate for weak technical and procedural
safeguards.  Security training has been demonstrated to have the greatest return on
investment of any technical or procedural IT security safeguard.
C
Threats — Threats are actions or events (intentional or unintentional) which, if realized,
will result in waste, fraud, abuse, or disruption of operations.  Threats are always present,
and the rate of threat occurrence can not be controlled.  IT security safeguards, therefore,
must be designed to prevent or minimize any impact on the affected IT system.
C
Unique Identifiers — A unique identifier is a code or set of codes that provide a positive
association between authorities and actions to individuals.  Safeguards must be in place to
ensure that an identifier is used only by the individual to whom it is assigned.
C
Vulnerabilities — Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in an IT system’s security environment. 
Threats may exploit or act through a vulnerability to adversely affect the IT system. 
Safeguards are used to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities.
C
Waste, Fraud, and Abuse — Waste, fraud, and abuse are potential adverse impacts that may
result from a breakdown in IT security.  Waste, fraud, and abuse are specifically identified
as potential impacts in government-wide policy.
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 3.  Security Basics and Literacy
32
Exhibit 3-2
IT Security ABC’s — Terms and Concepts    (Continued)
C
eXpect the uneXpected — IT security safeguards target unauthorized actions. 
Unauthorized actions (acts by individuals or Acts-of-God) can take many forms and can
occur at any time.  Thus, security safeguards should be sufficiently flexible to identify and
respond to any activity that deviates from a pre-defined set of acceptable actions.
C
You — You are responsible and will be held accountable for your actions relative to an IT
system or its associated data.  You can strengthen or weaken an IT security environment by
your actions or inactions.  For example, you can strengthen an IT environment by changing
passwords at appropriate intervals and weaken it by failing to do so.
C
Zoning/Compartmenting — Zoning/Compartmenting is a concept whereby an application is
segmented into independent security environments.  A breach of security would require a
security failure in two or more zones/compartments before the application is compromised. 
This layered approach to security can be applied within physical or technical environments
associated with an IT system.
3.3  Literacy —  Curriculum Framework
The literacy level is the first solid step of the IT security training level, where the knowledge
obtained through training can be directly related to the individual’s role in his or her specific
organization.  Although the curriculum framework, presented below, provides a generic outline
for material to be included in literacy training throughout government, it is imperative that the
instructor relate the actual course content to the organization’s unique culture and mission
requirements.  Emphasis placed on the specific topics may vary by student audience or
organization needs.  The curriculum framework was developed to present topics and concepts in
a logical order, based on IT system planning and life cycle stages, but may be presented in any
order.  Literacy training may also be divided into more than one session.  Regardless of the
training method or structure used, it is expected that the actual literacy training, including all
topics and concepts in the curriculum framework, can be completed within an 8-hour time frame. 
This is because, at the literacy level, the material should be presented as an introduction of the
concepts and topics only.   
There are a variety of suitable approaches for teaching this subject matter.  One of the most
effective is to encourage participation by the students in interactive discussions on how the
various concepts relate to their particular organization or roles.  This approach allows the
students to understand the significance of IT security principles and procedures to their
organization, and to begin finding ways of applying this new knowledge in their work
environment.

in the ABC’s, introduces a set of generic topics and concepts which have been identified as the
foundation for IT security training, and provides a mechanism for students to relate and apply the
information learned on the job.  In Chapter 4, a methodology for development of role-based

ROLE-BASED TRAINING
4.1  Introduction
The Learning Continuum presented in Chapter 2 shows the relationship among Awareness,
Security Basics and Literacy, Training, and Education.  The Continuum demonstrates that
Awareness and Security Basics and Literacy form the baseline which is required for all
individuals involved with the management, development, maintenance, and/or use of IT systems. 
It also demonstrates that Training and Education are to be provided selectively, based on
individual responsibilities and needs.  Specifically, Training is to be provided to individuals
based on their particular job functions.  Education is intended for designated IT security
specialists in addition to role-based training.  This chapter establishes a model and requirements
for the Roles and Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems layer of the Learning Continuum.
Over time, individuals acquire different roles relative to the use of IT within an organization, or
as they make a career move to a different organization.  Sometimes they will be users of
applications; in other instances they may be involved in developing a new system; and in some
situations they may serve on a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for IT
systems.  An individual’s need for IT security training changes as their roles change.  This is
recognized within the Learning Continuum by segmenting the Training level shown above into
six functional specialities which represent categories of generic organizational roles: Manage,
Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and Operate, Review and Evaluate, and Use.  A
seventh category, “Other,” is a place holder, to allow the matrix to be updated to accommodate
any additional functional roles identified in the future.
This chapter examines the six role categories relative to three fundamental training content
categories:
C
Laws and Regulations—the types of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) relative to
the laws and regulations pertaining to information and asset protection that govern the
management and use of IT within the Federal Government.  These include government-
wide requirements such as the Computer Security Act of 1987, policy promulgated by the
Office of Management and Budget, standards and guidance disseminated by NIST, as
well as policies and procedures specific to a Department or agency;
C
Security Program— KSAs relative to the establishment, implementation, and monitoring
of an IT Security Program within an organization; and
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 4.  Training Development Methodology
44
C
System Life Cycle Security— KSAs relative to the nature of IT security needed
throughout each phase of a given system’s life cycle.  In this instance, a six-phased
system life cycle model was used (Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
Implementation, Operations, and Termination).
Combining the six role categories and the three training areas (with a fourth area, “Other,” added
as a place holder for future use) yields the following Information Technology Security Training
Matrix, Exhibit 4-1, shown below.   This matrix is, in effect, a “pull-down menu” of the Training
level in the Learning Continuum.
Exhibit 4-1
IT Security Training Matrix
This chapter presents the training requirements for each of the 46 cells, i.e., 1A through 3.6E. 
(Bricked cells - particularly 3.1D, 3.3A, 3.3B, 3.6B, and 3.6C - are place holders, or cells that
may be used later.)  This approach will enable course developers to create a block or module of
instructional material relative to the requirements defined in a specific cell with confidence that it
will complement and augment training material developed for the other cells.  Further,
individuals or supervisors will be able to select that training needed to satisfy an individual’s
organizational role at a specific point in time, with assurance that such training will contribute to
his or her career progression, or to other assigned duties.  Finally, trainers will have the flexibility
to combine modules (horizontally or vertically) into a comprehensive IT security course or to

insert one or more of the security modules into a training course for one of the functional
specialties, such as management, acquisitions, or auditing.
Each cell of the IT Security Training Matrix is detailed in a one-page table, which has the format
of the table shown in Exhibit 4-2.  Explanation of the cell contents follows:

and Functional Specialty (Role) addressed.
 
C
Definition — Defines the training content area addressed.
 
C
Behavioral Outcome — Describes what an individual who has completed the specific
training module is expected to be able to accomplish in terms of IT security-related job
performance.    
 
C
Knowledge Levels — Provides verbs that describe actions an individual should be
capable of performing on the job after completion of the training associated with the cell. 
The verbs are identified for three training levels: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced.
 
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 4.  Training Development Methodology
46
C
Sample Learning Objectives — Links the verbs from the “Knowledge Levels” section to
the “Behavioral Outcomes” by providing examples of the activities an individual should
be capable of doing after successful completion of training associated with the cell. 
Again, the Learning Objectives recognize that training must be provided at Beginning,
Intermediate, and Advanced levels.  For some of the cells, there will not be three distinct
levels (i.e., there may be only two levels or even one).  In these instances, there is no clear
distinction between performance objectives that allows separation into Beginning,
Intermediate, and Advanced levels. (Note: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced refer
to levels of IT security responsibility associated with the functional area, not to levels of
the functional area as such.  For example, an experienced (Advanced level) IT system
developer could be taking entry-level (Beginning) training in the IT security
responsibilities associated with the system development function.)
    
The purpose of the Beginning Level is to focus the generic understanding of IT security,
which the individual will have acquired from Security Basics and Literacy (per Chapter
3), on their job requirements.
 
C
Sample Job Functions — Presents sample position titles or job functions of individuals
who would be expected to obtain the training for a particular cell.  Individuals designated
as IT Security specialists need to be acquainted with the training content in all cells,
whether or not they themselves need training in a specific programmatic role (e.g.,
responsibility for selecting a back-up site for a specific IT system).  An aggregate of 26
Sample Job Functions for all cells is presented as Exhibit 4-3, together with the number
of cells in which each occurs.   It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible
job functions.  Appendix E, Job Function-Training Cross Reference, contains tables that
show the recommended training modules (cells) for each of these 26 job functions. 
 
C
IT Security Body of Knowledge Topics and Concepts — This block (on the back of the
page for each cell),  provides suggested topics and concepts which pertain to the
particular cell or training module that will increase the knowledge, skills, and abilities of
the student.  The numbers on the back of the cell page refer to Exhibit 4-4, which presents
twelve high-level topics and concepts intended to incorporate the overall body of
knowledge required for training in IT security.  Each of these topics and concepts is then
broken down into more specific subjects that should be included in the training for that
topic.  By identifying the twelve topics and concepts at a high level, they become general
and flexible categories under which more specific topics or subjects can be added or
removed to keep up with evolving technology, laws, regulations, policies, or guidance.
  
To customize the training in a cell, topics and detailed subjects may be presented at
different depths to accomplish the desired learning objective level (i.e., Beginning,
Intermediate, and Advanced).  For example, if an individual has no acquisition
responsibilities and therefore, no need for in-depth training in acquisition, that topic
might be introduced, but not explained in depth.   Thus, the student would become
familiar with the associated IT security considerations, but would not learn how to write
Information Technology Security Training Requirements

detailed IT security requirements for a statement of work.  In addition, the content may be
modified for specific organization or system reasons.  The listed topics and concepts are
not intended to be absolute, and creators of the actual training courses will be expected
to review the suggested topics for each cell and revise them as appropriate.

model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
Implementation, Operations, and Termination.  Life cycle security is the
ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.
The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.
Behavioral Outcome — Individuals with acquisition responsibilities are able to understand
the IT security concerns associated with system operations and to
identify and use the appropriate contract vehicle to meet current
needs in a timely manner.

CHAPTER 5.  EVALUATING TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS
Evaluate: “To determine or fix the value of; to examine carefully”3
5.1  Value of Evaluation in a Training Program
Evaluating training effectiveness is a vital step to ensure that the training delivered is meaningful. 
Training is “meaningful” only when it meets the needs of both the student (employee) and the
organization.  If  training content is incorrect, outdated, or inappropriate for the audience, the
training will not meet student or organizational needs.  If the delivery vehicle (e.g., classroom or
computer-based training) is inappropriate, either in relation to the simplicity/complexity of the
content or to the type of audience—or if there is an inadequate mix of vehicles in an agency’s
overall training program—the training will not meet needs.  Spending time and resources on
training that does not achieve desired effects can reinforce, rather than dispel, the perception of
security as an obstacle to productivity.  Further, it can require the expenditure of far more
resources in data or system recovery after a security incident occurs than would have been spent
in prevention activities.  
All meaningless training is expensive, even where the direct cost outlay, or cost-per-student, may
be low.   Because agencies cannot afford to waste limited resources on ineffective training,
evaluation of training effectiveness should become an integral component of an agency’s IT
security training program.  A robust training evaluation effort may be the second most effective
vehicle for garnering management support for IT security—the first being the occurrence of a
serious security incident.    
In broader context, attention to IT security training evaluation is in line with a changing focus in
the overall field of information technology regarding how results of systems efforts are measured. 
The focus is beginning to change from being solely a machine view, i.e., measuring the
functionality of the technology (e.g., speed, gigabytes), to encompass a people view, i.e., the
functionality of the people who use the technology.  Thus, in organizations where it is recognized
that system utility is affected—or even determined—by users, it becomes apparent that to
achieve its full utility, a percentage of the system budget must be devoted to people needs such as
training.4

Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness

5.2  Purposes of Training Effectiveness Evaluation 
Meaningfulness, or effectiveness, requires measurement.   Evaluating training effectiveness has
four distinct but interrelated purposes—to measure:  
C
The extent to which conditions were right for learning and the learner’s subjective
satisfaction;
C
What a given student has learned from a specific course or training event, i.e., learning
effectiveness;
C
A pattern of student outcomes following a specific course or training event; i.e., teaching
effectiveness; and
C
The value of the specific class or training event, compared to other options in the context
of an agency’s overall IT security training program; i.e., program effectiveness.
An evaluation process should produce four types of measurement, each related to one of
evaluation’s four purposes, as appropriate for three types of users of evaluation data:
C
First, evaluation should yield information to assist the employees themselves in assessing
their subsequent on-the-job performance.  
C
Second, evaluation should yield information to assist the employees’ supervisors in
assessing individual students’ subsequent on-the-job performance.
C
Third, it should produce trend data to assist trainers in improving both learning and
teaching.  
C
Finally,  it should produce return-on-investment statistics to enable responsible officials
to allocate limited resources in a thoughtful, strategic manner among the spectrum of IT
security awareness, security literacy, training, and education options for optimal results
among the workforce as a whole.  
5.3  Development of an Evaluation Plan
It is difficult to get “good” information for each of evaluation’s four purposes (above).  It is
impossible to do so without planning for evaluation.  To evaluate student learning, it is first
necessary to have written learning objectives, stated in an observable, measurable way as
behavioral outcomes: in short, “behavioral objectives.”  To evaluate teaching, it is necessary to
plan for the collection of trend data, evaluation, and extrapolation. To evaluate return on
investment, mission-related goals must be explicitly identified to which the learning objectives
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness
159
are related.  Thus, to obtain “good” information in each of these areas, the process of course
development should include the development of an evaluation plan.  The remainder of this
section provides guidance in the development of an evaluation plan.
5.3.1  Behavioral Objectives
The major components of behavioral objectives are: Conditions of Activity, Activity to be
Performed, and Level of Success.  There are several “schools” of behavioral objectives among
educational theorists; however, most agree with the three components, described below.
C Conditions of Activity
This is a written description of existing conditions prior to, and in preparation for,  the
learning activity.  A “snowstorm” metaphor is illustrative.  For meteorologists to forecast
the arrival of  a snowstorm, certain conditions must exist: e.g., relative humidity at a certain
level, air temperature, conducive atmospheric conditions.  Similarly, certain conditions must
be present to forecast training effectiveness.  Does the student need a checklist, a set of
items to manipulate, or an outline of the information?  Does the instructor need audiovisual
equipment, handouts, or a classroom with furniture set up in a specific format?  Conditions
of the learning activity, including computer-based training (CBT), not just “platform”
training, must be specific and comprehensive.  Keep in mind that if just one of the
conditions for a snowstorm is missing, the storm either will not arrive or its force will be
diminished.  So, too, with learning.
C Activity to be Performed
The evaluation plan must state the activity to be performed in a manner permitting the
evaluator to actually observe the behavior that the student is to learn—whether observable
in class (teacher as evaluator) or back on the job (supervisor as evaluator).  It is difficult, if
not impossible, to measure the process of a student changing an attitude or thinking through
a task or problem.   The evaluator, however, can measure a written exercise, a skill
demonstration, a verbal or written pronouncement, or any combination of these outwardly
demonstrable activities.  He/she cannot take the student’s word for the learned skill, or the
simple fact that the student was present and exposed to the skill or information being taught.
Rather, the evaluator must observe the skill being performed or the information being
applied.  (With CBT, evaluation measurement can be programmed to occur at the
instructional block level, with subsequent blocks adjusted based on student response.  With
platform training, adjustments can be made in real time by the instructor based on the nature
of student questions during the course.  Adjustments can also be made between courses in a
student’s training sequence.)
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness
160
C Level of Success
Measures of success should be derived from the individual’s normal work products rather
than from classroom testing.  This directly ties the individual’s performance to its impact on
the organization’s mission.  Written behavioral objectives for a learning activity must
include a stated level of success.   For quantitative skills, must the learner perform
successfully every time, or 10 out of 100 times, or 5 out of 10 times in terms of performance
requirements or consequences?  Risk management requirements should be used to establish
the criticality of quantitative skills.  For qualitative skills, what distinguishes satisfactory
performance from failure, or outstanding performance from satisfactory?   Measurements of
qualitative skills might include the amount of re-work required, customer satisfaction, or
peer recognition of the employee as a source of IT security information.
The nature and purpose of the training activity, and whether it is at a beginning,
intermediate, or advanced level, will influence the setting of success measures—a subjective
goal.  If success levels are not documented, an individual student’s achievement of the
behavioral objectives of the learning activity can not be evaluated, nor can the learning
activity itself be evaluated within an organization’s overall training program.
In addition to the written objectives suggested above, the evaluation plan should show how the
data to be collected are to be used to support the cost and effort of the data collection.  This can
be related to levels of evaluation, presented below.
5.3.2  Levels of Evaluation 
Four levels of evaluation, in order of complexity, are:
C
Level 1:  End-of-Course Evaluations  (Student Satisfaction)
C
Level 2:  Behavior Objective Testing  (Learning Effectiveness, which is also a measure of
Teaching Effectiveness)
C
Level 3:  Job Transfer Skills  (Performance Effectiveness)
C
Level 4: Organizational Benefit  (Training Program Effectiveness)
Altogether, the four levels match the four purposes of training evaluation (described in Section
5.2) in a staged manner.  These levels are as follows.
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness
161
Level 1:  End-of-Course Evaluations  (Student Satisfaction)
A common term for this type of evaluation is “the ‘Smiley Face’ evaluation.”  Likert Scale-
type forms ask the student to check a range of options from “poor” to “excellent” (or vice
versa) to indicate how he/she felt about the class, the computer-based courseware, or whatever
the learning activity was.  The response data is an indicator of how the learning activity is
received by the student.   The responses also reveal if the conditions for learning were correct. 
Some of the questions in this level of evaluation ask about the student’s satisfaction with the
training facility and instructor (if classroom training), the manner of presentation of the
content, and whether or not course objectives were met in relation to the student’s
expectations.  Although this type of evaluation does not provide in-depth data, it does provide
rapid feedback from the learner’s perspective.
Measurement of training effectiveness depends on an understanding of the background and
skill level of the training audience.  For example, technical training provided to an audience of
systems analysts and programmers will have a different level of effect than that provided to an
audience of accountants.  Basic demographic data may be collected at either course
commencement or conclusion, but information regarding the learners’ satisfaction with the
course and course material should be collected at the end of the course.
Level 2:  Behavior Objective Testing  (Learning and Teaching Effectiveness)
This level of evaluation measures how much information or skill was transmitted from the
training activity to the learner.  The evaluation should be in various formats relative to the
level of training.  In an IT Security Basics and Literacy course, for example, participants could
be given a pre-test and a post-test of multiple choice items or fill-in-the-blank statements.  At
an intermediate or advanced training level, participants should be given some sort of
performance test, such as a case study to solve.  At the education level, essay questions
exploring concepts would be appropriate.  The evaluation format must relate back to the
behavioral objectives of the learning activity which, in turn, drive the content being presented. 
The Level 2 evaluation also provides instant feedback, but it is more objective than a Level 1
evaluation: it assesses how much the student remembered or demonstrated by skill
performance by the end of the program—not how he/she felt about it.  As previously noted, 
Level 2 evaluation can be built into each block of instruction and does not need to wait until
the end of a course.
A Level 2 evaluation measures success in transference of information and skills to the student. 
It enables the evaluator to determine if a given student may need to repeat the course, or
perhaps attend a different type of learning activity presenting the same material in a different
format.  The evaluator should be able to see if a pattern of transference problems emerges, and
determine whether or not the course itself may need to be reconfigured or perhaps dropped
from an organization’s training program.
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness
162
Behavior objective testing is possibly the most difficult measurement area to address.  It is
relatively easy to test the knowledge level of the attendees after completing a course or block
of instruction but it is not easy to determine when that learning took place.  An attendee may
have had knowledge of the subject area before receiving the instruction so that the course had
little or no impact.  Thus, information collected solely at the conclusion of a
course/instructional block must be examined relative to the attendee’s background and
education.
To better determine the learning impact of a specific course or instructional block, an
approach is to use pre/post testing in which testing is performed at the outset, and the results
are compared to testing conducted at the conclusion of instruction. 
Testing of an attendee’s knowledge of a particular subject area by including questions or tasks
where there is a single right answer or approach is appropriate for almost all testing situations,
especially at the beginning and intermediate levels.  Questions regarding selection of the
“best” answer among possible options should be reserved for those training environments
where there is opportunity for analysis regarding why a particular answer is better than other
answers. 
Level 3:  Job Transfer Skills  (Student Performance Effectiveness)
This evaluation is the first level which asks for more than student input.  At this level, the
evaluator, through a structured questionnaire usually administered 30 to 60 days following the
training activity, asks the supervisor about the performance of the employee(s) relative to the
behavioral objectives of the course.  This is a “before” and “after” job skills comparison.  In
some cases this information is difficult to obtain, especially when employees’ job functions
and grade levels permit them considerable autonomy, without direct supervision.   When
supervisors observe only the final output of employee actions, developing a valid
questionnaire can present a particular challenge.  When accomplished successfully, a Level 3
evaluation should begin to show the extent to which the learning activity benefits the
organization as well as the employee.
Questions appropriate for the learner’s supervisor might include:
C Has the learner used the knowledge obtained in the course to accomplish job tasks?
C Has the learner’s performance improved since taking the course?     
Level 4:  Organizational Benefit  (Training Program Effectiveness)
Level 4 evaluations can be difficult to undertake and hard to quantify.  They can involve
structured, follow-up interviews with students, their supervisors, and colleagues.  They can
Information Technology Security Training Requirements
Chapter 5.  Evaluating Training Effectiveness
163
involve comparison by a subject-matter expert of outputs produced by a student both before
and after training.  They can involve some form of benchmarking, or evaluation of the
particular training activity in relation to other options for a particular job performance
measure.   In all cases they involve quantifying the value of resulting improvement in relation
to the cost of training.  Level 4 evaluations,  properly designed, can help senior management
officials to answer such hypothetical questions as: “Is it more cost-effective to devote limited
training resources to the education of a single, newly-appointed IT security specialist in this
organization, or to devote the same resources to security basics and literacy training of all
employees in the organization?”; or “Is it a better return on investment to train ‘front-end’
systems designers and developers in building  security rules commensurate with the sensitivity
of the system, or to train ‘back-end’ users in compliance with currently existing system rules?” 
Determination of the purpose and objectives of a Level 4 evaluation, as well as the number of
variables and the method of measurement of skill level, should only be done following
completion of  Level 3 evaluation(s), utilizing the findings thereof.
5.4  Implementation of Evaluation Planning
The information in Exhibit 5-1 should help in starting a comprehensive evaluation effort of an
organization’s IT security training program.  Each cell suggests the overall skill objective which
should be attained by the cell evaluator (e.g., instructor, or the student’s supervisor, as
appropriate) and/or the overall program evaluator with respect to the various types of learning
programs.  Each cell also produces a variety of specific information and requires different tools. 
Because of the vast amount of data collected, evaluation tools usually consist of a series of
questions which require response on a Likert-type scale.   This scale, from one to five (one being
very good; five being not good, or vice versa), allows the evaluator to prioritize the usefulness of
the overall training program and the specific courses or learning events or components within it. 
Each tool is program- and site-specific. 
A practical method to use is to choose a starting point in Exhibit 5-1, beginning with a type of
training the organization currently offers; then find an evaluation tool appropriate to a cell at that
level and borrow or adapt the concepts presented from already-developed tools.  Samples of
some of these evaluation tools appear as Exhibits 5-2 and 5-3.  Agency training staff may be able
to help locate other tools.

5.5  Summary
Evaluation is undertaken to measure the effectiveness of an agency’s or organization’s IT
security training program, i.e., the extent to which the overall program and its respective
components are either meaningful or a waste of the organization’s limited training resources. 
The employee (student) must be asked their view of each learning event (Level 1 and Level 2),
the supervisor their view of the event (Level 3), and the organization its view of the event (Level
4) in relation to return on investment.  In this process, both quantitative and qualitative data will
be collected.  At Levels 3 and 4, data collection will be longitudinal.  As important as it is for the
evaluator to collect the raw data, analysis and application of the collected data is where the IT
Security Program Manager and senior officials get the organization’s money’s worth out of its IT
security training program.  Evaluation planning in advance of the event(s) to be evaluated is
essential.
To assist in this regard, Exhibit 5-4 on the following page illustrates and correlates the elements
of training effectiveness evaluation that have been discussed in this chapter, i.e., the four
purposes of evaluation and four types of data needed for measurement (from section 5.2), the
three behavioral objectives (from subsection 5.3.1), and the four levels of evaluation (from
subsection 5.3.2) along with the evaluation tools or instruments associated with each level (from
section 5.4).

NISTTechnical Publications
Periodical
Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology—Reports NIST research
and development in those disciplines of the physical and engineering sciences in which the Institute is
active. These include physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences. Papers cover a
broad range of subjects, with major emphasis on measurement methodology and the basic technology
underlying standardization. Also included from time to time are survey articles on topics closely related to
the Institute’s technical and scientific programs. Issued six times a year.
Nonperiodicals
Monographs—Major contributions to the technical literature on various subjects related to the
Institute’s scientific and technical activities.
Handbooks—Recommended codes of engineering and industrial practice (including safety codes) devel-
oped in cooperation with interested industries, professional organizations, and regulatory bodies.
Special Publications—Include proceedings of conferences sponsored by NIST, NIST annual reports, and
other special publications appropriate to this grouping such as wall charts, pocket cards, and bibliographies.
National Standard Reference Data Series—Provides quantitative data on the physical and chemical
properties of materials, compiled from the world’s literature and critically evaluated. Developed under a
worldwide program coordinated by NIST under the authority of the National Standard Data Act (Public
Law 90-396). NOTE: The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data (JPCRD) is published
bimonthly for NIST by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP).
Subscriptions, reprints, and supplements are available from ACS, 1155 Sixteenth St., NW, Washington, DC
20056.
Building Science Series—Disseminates technical information developed at the Institute on building
materials, components, systems, and whole structures. The series presents research results, test methods, and
performance criteria related to the structural and environmental functions and the durability and safety
characteristics of building elements and systems.
Technical Notes—Studies or reports which are complete in themselves but restrictive in their treatment of
a subject. Analogous to monographs but not so comprehensive in scope or definitive in treatment of the
subject area. Often serve as a vehicle for final reports of work performed at NIST under the sponsorship of
other government agencies.
Voluntary Product Standards—Developed under procedures published by the Department of Commerce
in Part 10, Title 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standards establish nationally recognized
requirements for products, and provide all concerned interests with a basis for common understanding of
the characteristics of the products. NIST administers this program in support of the efforts of private-sector
standardizing organizations.
Order the following NIST publications—FIPS and NISTIRs—from the National Technical Information
Service, Springfield, VA 22161.
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB)—Publications in this series
collectively constitute the Federal Information Processing Standards Register. The Register serves as the
official source of information in the Federal Government regarding standards issued by NIST pursuant to
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended, Public Law 89-306 (79 Stat.
1127), and as implemented by Executive Order 11717 (38 FR 12315, dated May 11, 1973) and Part 6 of
Title 15 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).
NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIR)—The series includes interim or final reports on work
performed by NIST for outside sponsors (both government and nongovernment). In general, initial
distribution is handled by the sponsor; public distribution is handled by sales through the National Technical
Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161, in hard copy, electronic media, or microfiche form. NISTIR’s
may also report results of NIST projects of transitory or limited interest, including those that will be
published subsequently in more comprehensive form.
