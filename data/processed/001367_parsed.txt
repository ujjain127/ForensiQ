Self-Regulatory Organizations; 
American Stock Exchange LLC; Notice 
of Filing and Order Granting 
Accelerated Approval of Proposed 
Rule Change To Trade Currency Trust 
Shares of Seven Currency Trusts 
Pursuant to Unlisted Trading 
Privileges 
September 24, 2007. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Exchange Act’’) 1 and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,2 notice is hereby given that, 
on August 29, 2007, the American Stock 
Exchange LLC (the ‘‘Amex’’ or the 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’), the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which items have been 
substantially prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons, and is granting accelerated 
approval to the proposed rule change. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to trade 
shares (the ‘‘Shares’’) of the following 
trusts: (1) CurrencySharesSM Australian 
Dollar Trust; (2) CurrencySharesSM 
British Pound Sterling Trust; (3) 
CurrencySharesSM Canadian Dollar 
Trust; (4) CurrencySharesSM Japanese 
Yen Trust; (5) CurrencySharesSM 
Mexican Peso Trust; (6) 
CurrencySharesSM Swedish Krona Trust; 
and (7) CurrencySharesSM Swiss Franc 
Trust (each a ‘‘Trust’’ and collectively, 
the ‘‘Trusts’’) pursuant to unlisted 
trading privileges (‘‘UTP’’).3 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Amex’s Web site at 
http://www.amex.com, at the 
Exchange’s principal office, and at the 
Commission’s Public Reference Room. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change, and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item III below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, 
substantially set forth in Sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to trade the 
Shares of the Trusts under Amex Rule 
1200B–AEMI pursuant to UTP. Amex 
Rule 1200B–AEMI defines a Currency 
Trust Share as: ‘‘a security that (i) Is 
issued by a trust that holds a specified 
non-U.S. currency deposited with the 
trust; (ii) when aggregated in some 
specified minimum number may be 
surrendered to the trust by the 
beneficial owner to receive the specified 
non-U.S. currency; and (iii) pays 
beneficial owners interest and other 
distributions on the deposited non-U.S. 
currency, if any, declared and paid by 
the trust.’’ Further, Commentary .01 to 
Amex Rule 1200B–AEMI categorizes a 
Currency Trust Share as a Trust Issued 
Receipt that holds a specified non-U.S. 
currency or currencies deposited with 
the trust. Amex Rule 1201B entitled, 
Designation of an Underlying Foreign 
Currency, authorizes the Exchange to 
trade Currency Trust Shares pursuant to 
UTP. 
The Commission previously approved 
the listing and trading of the Shares on 
the New York Stock Exchange 
(‘‘NYSE’’) 4 and they are currently 
trading on the NYSE Arca Marketplace 
(‘‘NYSE Arca’’) pursuant to UTP.5 The 
Commission also previously approved 
the trading of the CurrencySharesSM 
Euro Trust (f/k/a Euro Currency Trust) 
on Amex, pursuant to UTP.6 Rydex 
Specialized Products LLC, d/b/a/ 
‘‘Rydex Investments,’’ is the sponsor of 
the Trusts (‘‘Sponsor’’) and is 
responsible for, among other things, 
overseeing the performance of The Bank 
of New York (‘‘Trustee’’) and the 
Trusts’’ principal service providers, 
including those that prepare the

7 The Web site also makes available a variety of 
other relevant information about the Currency Trust 
Shares including: the spot price for each applicable 
foreign currency; the daily FRB–NY Noon Buying 
Rate; premium/discount information, calculated on 
a 20-minute delay; and the Basket Amount for each 
applicable foreign currency, among other things. 
8 See supra note 4. 
9 The IIV is sometimes referred to as the intraday 
optimized portfolio value (‘‘IOPV’’). 
10 See Exchange Act Release No. 29063 (April 10, 
1991), 56 FR 15652 (April 17, 1991) at note 9, 
(noting the Exchange’s designation of equity 
derivative securities as eligible for such treatment 
under Rule 154, Commentary .04(c)). 
11 Amex has represented that it plans to submit 
a proposed rule filing to the Commission that will 
financial statements. The Trustee is 
responsible for the day-to-day operation 
of the Trusts. Additionally, the London 
branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
is the depository for the Trusts 
(‘‘Depository’’), and Rydex Distributors, 
Inc. is the distributor for the Trusts 
(‘‘Distributor’’). The Sponsor, Trustee, 
Depository, and Distributor are not 
affiliated with the Exchange or one 
another, with the exception that the 
Sponsor and Distributor are affiliated. 
Investment Objective of the Trusts 
The investment objective of the Trusts 
is for the Shares to reflect the price of 
the applicable foreign currency owned 
by the specific Trust, plus accrued 
interest, less the expenses and liabilities 
of such Trust. The Shares are intended 
to provide institutional and retail 
investors with a simple, cost-effective 
means of hedging their exposure to a 
particular foreign currency and 
otherwise implement investment 
strategies that involve foreign currency 
(e.g., diversify more generally against 
the risk that the U.S. dollar (‘‘USD’’) 
would depreciate). 
Each of the Trusts’ assets consist, 
primarily, of the applicable foreign 
currency on demand deposit in two 
deposit accounts maintained by the 
Depository: (i) A primary deposit 
account which earns interest, and (ii) a 
secondary deposit account which does 
not earn interest. The secondary deposit 
account is used only in connection with 
mid-month creations and redemptions 
of blocks of 50,000 Shares (‘‘Baskets’’). 
The secondary account is used to 
account for interest that has been earned 
on the primary deposit account during 
the month, but not yet paid, and to 
receive interest earned on the primary 
deposit account, pay Trust expenses, 
and distribute any excess interest to 
shareholders on a monthly basis. 
The Trusts do not hold any derivative 
products. Each Share represents a 
proportional interest in the applicable 
Trust’s portfolio, consisting of a demand 
deposit of foreign currency, as adjusted 
for interest and expenses. The Sponsor 
expects that the price of a Share will 
fluctuate in response to fluctuations in 
the price of the applicable foreign 
currency and that the price of such 
Share will reflect accumulated interest 
as well as the estimated accrued, but 
unpaid, expenses of the Trust. 
Additional information about the 
Trusts and the Currency Trust Shares is 
also available at the Sponsor’s Web site, 
http://www.currencyshares.com. 
Dissemination of Information About the 
Currency Trust Shares 
Quotations for and last-sale 
information regarding the Shares are 
disseminated through the Consolidated 
Tape Association (‘‘CTA’’). The Trustee 
calculates the net asset value (‘‘NAV’’) 
of the respective Trusts, each business 
day. The NAV is expressed in USD and 
is based on the Noon Buying Rate as 
determined by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York (‘‘FRB–NY’’). If the Noon 
Buying Rate has not been determined 
and announced by 2:00 p.m., Eastern 
Time (‘‘ET’’), then the most recent FRB– 
NY determination of the Noon Buying 
Rate is used to determine the NAV of 
the respective Trusts unless the Trustee, 
in consultation with the Sponsor, 
determines that such price is 
inappropriate to use as the basis for 
such valuation. The Trustee also 
determines the NAV per Share, which 
equals the NAV of the respective Trust 
divided by the number of its 
outstanding Shares. The Sponsor 
publishes on its Web site, http:// 
www.currencyshares.com, the NAV and 
NAV per Share for each Trust on each 
day that the NYSE is open for regular 
trading.7 A detailed description of the 
Trusts and the calculation methodology 
for the NAV, as well as a general review 
of the foreign exchange industry, is 
provided in the NYSE Listing Orders.8 
In order to provide updated 
information relating to the Trusts for use 
by investors, professionals, and persons 
wishing to create or redeem Baskets of 
the Shares, the NYSE disseminates, 
through the facilities of CTA, the 
intraday indicative value (‘‘IIV’’) 9 every 
15 seconds during the trading hours for 
the Shares of 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. ET. 
As described in the NYSE Listing 
Orders, distributions are made 
whenever interest deposited in the 
secondary deposit account exceeds the 
sum of the Sponsor’s fee for the prior 
month plus other Trust expenses, if any. 
In such instance, the Trustee would 
direct that the excess be converted into 
USDs at a prevailing market rate and the 
Trustee would distribute that amount as 
promptly as practicable to Shareholders 
on a pro rata basis, in accordance with 
the number of Shares they own. 
Trading Rules 
The Exchange deems Currency Trust 
Shares to be equity securities, thus 
rendering trading in the Shares subject 
to the Exchange’s existing rules 
governing the trading of equity 
securities. The trading hours for the 
Shares on the Exchange will be 9:30 
a.m. to 4:15 p.m. ET. 
Amex Rule 190 generally precludes 
certain business relationships between 
an issuer and the specialist in the 
issuer’s securities. Exceptions in the 
rule permit specialists in the Shares to 
enter into Creation Unit (i.e., Basket) 
transactions to facilitate the 
maintenance of a fair and orderly 
market. Commentary .04 to Amex Rule 
190 specifically applies to Currency 
Trust Shares listed on the Exchange, 
including the Shares. Commentary .04 
states that nothing in Rule 190(a) should 
be construed to restrict a specialist 
registered in a security issued by an 
investment company from purchasing 
and redeeming the listed security, or 
securities that can be subdivided or 
converted into the listed security, from 
the issuer as appropriate to facilitate the 
maintenance of a fair and orderly 
market. 
Stop and Stop Limit Orders 
Amex Rule 154–AEMI, ‘‘Orders in 
AEMI,’’ paragraph (c)(ii), provides that 
stop and stop limit orders to buy or sell 
a security the price of which is 
derivatively priced based upon another 
security or index of securities, may be 
elected by a quotation, as set forth in 
subparagraphs (c)(ii)(1)–(4) of Rule 154– 
AEMI. The Exchange has designated 
Currency Trust Shares, including the 
Shares, as eligible for this treatment.10 
Prospectus Delivery 
Commentary .02 to Amex Rule 
1200B–AEMI, requires that the 
Exchange’s members and member 
organizations provide to all purchasers 
of newly issued Currency Trust Shares 
a prospectus for the series of Currency 
Trust Shares. 
Trading Halts 
Amex will cease trading in the Shares 
if: (i) The primary market stops trading 
the Shares because of a regulatory halt 
akin to a halt based on Amex Rule 117 
and/or a halt because dissemination of 
the IIV has ceased; or (ii) the primary 
market delists the Shares.11

15 In approving this rule change, the Commission 
notes that it has considered the proposal’s impact 
on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 
See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). 
16 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5). 
17 15 U.S.C. 78l(f). 
18 Section 12(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(a), 
generally prohibits a broker-dealer from trading a 
security on a national securities exchange unless 
the security is registered on that exchange pursuant 
to Section 12 of the Act. Section 12(f) of the Act 
excludes from this restriction trading in any 
security to which an exchange ‘‘extends UTP.’’ 
When an exchange extends UTP to a security, it 
allows its members to trade the security as if it were 
listed and registered on the exchange even though 
it is not so listed and registered. 
19 See supra notes 4 and 5. 
Surveillance 
The Exchange represents that its 
surveillance procedures are adequate to 
properly monitor the trading of the 
Shares. Amex will rely on its existing 
surveillance procedures governing 
Currency Trust Shares. 
Information Circular 
In connection with the trading of the 
Shares, Amex will inform its members, 
in an Information Circular, of the 
special characteristics and risks 
associated with trading of the Shares 
such as, a description of the Trusts and 
their respective Shares, how the Shares 
are created and redeemed in Baskets 
(e.g., that Trust Shares are not 
individually redeemable), foreign 
country laws and restrictions, 
applicable Exchange rules, 
dissemination information, trading 
information, and a discussion of any 
relief provided by the Commission or 
the staff from any rules under the Act. 
Additionally, in the Information 
Circular, the Exchange will advise its 
members to deliver a prospectus to 
investors purchasing Shares of the 
Trusts prior to, or concurrently with, the 
confirmation of a transaction in such 
Shares. The Information Circular will 
also remind members of their suitability 
obligations, including Amex Rule 411, 
which imposes a duty of the due 
diligence on its members and member 
firms to learn the essential facts relating 
to every customer prior to the trading of 
the Shares. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange states that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Exchange Act 12 in general 
and furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act 13 in 
particular in that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices; to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade; to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transaction in 
securities; and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that the 
proposal is consistent with Rule 12f–5 
under the Act 14 because the Exchange 
deems the Currency Trust Shares to be 
equity securities, thus rendering the 
Shares subject to the Exchange’s 
existing rules governing the trading of 
equity securities. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received from 
Members, Participants or Others 
The Exchange states that written 
comments were neither solicited nor 
received. 
III. Solicitation of Comments

submit written data, views, and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

IV. Commission Findings and Order 
Granting Accelerated Approval of a 
Proposed Rule Change 
After careful review, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to a national 
securities exchange.15 In particular, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act,16 which requires that 
an exchange have rules designed, among 
other things, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest. The Commission 
believes that this proposal should 
benefit investors by increasing 
competition among markets that trade 
the Shares. 
In addition, the Commission finds 
that the proposal is consistent with 
Section 12(f) of the Act,17 which permits 
an exchange to trade, pursuant to UTP, 
a security that is listed and registered on 
another exchange.18 The Commission 
notes that it previously approved the 
listing and trading of the Shares on 
NYSE and the trading of the Shares on 
NYSE Arca pursuant to UTP.19 The 
Commission also finds that the proposal 
is consistent with Rule 12f–5 under the

Authority, Inc., or FINRA, in connection with the 
consolidation of the member firm regulatory 
functions of NASD and NYSE Regulation, Inc. See

amendments to NASD’s By-Laws to implement 
governance and related changes to accommodate 
the consolidation of the member firm regulatory 
functions of NASD and NYSE Regulation, Inc. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 56145 (July 26, 
2007). The date of closing of the Transaction was 
July 30, 2007. 
Act,20 which provides that an exchange 
shall not extend UTP to a security 
unless the exchange has in effect a rule 
or rules providing for transactions in the 
class or type of security to which the 
exchange extends UTP. The Exchange 
has represented that it meets this 
requirement because it deems the 
Shares to be equity securities, thus 
rendering trading in the Shares subject 
to the Exchange’s existing rules 
governing the trading of equity 
securities. 
The Commission further believes that 
the proposal is consistent with Section 
11A(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act,21 which sets 
forth Congress’ finding that it is in the 
public interest and appropriate for the 
protection of investors and the 
maintenance of fair and orderly markets 
to assure the availability to brokers, 
dealers, and investors of information 
with respect to quotations for and 
transactions in securities. Quotations for 
and last-sale information regarding the 
Shares are disseminated through the 
facilities of the CTA and the 
Consolidated Quotation System. In 
addition, an IIV for each Fund, updated 
to reflect changes in currency exchange 
rates, is calculated by NYSE and 
published via the facilities of the 
Consolidated Tape Association on a 15- 
second delayed basis throughout the 
trading hours for the Shares. Moreover, 
information about the prices of the 
currencies underlying the Funds is 
publicly available from a number of 
sources. 
The Commission also believes that the 
proposal appears reasonably designed to 
preclude trading of the Shares when 
transparency is impaired. Amex has 
represented that it will cease trading in 
the Shares if the listing market stops 
trading the Shares because of a 
regulatory halt similar to a halt based on 
Amex Rule 117 and/or a halt because 
the IIV is not being calculated or 
disseminated. 
In support of this proposal, the 
Exchange has made the following 
additional representations: 
1. The Exchange’s surveillance 
procedures are adequate to properly 
monitor Exchange trading of the Shares 
in all trading sessions and to deter and 
detect violations of Exchange rules. 
2. Prior to the commencement of 
trading, the Exchange would inform its 
members in an Information Bulletin of 
the special characteristics and risks 
associated with trading the Shares. 
3. Prior to the commencement of 
trading, the Exchange would inform its 
members in an Information Bulletin the 
requirement that members deliver a 
prospectus to investors purchasing 
newly issued Shares prior to or 
concurrently with the confirmation of a 
transaction. 
This approval order is based on the 
Exchange’s representations. 
The Commission notes that, if the 
Shares should be delisted by the listing 
exchange, the Exchange would no 
longer have authority to trade the Shares 
pursuant to this order. 
The Commission finds good cause for 
approving this proposal before the 
thirtieth day after the publication of 
notice thereof in the Federal Register. 
As noted previously, the Commission 
previously found that the listing and 
trading of the Shares on NYSE and the 
trading of the Shares on NYSE Arca 
pursuant to UTP are consistent with the 
Act. The Commission presently is not 
aware of any regulatory issue that 
should cause it to revisit those findings 
or would preclude the trading of the 
Shares on the Exchange pursuant to 
UTP. Therefore, accelerating approval of 
this proposal should benefit investors 
by creating, without undue delay, 
additional competition in the market for 
the Shares. 
V. Conclusion 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 22 that the 
proposed rule change (SR–Amex–2007– 
101), be and it hereby is, approved on 
an accelerated basis. 
For the Commission, by the Division of 
Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated 
authority.23

Secretary.
