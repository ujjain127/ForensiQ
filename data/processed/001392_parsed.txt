THE NEW DISTRIBUTED COMPUTERIZED CONTROL of JPL’s 25-FT Space Simulator
A project to refurbish fhe JPL 25-F1” Space Simulator facilities which began in May 1991
will be complete by June 1994. This project included the installation and implementation
of a new distributed computerized control system using GFFanuc 901M-70 Programmable
I,ocal Controller (PLC) hardware and l,ogicMaster~M programming software. Vacuum,
temperature, pressure and solar simulation control elements and instruments arc
connected to modular G}l-Fanuc Geniusl M control blocks. ~’he Genius blocks arc
distributed among ten field-mounted Computer Control Stations (CCS), bussed to the
Central Processing IJnit (CPU) through seven separate Genius Networks (GENHTS).
Redundant CPUS, each connected to all field 1/0, were installed to provide continuous
on-line backup control. A dedicated unint erruplable power sLIpply feeds both CPU racks to
maintain control even during power failure situations. Critical devices were wired in two
separate GItNHls to provide double redundancy, and thus, control surety. This paper will
discuss the design, installation, startup, troubleshooting and current status of this new
control system.
lntmdudim
The initial construction of JI’L’s 25-F’1”  Space Simulator was completed in 1961 and
included a control system which utiliz,ed technology current at that time, That initial
control system was based on remotely-operated, centralized, hardwired controls using
electromechanical relay logic with protective in[erlock circuitry. By the late 1980’s, some
re]dacement parts for this control system were becoming hard to find, especially the
system-specific electromechanical relays. Additionally, PI.C control systems which were
introduced in the early 1970’s, had become very feature-rich and reliable. Accordingly, it
was decided to reconfigure the old control system with a new system based on remotely-
operated, distributed PLC’S using solid state relay logic with protective interlock circuitry.
Afler a review of existing market hardware, GE-17anuc  Genius equipment was selected, its
self-diagnostic capabilities being one of the deciding factors in its selection, The Genius
hardware was configured into seven separate networks, named GFiNETs, and each
network was attached {O two separate CPUS, one serving as the primary or main CIJU and
the other serving as a back-up.
Both CPUS concurrently receive all inputs at all times.
Figure 1 is a schematic which illustrates how the CENE’l”S are configured within the 25-F]’
Space Simulator facility. Figure 2 shows how the G1}NWI’S are attached to the MAIN CPU
RACK and the STANDBY CPU RACK. To insure against control failure of certain critical
process system elements, control circuitry of these critical elements was wired in parallel
to two separate GENETs, which in effect provides double redundant control for these
elements. Thus, these critical elements would still operate if there was a simultaneous
failure of a Genius block, a GENET and a CPU. Figure 3 presents one such configuration
of this ctoub]e redundant control.
Three separate new graphic control panels wem fabricated and installed in the main
control room to provide push-button control of system elements in the vacuum, the
temperature, and the solar simulation control systems.
~“hese panels provide control and
a complete view of the status of all facility system control elements.
The software application Wonderwarc  was selected to develop computer graphic displays
of control element status (open/closed; on/off, etc.), Wonderware provides a full set of
tc~ols for creating graphical representations of the various process elements and for
linking field 1/0 so that process element status can be tracked. The software also provides
the ability to adapt the graphical displays for cm-screen process control such that operators
can control the various process elements either by the computer keyboard or by a mouse
or other point-and-click device,
For the JPI. 2.5 1~1’ Space Simulator, three separate control
windows are planned, one each for vacuum, thermal, and solar simulation system
control, At the time of this writing, these displays have not yet been created.
A typical pumpdown of the 25-ft Space Simulator chamber begins by using a two-stage
axial compressor to evacuate the chamber from atmospheric pressure to 7(I torr in about
10 minutes. For the next 60 minutes, a mechaliical pumping system, consisting of four
Stokes 17221 IC small blower/n~echanical  pump combinations and two large Roots type
blowers (Stokes 171 3), lowers the pressure to the 5 x 10-s torr range. ~’his phase of pumping
is referred to as “roughing” and requires about 70 minutes. During the roughing period, a
liquid nitrogen (1.N2) cooled baffle (cryotrap) prevents mechanical pump oil vapors from
backstreaming into the vacuum chamber. Afler each evacuation, this cryotrap is warmed
to ambient temperature and residual condensate is drained.
When a vacuum of 5 x 10
-3 torr has been attained, the roughing period is complete. At
this point, a contamination plate is flooded with liquid nitrogen to further reduce the
chamber pressure by removing water vapor, and, when the chamber vacuum begins to
asymptote, the new high vacuum (hi-vat) valves, made by Torr-Vat, lnc, are opened.
Ten new Cry-O-Vat 45,000 liter/see cryogenic pumps, which were pre-evacuated and pre-
chilled prior to pumpdown, are available for use in this final stage of evacuation. When
t hc hi-vat valves are opened the chamber pressure reaches 1 x 10-5 torr within 20 minutes.
Each of the new hi-vat valves have a dedicated 100 psig air accumulator which con{ains
enough pressure for three valve strokes - close/open /close. Therefore, even if all control
systems fail, the chamber can still be isolated manually using hi-vat valve accumulators,
After the hi-vat valves have been opened and the chamber pressure begins to asymptote,
the wall and floor shrouds are chilled with cold GN2 then flooded with LN2 to lower the
vacuum pressure to the mid-10-6 t orr range, the minimum chamber pressure obtained
with this system.
‘1’ypically, an additional hour or more is required to reach the lowest
asymptotic vacuum.
1’WO new Balzcr 2200 liter/see turbomo]ecular pumps have been installed to be used
when high loads of helium or hydrogen are encountered. Also, these pumps can be used
for detecting leaks in the chamber and its nitrogen shrouds.
Thermal S@eQeGtticm  Overview
Temperature control of the space simulator chamber shrouds and mirror is achieved
using GN2 and LN2 feed systems, to produce a temperature-controlled stream which is
circulated through the shrouds and mirror to maintain specific test temperature
conditions. For most thermal-vacuum testing, the chamber shrouds are filled (flooded)
with LN2 to minimize chamber temperature and vacuum conditions. Also, LN2 is used
to chill and GN2 is used to warm the cryopump baffles, the contamination plate and the
cryotrap.
solar Sitnulafitm system Qp~ration overview
I’he solar simulation system consists of 37 water-cooled xenon arc lamps each operating
nominally at 30 kW and controlled by one of 37 new electric power supplies, an integrated
lens unit which condenses then projects the ]ight from the lamps, a chamber penetration
window of fused silica which transmits the projected light into the chamber, and a 23-P{.
diameter spherically-radiused  collimator mirror which receives the projected light and
reflects it as a uniform collimated beam onto the test article surface.
QQnmQlsyslem Specifics
The GIi-Fanuc Automation Series 90-70 PLC system provjdes a wide selection of control
90-70 PLC Modules, Genius Blocks and programming software with which to configure a
ccmt rol system.
The JPL 25-f[ Space Simulator installation utiliz,ed 17 different Modules
and 5 different Blocks. Modules were mounted in 90-70 PLC 9-Slot Racks while Blocks
were mounted in CCS I loffman electrical boxes. All field 1/0 was connected to either a
Module or a Block. Table 1 presents identifications of the modules and blocks used in this
project. ~>able 2 shows the I’LC Module configuration in each of the 1790-70 PLC 9-Slot
Racks. Table 3 lists the Genius Blocks and their associated GIiNRT/Block#  designations
for all Blocks that are mounted in the field CC% 1 Ioffman boxes. Figure 3 illustrates how a
typical Genius Block network is connected. In Table 3, the asterisk designates those Blocks
which are redudant  in two separate CENETS.
Figure 4 shows an example of a typical
redundant wiring arrangement for critical valves. l’able 4 gives the I.amp Power Supply
GENE’1’/Block#  designations. Finally, Table 5 presents a cross reference of GENNI”/Block#
identification with respect to field location.
I’rograrnming  of the control system logic was done using l.ogicn~aster~M 90-70
Programming Software.
Keyboard function keys (F!, F2, etc.) are used to se]ect menu
choices which are provided in several embedded layers.
There are nine primary ladder
logic program elemental functions:
relay, tin~er/counter, math, relational, bit operation,
data move, table, conversion and control. There are 28 different relay functions, 19 math
functions, 7 relational functions and 13 bit operations operable on 11 data types. This
thorough toolbox provides options for almost any conceivable control requirement.
Control device status or reference table information is displayed with the prefix 7.1 for
discrete inputs, %Q for discrete outputs, %M foI’ discrete internal coils, %T for discrete
temporary coils, %R for system registers, %AI for analog input, %AQ for analog output,
VOI’ for program registers, %L for local registers and %GA for d i.screte global data. Each 1/0
element is identified with a unique YO label during PLC system configuration. These
labels are used in preparing ladder logic for process control. Table 6 gives a listing of
reference books available from GE-Fanuc Automation. These books describe the details of
all Series 90-70 PLC hardware and software options.

Troubleshooting
The fabrication/installation of the control hardware and the development of the ladder
locic programming took place over the period of 10-11 /92 and throughout 1993. There
were many field wiring corrections to made to make the system function properly, but the
diagnostic characteristics of the GE-Fanuc 1’1 tC system helped to minimize the time
required to locate and correct field wiring anomalies.
Nonetheless, by early 12/93, both
the thermal and vacuum systems were read y to be tested.
System Startup
~“he new control system was first used to operate the thermal and the vacuum system
cc)ntro)s during the period 12/6-7/93. Some problems with mechanical and electrical
hardware were encountered but we experienced no failures of any of the GH-Fanuc
hardware.
Specifically, after being cold during normal vacuum operation, the 10 LN2
valves which are located on the discharge side of the cryopump baffles would not close
when directed to close. Also, the 1.N2 feed valve upstream of the contamination plate
froze opcJI during normal operations and could not be closed without application of heat
directly to the valve body by an operator,
1“’hese 11 valves were all of the same type, . ~
were all new, and will all be replaced with Annin control valves. Another problem
which has recurred with excessive frequency is burnout of the indicator lights which are
associated with the control panel switches.
A considerable supply of small 24 VDC
indicator lights has been procured to cover this burnout problem in the near term. one
suggested long term solution is to replace the 24 VVC incandescent bulbs with 24VDC
LFDs but that solution has not yet been tried.
During the 1-2/93 time period, a complete checkout of all the lamp power supplies was
conducted. Several of the power supplies were inoperative and required field service but
al] 37 circuits are now functioning properly.
All additional solar simulation system
components will be tested in the 5-6/93 time period when a full-up system test will be
conducted. No significant problems are anticipated.
Conclusions
The thermal and vacuum systems have been operated about 20 times since the initial
startup and the thermal and vacuum control system have performed well.
There have
been no other problems with the new distributed control system to date other than those
noted above. The GE- Fanuc 90-70 I’I.C-based control system is very versatile and, so far,
has been reliable in this application.
