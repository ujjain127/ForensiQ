Dear PATHs Participant: 
 
Welcome to the 6th annual Partnerships to Advance THerapeutics (PATHs) meeting. At the first 
annual meeting in 2001, the CERTs responded to the PATHs partners’ request to develop, 
survey, and distribute a registry of projects describing therapeutic initiatives among PATHs 
partners. The first PATHs Registry was distributed in March 2002 at the second annual meeting.  
 
The Registry contains information about research and educational projects from various 
organizations committed to improving the use of therapeutics. It includes summaries of the goals 
and objectives of many of the organizations participating in the program as well as descriptions 
of projects. We trust that the Registry continues to serve as a valuable national resource for 
information about collaborative opportunities which address important therapeutics issues. 
 
The CERTs welcome your organization to submit information to the Registry using the forms 
located on the CERTs Web site: http://www.certs.hhs.gov/partners/paths/regis/index.html. If you 
have questions regarding the PATHs program or the Registry, please feel free to contact Dayna 
Olson-Getty, CERTS Coordinating Center, at dayna.olson@duke.edu. Thank you for your 
commitment to the PATHs program and participation in the PATHs Registry.

radiation.  The FDA is also responsible for 
advancing the public health by helping to 
speed innovations that make medicines and 
foods more effective, safer, and more 
affordable; and helping the public get the 
accurate, science-based information they 
need to use medicines and foods to improve 
their health.
1. Use science-based efficient risk management in all 
Agency regulatory activities, so that the Agency’s limited 
resources can provide the most health promotion and 
protection at the least cost for the public.
2. Enable consumers to make smarter decisions by getting 
them better information to weigh the benefits and risks of 
FDA-regulated products.
3. Seek continuous improvements in patient and consumer 
safety by reducing risks associated with FDA-regulated 
products.
4. Strengthen FDA’s capability to identify, prepare for, and 
respond to terrorist threats and incidents.

health care, food and drug safety, child 
labor and sweatshops, corporate social 
responsibility, personal finance, technology 
and telecommunications, and consumer 
fraud.  NCL provides a wide range of 
consumer information and links to other 
relevant and useful sites through its main 
Web site, www.nclnet.org.
1. Provide useful and reliable information to consumers 
about the safe and appropriate use of medications.
2. Promote communication between consumers and their 
health care providers to improve consumer understanding of

National Council on Patient Information and Education
Mission
Top objectives/goals relative to 
optimizing the use of therapeutics:
Formed in 1982 as one of the original 
patient safety coalitions, NCPIE's mission 
is to improve communication between 
health care professionals and 
patients/consumers about the safe, 
appropriate use of medicines. Its over 120 
coalition members include health 
professional associations, consumer and 
patient advocacy groups, pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, academic institutions, and 
state and federal government agencies (e.g., 
FDA, AHRQ, Administration on Aging). 
NCPIE maintains two websites:  
http://www.talkaboutrx.org and 
http://www.bemedwise.org
1. Pursuant to “Healthy People 2010” (objective #17-4) and 
Public Law 104-180, promote the development and 
awareness of enhanced written consumer medicine 
information (leaflets that accompany prescriptions obtained 
at pharmacies), in accordance with guidelines for 
“usefulness.” 
2. Promote public and professional awareness of the 
importance of oral counseling (at the point of prescribing 
and dispensing) as a supplement to distribution of written 
consumer medicine information (see “Healthy People 2010” 
Objective #17-5).  
3. Six of the top 10 most frequently used medicines are 
available without a prescription.  Promote the safe, 
appropriate use of non-prescription medicines by 
encouraging consumers to: (1) ask questions of health 
professionals prior to using OTC products, and (2) read 
carefully the “Drug Facts” label.

Expert Panel on Acute and Critical Care
The expert panel on Acute and Critical Care consist of nurses who are fellows in the 
American Academy of Nursing who have a focus on issues in acute and critical care 
nursing practice.  The AAN Expert Panels function as a national think tank mechanism 
and are constituted from the top nursing leaders in the country elected by their peers to 
the AAN.  Expert Panels represent the working groups of the Academy performing the 
critical knowledge analysis, summary, and integration for transforming healthcare policy 
and practice.  They provide a flexible and efficient mechanism by which Fellows may 
address emerging issues within the nursing profession and concerns for the health of the 
public, in order to: 
1. Initiate exploration of trends and issues important to health care delivery and policy; 
2. Recommend actions to the Board of Directors and the Fellowship; 
3. Provide expert opinion on issues critical to the provision of health care and the well-
being of the American people; and 
4. Prepare documents that reflect the synthesis of philosophic and scientific knowledge 
aligned with the strategic directions of the Academy.
The Expert Panel on Acute and Critical Care has completed several projects, including:
1. With funding from Nurse Competence in Aging (NCA) Specialty Nursing Association 
Partner in Geriatrics (SNAPG), completed a consensus document addressing strategies 
to reduce deterioration in hospitalized elders. 
2. Based on work on the consensus document, submitted eight manuscripts for 
publication in the journal Critical Care Nursing Clinics.
3. Coordinated a symposium at the 2006 State of the Science in Nursing Research 
Congress addressing the theme "Methodological and Design Challenges in Acute Care 
Research. 
4. A subgroup of panel members contributed two chapters to a forthcoming book, 
"Advances in Patient Safety and Quality - An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses," 
being published by AHRQ.

Medication Use Campaign
AARP is using 2005 to plan and develop a medication use campaign that will launch in 
2006.  The campaign may include consumer  information on: making informed decisions 
about medication options; avoiding medication errors, adverse drug reactions and drug-
drug interactions; underuse and overuse of medications; use of inappropriate medication; 
comparative effectiveness; enhancing medication compliance; enhancing 
doctor/pharmacist and patient communications; and personal medication records. Many 
of these issues have been addressed in an on-line medication use learning course that 
will appear on AARP’s website in Spring 2005.
Planned and will start within year
AARP will enter into partnerships with organizations that share an interest in appropriate 
medication use.
Parters may include: national physician organizations, AARP Health 
Guide partners, allied health professional groups, health care purchasers 
and companies; pharmacist associations, and chain drugstores. We also 
seek to join other relavent coalitions.

Evidence-Based Research
In February 2005, AARP unveiled its drug safety and effectiveness program at 
http://www.aarp.org/researchRx.  This program incorporates evidence-based research of 
the Drug Evidence-based Practice Center.  Components of AARP's program include 
simplified comparative information about prescription drug safety and costs, accessible 
by health condition and/or by specific drug.  The online information includes all 
therapeutic classes reviewed by OHSU to date; this will be updated and new classes 
added as OHSU completes their work.
Currently ongoing
Current partners are AARP's state chapters.
Additional partners are sought to help fund research about consumer and 
health provider opinions about evidence-based research, and to help 
develop educational products for both audiences.

ASHP Therapeutic Position Statement on Strategies for Preventing and Treating Osteoporosis
This document supports the use of appropriate pharmacotherapy for the prevention and 
treatment of osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis is a serious health disorder characterized by low 
bone mineral density and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone 
fragility.  The document will focus on medications that have been shown to increase 
bone mineral density ands prevent fractures.  Appropriate drug selection depends on 
several patient specific factors.  Many patients at risk for osteoporosis or who have 
sustained an osteoporotic fracture remain undiagnosed or untreated.

Arthritis Foundation Quality Indicator Set (AFQuIP) project
This project was designed to develop, validate and foster implementation of a core set of 
indicators to be used as the basis for arthritis care quality measurement and performance 
improvement. Indicators were developed for Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and 
analgesic utilization.  Since the completion of the AFQuIP set in 2002, a number of 
organizations have utilized the indicators  to assist in efforts to improve arthritis care.  
The Arthritis Foundation partnered with the National Committee for Quality Assurance 
to specify and field-test potential performance measures for inclusion in the Health Plan 
Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS).  As a result of this collaboration, a 
measure focused on the use of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) in 
people with Rheumatoid Arthritis will be added to HEDIS in 2006.  In addition, in 
projects focused on osteoarthritis and pain management, the AFQuIP indicators have 
been used by the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement, the American 
Medical Association (AMA), and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations (JCAHO).  Osteoarthritis measures based on AFQuIP indicators are also 
part of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Doctor's Office Quality 
project.  The Arthritis Foundation would like to continue to disseminate the AFQuIP set 
and will submit the indicators to the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse in 2005.

Principles for Protecting Integrity into Conduct and Reporting of Clinical Trials
Public concern is high regarding the timely and complete reporting of clinical trial 
results, primarily when the trials are sponsored by the drug, biologicals, or device 
industries. Because academic researchers and their institutions often play a prominent 
role in such trials, these concerns challenge the integrity of the academic medical 
research community as well as the sponsors of the trials. The AAMC held a small 
invitational conference June 22-23, 2005, to address these concerns. The conference 
produced a set of principles and standards that should guide institutions and their 
investigators in the analysis and reporting of clinical trials in which they participate.

recommendations after a heart attack. The program originally focused on adherence to 
beta-blockers after heart attack, and expanded to broader treatment recommendations in 
late-2004, including other post-MI medications and lifestyle recommendations. Tools for 
consumer and professional audiences have been designed and distributed through 
CAQH member health plans.  Quantitative and qualitative research has been conducted 
to assess attitudes, beliefs and behaviors regarding adherence to treatment 
recommendations.  Using administrative health plan data, measures have been designed 
that will assess long-term patient adherence to beta-blockers, ACE-
Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and lipid-lowering medications at various 
intervals after a heart attack in order to assess the impact of the initiative.

Pain Management Series
NPC partnered with JCAHO on a two-phase project with the goal of contributing to the 
quality and safety of pain assessment, management and treatment for patients and 
consumers.  The project’s objectives are to (1) help establish the under-treatment of 
pain; (2) enhance dissemination of JCAHO’s new pain management measurements and 
standards; (3) provide resources for organizations to implement and measure the use of 
evidence-based standards; and (4) to facilitate quality improvement efforts.  Two 
monographs, “Pain: Current Understanding of Assessment, Management, and 
Treatments,” and “Improving the Quality of Pain Management Through Measurement 
and Action,” have been completed.  Both monographs focus on non-malignant pain and 
were completed with the oversight of separate expert advisory panels. CE programs have 
been developed for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and physician 
assistants based on the first monograph. An addendum to the first monograph updating 
the therapeutic agents available for pain management is in progress. CE programs have 
been developed for pharmacists and physician assistants based on the first monograph, 
and additional programs are in development for physicians, nurses, and nurse 
practitioners.

National Voluntary Consensus Standards for the Reporting of Therapeutic Drug Management 
Quality
This project seeks to achieve consensus on a comprehensive framework for therapeutic 
drug management quality, and to identify and endorse developed and implemented 
performance standards that address the domains of the framework (decisionmaking, 
safety, education and adherence, efficiency, and implementation). This project also will 
make recommendations regarding priority areas for research and standards development 
where there are gaps. This project builds on other related NQF work, specifically in the 
areas of safe practices, ambulatory care medication management, adherence and safety 
in medication use, and other NQF-endorsed voluntary consensus standards related to the 
appropriate use of therapeutics in various healthcare settings and circumstances.
Currently ongoing
All NQF member organizations (including consumer, purchaser, provider/health plan, and 
research/quality improvement organizations) are current partners.
Additional partners are welcome to participate in dissemination of the 
core set of practices and products/formats to stimulate implementation.
