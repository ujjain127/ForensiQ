Approximately 203,300 prisoners
serving a sentence in a State or
Federal prison in 1997 were armed
when they committed the crime for
which they were serving time.  An
estimated 18% of State prison inmates
and 15% of Federal inmates reported
using, carrying, or possessing a firearm
during the crime for which they were
sentenced.  In 1991, 16% of State
inmates and 12% of Federal inmates
said they were armed at the time of
their offense.
Among all inmates in 1997, 9% of
those in State prisons and 2% of those
in Federal prisons said they fired a gun
while committing their current offense.
Of violent offenders, 18% of State
inmates and 9% of Federal inmates  
discharged a firearm.  Less than 2% 
of inmates serving time for a drug,
property, or public-order offense fired a
gun during the crime that resulted in
their prison sentence. 
Among prisoners who carried a firearm
during the offense for which they were
serving time in 1997, 14% had bought
or traded for the gun from a store,
pawnshop, flea market, or gun show.
The 1997 percentage who had
acquired their firearm at a retail outlet
represented a significant drop from
21% in 1991.  The percentage of
inmates receiving their gun from family
or friends rose from 34% in 1991 to
40% in 1997.
• During the offense that brought them
to prison, 15% of State inmates and
13% of Federal inmates carried a
handgun; about 2% had a military-style
semiautomatic gun or machine gun.
• Among inmates in prison for
homicide, a sexual assault, robbery,
assault or other violent crime, 30% of
State offenders and 35% of Federal
offenders carried a firearm when
committing the crime.  Almost a fourth
of State inmates and almost a third of
Federal inmates serving a sentence
for a violent crime had carried a
handgun during the offense.
• 29% of State inmates under age 25
at the time of the survey were carrying
a gun when they committed their
current offense compared to 15% of
those 35 or older. 
• In 1997 among State inmates  
possessing a gun, fewer than 2%  
bought their firearm at a flea market 
or gun show, about 12% from a retail
store or pawnshop, and 80% from
family, friends, a street buy, or an
illegal source.
• On average, State inmates possess-
ing a firearm received sentences of 18
years, while those without a weapon
had an average sentence of 12 years.
• Among prisoners carrying a firearm
during their crime, 40% of State
inmates and 56% of Federal inmates
received a sentence enhancement
because of the firearm.

Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities 
Firearm Use by Offenders
Data for this report are based primarily
on personal interviews with large
nationally representative samples of
State and Federal prison inmates.  In
the 1997 and 1991 Surveys of Inmates
in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, inmates were questioned
about any firearms they may have used
when committing a crime and asked to
specify the type of weapon, its source,
and its use in committing crimes.  In
addition, inmates were queried about
the types of both current and past of-
fenses for which they were sentenced,
including any weapons offenses.
Almost a fifth of prison inmates 
carried a gun during their crime
An estimated 18% of State prison
inmates and 15% of Federal inmates
reported that they used, carried, or
possessed a firearm when they
committed the crime for which they
were serving a sentence to prison
(table 1).1  
When asked if they had ever been
armed while committing a crime, about
a quarter of State prison inmates and a
fifth of Federal inmates reported that
they had carried a gun while commit-
ting at least one crime.  
Almost half of both State and Federal
inmates said that they had owned or
possessed a firearm at some time in
their lives.  Equivalent measures for
lifetime gun ownership among adults in
the general population are difficult to
find.  Personal or telephone interviews
and polls provide estimates for persons
in the general population owning a
firearm at the time of the survey.  An
estimated 25% to 29% of the adult
population reported currently owning a
firearm when surveyed.2   According to
public opinion polls, members of 4 in
every 10 U.S. households have access
to a gun. 
Less than 2% of inmates reported
carrying a fully automatic or
military-style semiautomatic firearm 
 
Fewer than 1 in 50 State and Federal
inmates used, carried, or possessed a
military-style semiautomatic gun or a
fully automatic gun during their current
offense (table 2).  These guns, as used
in the questions and definitions for the
personal interviews with prison
inmates, include the following:
• military-style semiautomatic pistol —
similar to a conventional semiauto-
matic pistol except that the magazine
or clip is visible3
• military-style semiautomatic rifle — 
a semiautomatic rifle with military fea-
tures such as a pistol grip, folding
stock, flash suppressor, or bayonet
mount
• military-style semiautomatic shotgun
— a semiautomatic shotgun with
military features such as a pistol grip,
folding stock, flash suppressor, or
bayonet mount
• machine gun — a fully automatic gun
which, if the trigger is held down, will
fire rapidly and continuously.
Some examples of these firearms are
the UZI, TEC-9, and MAC10 for hand-
guns; the AR-15 and AK-47 for rifles;
and the "Street Sweeper" for shotguns.
Possession of these models meeting
criteria specified in Federal statutes
can be unlawful.
To be understood by inmate respon-
dents who were asked about their gun
use, the questions and definitions in
the survey reflect terminology com-
monly used by prisoners to describe
types of  weapons.  If questioned by
respondents, interviewers read to them
the definitions included on pages 14
and 15 of this report.  Of necessity, this
language is similar in concept but may
differ in wording from technical descrip-
tions in Federal statutes pertaining to
firearms.
The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994 made it
unlawful, with certain exceptions, to
manufacture, transfer, or possess
military-style semiautomatic weapons,

Of inmates who carried a firearm
during their offense, 8 in 10 had a
handgun
Inmates reported that a handgun was
their preferred firearm; of those carry-
ing a firearm, 83% of State inmates
and 87% of Federal inmates said that
they carried a handgun during the
offense for which they were serving
their longest sentence.  About 8% of
State inmates who had carried a
firearm during the commission of their
crime reported having a military-style
semiautomatic (7%) or fully automatic
(2%) firearm, with some carrying both.
Firearm use during crimes
increased from 1991 to 1997
Over the 6 years between surveys of
inmates, 1991-97, possession of a
firearm during a crime increased from
16% to 18% of State inmates and from
12% to 15% of Federal inmates (table
3).  Because of the growth in the prison
population, the estimated number of
inmates carrying a firearm increased
dramatically — from 114,100 in 1991 
to 190,400 in 1997 in State prisons 
and from 6,300 in 1991 to 12,900 
in 1997 in Federal prisons.  These
estimates were based on inmates who
reported carrying a firearm during the
offense for which they received their
longest sentence. 
8% of drug offenders and 3% 
of property offenders armed while
committing their crimes
Fewer than 1 in 10 offenders serving a
sentence for selling or carrying illegal
drugs and 1 in 30 inmates in prison for
a property crime — burglary, larceny,
fraud, or destruction of property — had
a firearm with them while committing
their current offense (table 4).
Inmates who had been sentenced 
for violent crimes used firearms more
often than other prisoners.  They were
more likely than property, drug, or
public-order offenders to have used 
or possessed a gun during their crime.
An estimated 30% of violent offenders
in State prisons and 35% in Federal
prisons had a firearm at the time of the
offense. 
Offenders sentenced for homicide or
for robbery reported the most extensive
use of firearms. Among inmates
sentenced for homicide, about 43% 
in State prisons and 39% in Federal
prisons said they were carrying a
firearm when they committed the
offense.  About 35% serving time 
for robbery in State prisons and 40% 
in Federal prison had a gun.

4   Firearm Use by Offenders 
Male inmates and young inmates carried firearms
Male State and Federal offenders were more likely than their
female counterparts to have carried a firearm when committing
their offense.  About 19% of men in State prison and 16% in
Federal prison reported using or possessing a firearm when
committing their most serious offense, compared to 7% of
women in State prison and 6% in Federal prison (table 5).
An estimated 21% of black non-Hispanic inmates in State
prison, 18% of Hispanics, and 15% of white non-Hispanics said
they had a gun with them while committing their most serious
offense.  About 18% of black and white inmates in Federal
facilities and 8% of Hispanics had carried a firearm.
Young State inmates were more likely than older inmates to use
firearms.  About 29% of inmates under the age of 25 at the time
of the survey were carrying a gun when they committed their
current offense, compared to 15% of those 35 or older.  Among
Federal inmates, about 19% under age 25 and 14% age 35 or
older said they had a gun with them.
Weapon offenses include unlawful distribution, sale,
manufacture, alteration, transport, possession, or 
use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or accessory.
In 1998 an estimated 195,000 persons were arrested
by State or local law enforcement or referred to a U.S.
attorney for prosecution for a weapon offense —
counting only the most important offense and no
secondary offenses.  Over 35,000 persons were
convicted of a weapon offense.  About 49,000 per-
sons were in a local jail or State or Federal prison for
a weapon offense in 1998.  An additional 100,000
were serving a sentence in the community on proba-
tion, parole, or supervised release.  
An estimated 12% of State prison inmates and 19%
of Federal inmates were either currently serving a
sentence for a weapon offense or had been
sentenced for a weapon offense in the past.

Table 5.  Possession of a firearm during current offense, 
by selected characteristics for State and Federal prison
inmates, 1997 
Background characteristics account
for relatively small differences 
in firearm use
When inmates were interviewed for the
1997 Surveys, they were asked about
their family background and experi-
ences they had when growing up.
Characteristics about which the
inmates reported include parental
upbringing, parental incarceration,
welfare assistance to their family,
parental use of alcohol and drugs, and
peer participation in criminal behavior.
Inmates who grew up living with both
parents were less likely to be using or
carrying a firearm than those who grew
up primarily living with one parent,
grandparents, other relatives, friends,
or a foster family.  An estimated 16%
of State inmates and 13% of Federal
inmates living with both parents had a
gun with them, compared to 20% of
State inmates and 17% of Federal
inmates living in some other arrange-
ment while growing up (table 6).
A higher percentage of State inmates
with a parent who had served a
sentence to incarceration carried a gun
(23%) than those whose parents had
never been in prison or jail (17%).  For
Federal inmates, 18% of inmates who
had incarcerated parents and 15% of
those who did not carried a firearm.
Inmates who lived in families receiving
welfare or living in publicly-subsidized  
housing while growing up were more
likely than those who did not live under
these types of government programs 
to be carrying a weapon.  About 1 in 5
inmates whose family received welfare
or who lived in publicly financed
housing carried a firearm.  About 
1 in 6 State inmates and 1 in 7 Federal
inmates whose parents were not
receiving welfare benefits or living in
publicly-financed housing had a gun.  
A quarter of State inmates who said
they had a parent who had abused
drugs reported that they were carrying
a gun while committing their current
offense.  In contrast, less than a fifth of
those whose parents did not abuse
substances had a firearm.
About 20% of State and Federal
inmates whose friends while growing
up used or traded drugs, stole,
destroyed or damaged property, broke
or entered private property, or robbed
someone reported that they had a
firearm with them when they committed
their controlling offense.  An estimated
15% of State inmates and 9% of
Federal inmates who did not have
friends involved in illegal activities
   Firearm Use by Offenders    5
As one measure of violence in
inmates' lives, inmates were asked if
they had ever been shot at.  This
experience could have been at any
time in their lives, including when they
were committing the crime for which
they were in prison.  About half of
State prisoners reported that in the
past they had been shot at by
someone, and more than a fifth had
actually been wounded by gunfire.  A
quarter of State and Federal inmates
who had been shot at were carrying 
a firearm during their current offense,
compared to a tenth of those who 
had never been shot at.

Table 6.  State and Federal prison inmates possessing a firearm during their
most serious offense, by characteristics of their family and background, 1997 
used or possessed a firearm during
their current offense.  
Violent recidivists were as likely as
first time violent offenders to have
carried a gun 
Recidivism does not appear to be
related to whether inmates were carry-
ing guns when the type of current
offense is taken into account.  Violent
offenders who had served a prior
sentence and first time violent offend-
ers were about equally likely to be
carrying a firearm when committing
their current offense — about 30% of
violent offenders in State prisons
carried a firearm (table 7).  About a
third of violent Federal offenders,
whether recidivist or first time, carried a
firearm. 
Less than 10% of both first time and
repeat State offenders serving time for
property, drug, and public-order
offenses carried a gun.  Drug offenders
who were recidivists were more likely
to be carrying a firearm than first-time
drug offenders (9% versus 6% of State
inmates and 11% versus 5% of
Federal inmates). 
Inmates who had served prior
sentences as a juvenile were more
likely to have had a gun than those
who did not have a juvenile record.  
For State offenders 22% who had a
juvenile record and 13% with only an
adult record had a firearm while
committing their current offense; for
Federal offenders 27% with a juvenile
record and 14% with only an adult
record possessed a firearm.
Inmates' retail purchase of firearms
fell between 1991 and 1997
In 1997, 14% of State inmates who had
used or possessed a firearm during
their current offense bought or traded
for it from a retail store, pawnshop, flea
market, or gun show (table 8).  Nearly
40% of State inmates carrying a
firearm obtained the weapon from
family or friends.  About 3 in 10
received the weapon from drug
dealers, off the street, or through the
black market.  Another 1 in 10 obtained
their gun during a robbery, burglary, or
other type of theft.   
From 1991 to 1997 the percent of State
inmates with guns who acquired them
at a retail outlet fell from 21% to 14%.
At the same time the percentage
reporting that they used firearms
furnished by family or friends increased
from 34% to 40%. Between the two
surveys the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act of 1993 was enacted.
The act requires background checks
for persons purchasing firearms from
federally licensed firearm dealers.
Changes in how inmates obtained
firearms, when the two surveys are
compared, may or may not reflect the
requirements in the Brady Act.
Inmates may have procured their
firearm or entered prison before the
Brady Act became effective in 1994.

   Firearm Use by Offenders    7
About 30% of State inmates and 35% of
Federal inmates sentenced for a violent
offense — homicide, sexual assault,
robbery, or assault — used or possessed
a firearm when committing their current
offense.   A quarter of violent State
prisoners and almost a third of Federal
prisoners carried a handgun.  Fewer than
1 in 10, however, carried a long gun — a
rifle or shotgun — or a military-style
semiautomatic or fully automatic weapon. 
Inmates serving time for violent crimes
were more likely to use a firearm when
their victims were male rather than
female, 18 or older rather than under age
18, and strangers, known by sight, or  
known casually rather than persons the
inmates knew well.
• About 40% of violent State offenders
who victimized a male had a gun
compared to 17% of offenders when 
the victim was female.
• 39% of violent State inmates with a
black victim and 33% of those with a
Hispanic victim used a firearm, signifi-
cantly more than the 25% with a white
victim.         
• Less than 10% of those who victimized
persons 17 or younger, compared to over
33% of those who victimized persons 18
or older, possessed a firearm.  
• Over a third of violent offenders used
guns when their victims were strangers
and casual acquaintances, compared to a
fifth who used guns against persons they
knew.  
• 27% of offenders who victimized a
current or former spouse, boyfriend, or
girlfriend were armed while committing
the crime.  About 8% used guns against
other relatives, including children,
siblings, and other family members.

1997
Recidivists less likely than first
timers to buy their gun from a retail
establishment
Although existence of a prior record 
did not change inmates' likelihood of
having carried a gun while committing
their current crime, it did influence
where they acquired their gun.  Recidi-
vists were less likely than those who
were first time offenders to have
purchased their gun from a retail store,
pawnshop, flea market, or gun show.
About a tenth of recidivists and a fifth
of first timers purchased their gun 
from a retail establishment (table 9).  
A larger percentage of recidivists than
first time offenders obtained their
weapon through illegal activities or
from the street or a black market
source — 42% of recidivists and 31%
of first timers. 
Recidivists with firearms were as likely
as first time offenders to obtain their
gun from a family member or friends in
1997— about 40% acquired their guns
from either family or friends.
The percentage of inmates who
purchased or traded from a retail
outlet, such as a store or pawnshop,
fell during this period for both those
with prior sentences and those without
them.  For repeat offenders, purchas-
ing from retail fell from 17% to 11%,
and for first time offenders from 33% 
to 20%. 
For recidivists the percentage of
inmates with firearms who obtained
them from family or friends rose from
1991 to 1997 — for recidivists from
33% in 1991 to 39% in 1997 and for
first timers from 36% in 1991 to 41% 
in 1997.

1 in 5  military-style semiautomatic
or fully automatic guns bought from
retail store
About a fifth of inmates with a military-
style semiautomatic or fully automatic
weapon bought it retail — at a store,
flea market, or gun show (table 10).
About a sixth of inmates with a conven-
tional semiautomatic weapon and an
eighth with a single-shot gun also had
made a retail purchase. 
While family and friends provided a
quarter of military-style semiautomatic
or fully automatic firearms, they gave
inmates over a third of the conventional
semiautomatic weapons and just under
half of the single-shot guns.  
Almost half of inmates possessing  
military-style semiautomatic or fully
automatic weapons, about two-fifths of
those with conventional semiautomatic
firearms, and over a third of offenders
having single-shot guns had got their
firearm in a theft or burglary, or from a
drug dealer, fence, or black market.
Young offenders less likely than
older ones to have bought a firearm
from a retail source
 
Young offenders were less likely than
older inmates to have bought their gun
from a retail outlet (table 11).  About
7% of inmates 24 or younger and 22%
of those 35 or older obtained their gun
from a retail outlet.
About half of inmates who were 24 or
younger, compared to less than a third
of those 35 or older, acquired their gun
through illegal activities, a drug dealer,
or a black market.
Among those possessing a firearm
during their current offense, an
estimated 17% of women and 14% of
men purchased their guns from a retail
establishment.  About 3 in 10 women
offenders and 4 in 10 male inmates
acquired their firearms from a theft,
burglary, drug dealer, fence, or black
market.  Family and friends provided
guns to about 46% of female inmates
with firearms and 39% of male
inmates.

Federal law may have disqualified
over 8 in 10 inmates from buying a
firearm 
The Gun Control Act of 1968, as
amended, and other Federal statutes
list conditions which disqualify an
individual from possessing a firearm or
purchasing it from a licensed dealer.
Some of these conditions include a
prior felony conviction or indictment,
current illegal drug use or addiction,
dishonorable discharge from the
Armed Forces, or being a fugitive from
justice, a mental incompetent, or a
nonresident alien.  The Brady Act,
effective in 1994, mandated that feder-
ally licensed firearm dealers obtain  
background checks of potential
purchasers, based on the conditions 
of eligibility.
A slightly lower percentage of State
prisoners who had a gun, compared to
those who did not, reported having a
characteristic which may have disquali-
fied them, as defined by Federal law.
About 84% of State inmates who had
possessed a gun and 88% who did not
have a gun may have met at least one
of the conditions, as measured in the
inmate survey (table 12).  
Among State inmates, those with and
without guns answered differently on
only two conditions.  About 50% of
those with a firearm and 56% without
had a prior sentence to incarceration;
about 37% with a gun and 49% without
were on probation or parole. On other  
factors, about the same percentages
reported meeting a condition that could
have made them ineligible to purchase
a firearm.  Almost 6 in 10 said they had
used illegal drugs before their control-
ling offense, about 1 in 10 had stayed
in a mental health facility overnight,
and 1 in 20 was a noncitizen. 
Higher percentages of Federal inmates
with guns than without them reported
meeting at least one of the conditions
of the Federal laws.  About 83% with a
firearm and 78% without one may have
been disqualified from purchasing a
gun.  Higher percentages of inmates
using guns compared to those without
a gun had a prior incarceration (55%
versus 37%), were on probation or
parole when arrested (32% versus.
26%), or had used illegal drugs shortly
before committing their current offense
(56% versus 43%).   
9% of all State prison inmates and
2% of all Federal inmates shot a gun
while committing their current
offense
In total, about 1 in 10 State inmates
and 1 in 50 Federal inmates fired their
gun while committing their current
offense (table 13).  Among inmates
serving a sentence for a single violent
crime incident, 18% of State inmates
and 9% of Federal inmates said they
fired the gun they were carrying.

Table 13.  Extent of weapon use during current offense, 
for State and Federal prison inmates, 1997
About 1% of inmates serving a
sentence for a single property, drug, or
public-order incident discharged a gun.
 
Fewer than 1 in 20 State inmates and 
1 in 10 Federal inmates, regardless of
type of offense, said they possessed a
firearm but did not use it.  Another 2%
reported they had another weapon,
including a knife, scissors, ax, rock,
club or other sharp or blunt object.
About half of inmates carrying a gun
during their offense fired it and half
of those injured or killed someone 
If inmates carried a firearm, they
tended to use it.  Among inmates
possessing a firearm and committing
only one incident, four-fifths of State
inmates and half of Federal inmates
either fired the weapon or brandished
or displayed it while committing the
crime (table 14). 
An estimated 23% of State inmates
and 5% of Federal inmates with a gun
either killed or injured their victim.
Another 26% of State inmates and 
8% of Federal inmates with a gun
discharged the gun but did not injure 
or kill anyone with it.   
Besides firing their weapon, inmates
used their guns for other purposes.
About half of State inmates said they
used it to scare someone, about
two-fifths to defend themselves, 
and a fifth to "get away."
About 81% of State inmates with a
single-shot gun,  79% with a conven-
tional semiautomatic, and 75% with a
military-style semiautomatic weapon or
a fully automatic  weapon either fired or
brandished it (table 15).  About 51%
with a single-shot gun, 46% with a
conventional semiautomatic firearm,
and 43% with a military-style semiauto-
matic weapon or a fully automatic  
weapon discharged their firearm.
About a fifth either injured or killed their
victim, regardless of the type of
firearm.  
About a quarter of inmates carrying
military-style semiautomatic weapon or
a fully automatic  weapon and a fifth of
those with a conventional semiauto-
matic or single-shot weapon did not
actively use the gun in any way,
discharging it or displaying it to scare
someone, defend oneself, or "get
away."

Table 15.  Extent of firearm use during current offense, 
for State prison inmates possessing a firearm, 1997 
Possession of a firearm during an
offense increased sentences and
expected time served of inmates
On average, inmates possessing a
firearm had longer sentences and
expected to serve a longer time than
those who had not used or possessed
a firearm while committing their
offense.  Sentences for State inmates
with firearms had an average of about
18 years, while those for inmates
without a firearm were about 12 years
(table 16).  Those who had carried a
firearm expected to serve about 10
years on their sentence, and those
without a firearm, 7 years.
Violent offenders with firearms had on
average a sentence of over 20 years  
and those without firearms, about 18
years.  Violent offenders who had
carried a gun also expected to serve
12 years on average and those who did
not carry them, 10 years.  
Significantly higher percentages of
inmates who possessed firearms,
compared to those who did not,
received a sentence enhancement,
generally for possessing a firearm.
About 40% of State inmates who
carried a firearm during their current
offense and 6% who were not carrying
a firearm were given an enhancement
to their sentence because of a firearm
offense (table 17).  About 56% of
Federal inmates who carried a firearm
and 14% who did not carry one
received a weapons offense
enhancement.
Methodology 
The U.S. Census Bureau conducted
the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities (SISCF) for the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and
the 1997 Survey of Inmates in Federal
Correctional Facilities (SIFCF) for BJS
and the Bureau of Prisons.  From June
through October, 1997, inmates were
interviewed about their current offense
and sentences, criminal histories,
family and personal backgrounds, gun
possession and use, prior drug and
alcohol use and treatment, educational
programs, and other services provided
while in prison.  Similar surveys of
State prison inmates were conducted
in 1974, 1979, 1986, and 1991.
Federal inmates were surveyed for the
first time in 1991.
Sample design
The samples for the SISCF and SIFCF
were taken from a universe of 1,409
State prisons and 127 Federal prisons
enumerated in the 1995 Census of
State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities or opened between comple-
tion of the census and June 30, 1996.
The sample design for both surveys
was a stratified two-stage selection;
first, selecting prisons, and second,
selecting inmates in those prisons.
In the first stage correctional facilities
were separated into two sampling
frames:  one for prisons with male
inmates and one for prisons with
female inmates.  Prisons holding both
genders were included on both lists.

In the sampling of State facilities, the
13 largest male prisons and 17 largest
female prisons were selected with
certainty.  The remaining 1,265 male
facilities and 261 female facilities were
stratified into 14 strata defined by
census region (Northeast except New
York, New York, Midwest, South
except Texas, Texas, West except
California, and California).  Within each
stratum facilities were ordered by facil-
ity type (confinement and community-
based), security level (maximum,
medium, minimum, and none), and
size of population.  A systematic
sample of prisons was then selected
within strata with probabilities propor-
tionate to the size of each prison.
For the sample of Federal prisons, one
male prison and two female prisons
were selected with certainty.  The
remaining 112 male facilities were
classified into 5 strata defined by
security level (administrative, high,
medium, low, and minimum).  The 20
remaining female facilities were strati-
fied into 2 strata by security level
(minimum and not minimum).  Within
security level, facilities were ordered by
size of population and then selected
with probability proportionate to size.
For the State survey 280 prisons were
selected, 220 male facilities and 60
female facilities.  Of the 280 facilities 3
refused to allow interviewing and 2
closed before the survey could be
conducted.  Overall, 32 male facilities
and 8 female facilities were selected
for the Federal survey, and all
participated.
In the second stage, inmates were
selected for interviewing.  For State
facilities interviewers selected the
sample systematically using a random
start and a total number of interviews
based on the gender of the inmates
and the size of the facility.  For Federal
facilities, a sample of inmates was
selected for each facility from the
Bureau of Prisons central list, using a
random start and predetermined
sampling interval.  
All selected drug offenders were then
subsampled so that only a third were
eligible for interview.  As a result,
approximately 1 in every 75 men and 1
in 17 women were selected for the
State survey, and 1 in every 13 men
and 1 in every 3 women were selected
for the Federal survey.  
A total of 14,285 interviews were
completed for the State survey and
4,041 for the Federal survey, for overall
response rates of 92.5% in the State
survey and 90.2% in the Federal
survey.
The interviews, about an hour in length,
used computer-assisted personal inter-
viewing (CAPI).  With CAPI, computers
provide questions for the interviewer,
including follow-up questions tailored to
preceding answers.  Before the inter-
view, inmates were told verbally and in
writing that participation was voluntary
and that all information provided would
be held in confidence.  Participants
were assured that the survey was
solely for statistical purposes and that
no individual who participated could be
identified through use of survey results.
Estimates of prisoner counts
Based on the completed interviews,
estimates for the entire population
were developed using weighting factors
derived from the original probability of
selection in the sample.  These factors
were adjusted for variable rates of
nonresponse across strata and
inmates’ characteristics and offenses.
The sample for the State survey was
adjusted to midyear custody counts for
June 30, 1997, from data obtained in
the National Prisoner Statistics series
(NPS-1A).  The sample from the
Federal facilities was weighted to the
total known sentenced custody popula-
tion at midyear 1997.
Excluded from the estimate of Federal
inmates were unsentenced inmates
and those prisoners under Federal
jurisdiction but housed in State and
private contract facilities.  Those
prisoners who were under State juris-
diction, yet held in local jails or private-
facilities, were excluded from the
estimated number of State prisoners.
As a result, the estimated prisoner
counts do not match those in other BJS
data series.  The estimated prisoner
counts vary according to the particular
data items analyzed.  Estimates are
based on the number of prisoners who
provided information on selected items.
Accuracy of the estimates
The accuracy of the estimates
presented in this report depends on 
two types of error:  sampling and
nonsampling.  Sampling error is the
variation that may occur by chance
because a sample rather than a
complete enumeration of the popula-
tion was conducted.  Nonsampling
error can be attributed to many
sources, such as nonresponses, differ-
ences in the interpretation of questions
among inmates, recall difficulties, and
processing errors.  In any survey the
full extent of the nonsampling error is
never known.  The sampling error, as
measured by an estimated standard
error, varies by the size of the estimate
and the size of the base population.
Revised 2/04/02, th
   Firearm Use by Offenders    13
Estimates of the standard errors have
been calculated for the 1997 surveys.
(See appendix tables 1 and 2.)  For
example, the 95-percent confidence
interval around the percentage of State
inmates who carried a firearm during
current offense is approximately 18.4%
plus or minus 1.96 times 0.42% (or
17.6% to 19.2%). 
These standard errors may also be
used to test the significance of the
difference between two sample statis-
tics by pooling the standard errors of
the two sample estimates.  For
example, the standard error of the
difference between violent or drug
offenders carrying firearms when
committing their current offense would
be 1.0% (or the square root of the sum
of the squared standard errors for each
group).  The 95%-confidence interval
around the difference would be 1.96
times 1.0% or 1.9%.  Since the differ-
ence, 22.1% (30.2% - 8.1%) is greater
than 1.9%, the difference would be
considered statistically significant.
The same procedure can be used to
test the significance of the difference
between estimates from the two
surveys.  For example, the standard
error of the difference between Federal
and State prison inmates carrying a
firearm would be 0.9%.  The
95-percent confidence interval around
the difference would be 1.96 times .9%
(or 1.7%).  Since the difference of
3.6% (18.4% minus 14.8%) is greater
than 1.6%, the difference would be
considered statistically significant.
All comparisons discussed in this
report were statistically significant at
the 95-percent confidence level.  
Definitions
The survey questionnaire used the
following definitions in language and
terms familiar to the respondents.
Interviewers read the definitions to 
the inmates when needed. 
Handguns include both pistols and 
revolvers.  They are firearms held and
fired with one hand and include the
following:
— Revolver is a handgun with a revolv-
ing cylinder with several cartridge
chambers.  The chambers are succes-
sively lined up with the barrel and then
discharged. (Classified as single shot
for analysis.)
— Derringer is a short-barreled, single
shot pocket pistol.  A pistol has a
chamber integral with the barrel.
(Classified as single shot for analysis.)
— A conventional semiautomatic pistol
uses a shell which is ejected and the
next round of ammunition is loaded
automatically from a magazine or clip
internal to the pistol grip or handle.
The trigger must be pulled for each
shot.5  (Classified as conventional
semiautomatic for analysis.)
— Military-style semiautomatic pistol 
is similar to a conventional semiauto-
matic pistol except that the magazine
or clip is visible.5  Primary examples
are the UZI, TEC-9, and MAC-10.
(Classified as military-style semiauto-
matic for analysis.)
A rifle is a firearm intended to be shot
from the shoulder.  It has a long barrel
which shoots bullets.  Types include:
— Bolt-action, pump-action, lever-
action, or single-shot rifles require
physical movement by the operator of
some part of the rifle — a bolt, lever, or
pump — to reload.  A single shot rifle
must be loaded after each shot.
(Classified as single shot for analysis.)
— Semiautomatic hunting-style rifle is
a rifle in which a shell is ejected and
the next round of ammunition is loaded
automatically from a magazine or clip.
The trigger must be pulled for each
shot. (Classified as conventional
semiautomatic for analysis.)
— Semiautomatic military-style rifle has
the characteristics of a semiautomatic
hunting-style rifle.  It also has military
features such as a pistol grip, folding
stock, flash suppressor, and bayonet
mount.  (Classified as military-style
semiautomatic for analysis.)
A shotgun is a firearm intended to be
shot from the shoulder with either a
single- or double-barrel for firing shot

(a concentration of small pellets) at
short ranges.  Types include:
— Bolt-action, pump-action, lever-
action, or single shot shotgun requires
physical movement by the operator of
some part of the shotgun — a bolt,
lever, or pump — to reload.  A single
shot shotgun must be loaded after
each shot.  (Classified as single-shot

— Semiautomatic hunting-style
shotgun is a shotgun in which a shell is
ejected and the next round of ammuni-
tion is loaded automatically from a
magazine or clip. The trigger must be
pulled for each shot. (Classified as
conventional semiautomatic for

— Semiautomatic military-style
shotgun has the characteristics of a
semiautomatic hunting-style shotgun.
In addition, the shotgun has military
features, such as a pistol grip, folding-
stock, and detachable magazine or
clip.  It looks like a semiautomatic
military-style rifle. (Classified as
military-style semiautomatic for

A semiautomatic gun is a firearm in
which a shell is ejected and the next
round of ammunition is loaded
automatically from a magazine or clip.
The trigger must be pulled for each
shot.  Semiautomatic guns may be
classified as handguns, rifles, or
shotguns. 
A machine gun is an automatic gun
which, if the trigger is held down, will
fire rapidly and continuously.  It is not a
semi-automatic gun for which the
trigger must be pulled for each shot. 
(Classified as fully automatic for
analysis.)
