Introduction
The AVIRIS On-Board Calibrator (OBC) provides essential data for refining the
calibration of each AVIRIS data run. Annual improvement to the AVIRIS sensor and
laborato~ calibration accuracy has resulted in increasingly high demands on the stability of
the OBC, Since the 1995 flight season, the OBC could track the stability of the
spectrometer alignment to the 2% level, a significant improvement over previous years.
The major contributor to this 2% stability was the conversion from a constant-current bulb
power supply to an intensity-based active feedback power supply. Given the high sensor
signal-to-noise ratio, improving the OBC to track 1% or 0.5% changes was highly
desirable. Achieving stability better than 2% required an examination of the mechanisms
affecting stability.

Historically, the OBC temperature has ranged between +1O”Cand +50”C, in-flight
minimum and in-laboratory maximum, respectively, Optical power variations caused by
changes in the temperature of the OBC are seen by the AVIRIS spectrometers and degrade
the utility of the OBC as a calibration source. The goal of thermal testing the AVIRIS OBC
was to quantify any changes in the optical output from the optical fiber bundle as the
temperature of its environment changes.
The on-board calibrator and its place in the AVIRIS sensor is shown in figure 1.
When the foreoptics shutter is closed light from the feedback stabilized tungsten source in
the on-board calibrator is carried through a fiber bundle to the back of the shutter and
reflected into the spectrometer data fibers. Fluctuations in the OBC temperature can distort
the OBC structure, causing the tungsten lamp to rnis-align and hence change the intensity of
the light reaching the spectrometers. The change in temperature of the OBC in-flight has
historically been as much as ilO°C.

Figure 2, Experimental Set-up
The OBC was placed in an environmental chamber such that thermal contact
between the chamber floor and the calibrator was eliminated; therefore, chamber air
provided the thermal transport as opposed to point contact with the cold chamber walls (see
figure 2). Optical fiber and power cables were fed through an opening and attached to the
OBC. Several OBC operating parameters were monitored, including light output through
the optical fiber, voltage across the light bulb, voltage across a O.lfJ resistor series (bulb
current), plus both OBC structure and ambient temperature (10mV/°C).Datawas logged
to an ASCII file using a Fluke Data Acquisition Unit. Optical power output was monitored
by a model NRC820 silicon detector with an optical filter and stored to the data file (output
was measured
as volts DC on an arbitrary scale).

Procedure
and Analysis
The test was performed four times with improvements to the set-up added each
time, For the first run, the OBC was not mounted on an aluminum plate (as usually
configured
on AVIRIS)
and the temperature
range was 10°C to 50°C. In this run, the OBC
output varied with small changes in temperature. Figure 3 shows oscillations in the OBC
out ut over regions where the OBC structure temperature is fairly stable. The bulb voltage
f
an current followed closely with the rise and fall of the temperatures and showed
oscillations as well, but at significantly smaller magnitudes.
The oscillations in the lamp
current are 1 mA in 2000 mA and 2 mV in 5000 mV for the bulb voltage. This is a power
variation of 2 Darts in 107while the oMical flux at the outrmt of the fiber bundle varied 3
parts in 103. ‘

Figure 3. First Run: Optical Output and Temperature vs. Time for OBC without a shear plate
As shown in figure 1,the lamp output is imaged onto the fiber bundle by a
spherical mirror after passing through the filter wheel. If the baseplate of the OBC
distorts, then the optical components will misalign, and the image of the bulb filament will
move off the fiber bundle input. This is the most likely cause of the oscillations seen in
figure 3.
For the seeond run, an aluminum plate was attached to the base of the OBC to more
closely simulate the enhanced structural rigidity of the OBC baseplate when it is attached to
the AVIIUS sensor’s forward panel in the normal flight configuration. The test was
terminated before completion because the temperature sensor readout became noisy and
unstable. The addition of a filter to the circuit at the data acquisition unit eliminated this
noise. The third test ranged in temperature from 20°C to 40°C (equilibrium was not
achieved at 40”C). A 10 nm FWHM, 450 nm center wavelength bartdpass filter was added
to minimize any room temperature responsivity variations from the NRC820 silicon
detector.
The fourth run was done over the same temperature range as the first run, adding
another temperature equilibrium region at 30°C (See Figure 4.). The equilibrium regions
lasted for at least 45 minutes and did not show the oscillations that were visible in the first
test. In this test, the OBC output was much more stable than in the first test.

Conclusion
A change in OBC structure temperature of 40”C leads to a change in optical output
of approximately 4% at 450 nm. Last year, the in-flight temperatures ranged between 25°C
and 45°C. If we assume AVIRIS will experience similar tem~rature
variations in the
future, the 20”C range would continue to yield an OBC light output uncertainty of 2%.
However, for regions where the temperature is stable the optical output variation is far less
than 2%. This is because temperature transients generate gradients that distort the OBC
structure and misalign the optics. Once the OBC reaehes thermal equilibrium, the optical
alignment is re-established, as is evident in the fourth test where the output deviation was
approximately 0.75% across each of the three temperature stable regions. Bulb voltage and
current followed the temperature changes very closely, indicating that the 543.5 nm filtered
silicon detector controlling the bulb has a residual output sensitivity to temperature, or that
the structure holding the bulb in alignment with that detector is not perfectly rigid. (see
Figures 5. and 6.) From these results, we decided to implement a thermal control system
to stabilize the OBC’S internal temperature to 40”C. This thermal stabilization will further
limit the variations in optical output to well below the 0.75% seen in the test.

Data from the flight season, as seen in figure 7, shows that the variation in the lamp
voltage was 0.47% while the lamp current varied by on]y O.19%, This slow increase in
bulb voltage and cument could arise from the slowly decreasing bulb quartz envelope
transmittance as tungsten is deposited on inside of the envelope. The halogen cycle does
minimize this deposition, but does not completely eliminate it, This increasing opacity
would result in less light exiting the bulb for a given power level. The intensity-based
closed-loop control compensates for this by increasing the power, thus the bulb output is
maintained. A slight color temperature change also results, but is not significant for the
variation seen here.
