MATTER OF: 
McGranahan -
Staying at Friends'
Apartment on TDY
V r 
DIGEST: 
A claim by a member of the military for
IA'e It4.7'z 
to 
r reimbursement of expenses incurred during 1DY
L-' 
t-espeT-_-y-tiey for lodging provided by f-f
friendmust be denied, even though the-
member paid his friend rent for the lodg-
ing, since Joint Travel Regulations
par. M4205-1 provides that under such
circumstances there may be no reimburse-
ment for the cost of lodgings.
By letter of April 2, 1980, an advance decision is
requested concerning the reimbursement of expenses for
lodging incurred by a member of the military during tem-
*1 
porary duty while staying at the apartment of a friend.
Since reimbursement is not permitted for expenses in-
curred by a member for lodging provided by a friend, the
claim is denied. 
The request for an advance decision was made by
Lieutenant (junior grade) S. R. Miller, disbursing
officer at Moffett Field, California, and was assigned
Control No. 80-13 by the Per Diem, Travel and
Transportation Allowance Committee.
For the period of August 20 through September 14,
1979, Lieutenant (junior grade) James 0. McGranahan was
on temporary duty in San Diego, California, for Legal
Officer School. Since Government quarters were not
available, Lieutenant McGranahan stayed in the apart-
ment of a friend, to whom he paid $300 in rent. He
31 
received no receipt for the payment from the apartment
owner or his friend, nor did he furnish any information
indicating increased costs incurred by his host due to
his stay at the apartment.
This situation is covered by Joint Travel Regu-
lations, par. M4205-1, which provides, in pertinent
part:

"If the member uses no lodging during
the temporary duty period or utilizes
lodging as a guest of friends or rela-
tives, then the average cost of lodging
is zero * * * 
n
This provision is established under the authority
granted to the Secretaries having jurisdiction over the
uniformed services by 37 U.S.C. ยง 404 (1976). The pur-
pose of the the prohibition against reimbursing friends
and relatives is to eliminate potential abuses from
occurring in connection with claims involving lodging
with friends or relatives.
The lodging here was obtained by Lieutenant McGranahan
from a friend. Although the friend expected payment for
permitting Lieutenant McGranahan to stay in his apart-
ment, the friend did not operate a commercial establish-
ment and this is the type of reimbursement against which
the regulation is aimed. Paragraph M4205-1 was revised
January 1, 1978, to its current form, but prior to that
paragraph M4205 (effective October 3, 1976) provided, in
pertinent part:
'If the member uses no lodging during
the temporary duty period or utilizes
lodging without cost, including as a
guest of friends or relatives, then
the average cost of lodging is zero * *
The current regulation as revised omitted the language
"without cost," indicating that a member may be a guest
even if there is some cost involved. Moreover, the Per
Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee
advises that the use of the term guest is unfortunate
and that the intent of the regulation is to allow zero
dollars for lodging whenever a traveler stays with a
friend or relative. This regulation was promulgated
pursuant to statutory authority and it must be followed.
Therefore, Lieutenant McGranahan is not entitled to
reimbursement for the lodging expenses he has claimed.

In accordance with the foregoing, the claim for
reimbursement must be denied.
