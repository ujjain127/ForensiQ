Description of Proposed Use:  To provide youth an opportunity and
an educational experience relating to fishing. This activity is permit-
ted to support a special event such as National Fishing Week to
introduce youth to the sport and let them “wet a line.” Fishing along
with environmental education programs are presented once or twice
a year. The practice of “catch and release” is followed. Consequently,
all fishing activity is supervised by Refuge staff and volunteers.
Fishing will be allowed only on the pond adjacent to the refuge
headquarter’s building and is limited to one or two annual special
events. Bank fishing during daylight hours is permitted during these
special events.
Species allowed to be taken and the permitted methods of taking will
be consistent with state regulations.
Refuge-specific regulations prohibit fishing, except for a special
event.

Justification:
Lake Erie has been referred to as the walleye capital of the world.
Consequently the fishing community represents a significant popula-
tion of anglers. However, Lake Erie fishing requires specialized
equipment not available to many people. Bank fishing on the Refuge
only requires the bare necessities. Likewise, some anglers prefer a
tranquil, wilderness fishing experience such as what the Refuge has
to offer. Since the fishing access is isolated from the major wildlife
use area and because of seasonal and fishing technique restrictions,
disturbance to wildlife is minimal.

Description of Proposed Use:  The controlled waterfowl hunt plan
identifies Canada, snow and white-fronted geese and ducks as
huntable species on the refuge. Hunting will take place only from
designated blinds located along the perimeter of the Ottawa unit.
Twelve blinds are proposed for use during the 2000 waterfowl
hunting season. However, the number and placement of blinds is
subject to annual review.
Refuge-specific regulations are:  1) Permits are required; 2) Hunting
hours are legal shooting time until 12 noon; 3) Hunter must report
back to check station and submit waterfowl for examination; 4) No
more than two hunters per blind and shooting must take place in
blind and/or within 75 yards of blind; and 5) Each hunter may not
possess more than 25 shells of nontoxic shot.
Waterfowl species allowed to be taken and the permitted methods of
taking will be consistent with Federal and State regulations.
In addition to the regulations stated above, the hunt is scheduled for
4 days per week, usually Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
A cooperative agreement provides for the hunt to be administered
by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife,
and they conduct the permitting process and blind maintenance.

Statewide the giant Canada goose population has increased to the
point that Ohio conducts an early nuisance goose hunting season.
Additionally, wildlife managers expend a lot of time and dollars
responding to goose depredation complaints, transporting nuisance
geese from unwanted areas, and issuing landowners goose scare-
away devices. Without a hunting program, this population will
denude habitat for other wetland-dependent species as well as
impact the surrounding agricultural fields.

hike/bicycle on a daily basis during daylight hours. The trails are
composed of dike-top roads surrounding moist soil units, open pools,
and foot trails meandering through woodlots. Interpretive panels
and bench sites provide management and wildlife information to the
visitor. An elevated (5 feet high) platform was constructed along one
of the trails and this was designated as a “watchable wildlife” area.
The trail system has been designated as a National Recreation Trail.

Statewide, the white-tailed deer population has increased to the
point that Ohio conducts special antlerless deer and urban-zone
hunting programs to supplement harvest during the regular season.
These additional programs are designed to meet population target
level objectives and fulfill management direction.
The population estimate at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge was
determined from a winter white-tailed deer helicopter survey.  Our
estimates indicate that our current deer population is at 47.3 deer/
mi2.  In Ohio, buck harvest goals are based on landowner attitudes
and desires, and deer-vehicle collision statistics.  Extrapolation from
Ohio’s figures indicate pre-harvest density estimates for Lucas and
Ottawa counties are 0.6 and 0.9 deer/square mile (unpubl. rep., Ohio
Division of Wildlife 1993).  In the Midwest agricultural region,
statewide deer densities range from 1-15 deer/square mile
(Gladfelter 1984).  Our population estimate is 315% above the upper
end of average densities reported for the agricultural Midwest
region.  DeCalesta (1994) suggested threshold deer densities for
effect on habitat and songbirds within managed (100-year rotation)
forests to be between 7.9 and 14.9 deer/km2.  This converts to 5 and 9
deer/mi2 at the lower and upper ends of the threshold scale, respec-
tively.
Wildlife managers expend a lot of time and dollars responding to
deer-vehicle accident and crop depredation complaints.  Without a
hunting program specifically used as a management tool, the refuge
deer population may degrade habitat quality not only for that
population, but for other important species.  Additionally, the popula-
tion is expected to impact the surrounding agricultural fields.

Justification: Sport hunting has been a long-standing tradition in the
Lake Erie marshes region.  Public interest, especially from the local
agricultural community, supports the white-tailed deer population
reduction goal.  Statewide, the white-tailed deer population has
increased to the point that Ohio conducts special antlerless deer and
urban-zone hunting programs to supplement harvest during the
regular season.
The white-tailed deer population (47.3 deer/mi2) at Ottawa National
Wildlife Refuge exceeds Ohio’s pre-harvest density estimates (0.6
and 0.9 deer/mi2) for Lucas and Ottawa counties and the Midwest
agricultural region’s statewide deer density ranges (1-15 deer/mi2).
It also exceeds the threshold deer densities for effect on habitat and
songbirds within managed (100-year rotation) forests (5-9 deer/mi2).
Without a hunting program specifically used as a management tool,
the refuge deer population is expected to adversely affect associated
plant and animal communities, and hence alter ecological diversity
and succession (Warren 1991).  This may result in significant nega-
tive impacts on both plant and other animal communities including
some of special concern or of Service trust responsibility.  This
impact has been well documented and accepted through research
over a period of many years.  A list of literature citations used to
develop this compatibility determination is attached.  The white-
tailed deer hunting plan objectives will ultimately result in a deer
density of 15 deer/mi2.  This deer density will maintain the refuge
deer population at the upper limit of a reasonable equilibrium with
its environment as estimated for the Midwest agricultural region.
Antlerless deer harvest will be based on these considerations: status
of management unit deer population in relation to goals (at goal,
higher, or lower) as determined by inventories; and past effects of
varying antlerless deer harvest levels on populations (gained
through experience).  As recommended by Creed et al. (1984), an
antlerless deer to buck harvest ratio will eventually be established to
maintain deer densities at optimum levels after initial herd reduc-
tion.  Winter severity is not assumed to be limiting at the refuge’s
latitude and accordingly, such information is not used in southern
Appendix D:  Draft Compatibility Determinations
D-14
Michigan or Ohio.  Therefore, the available lower Winter Severity
Index values will be used to establish future harvest ratios.
Disturbance to other species of refuge wildlife will be minimal
because the hunt will be held during periods of low migratory bird
use.  This disturbance will be periodic and of short duration.  No
evidence exists that such activity causes biological problems for
these other species.  The population reduction is expected to affect
good health in the refuge deer herd and greatly reduce disease
potential and nutritional deficiency problems.
