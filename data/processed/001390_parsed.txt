SUMMARY
A
single
chart
has
been
prepared
that
simplifies
the
calculation
of the
thermodynamic
properties
of
air,
various‚Äù
octene-air
mixtures,
and
mixtures
of
those
with
their
prod-
ucts
of
combustion
at
all
temperatures
below
which
chemical
dissociation
becomes
unimportant.
The
chart
is
based
on
the
4
use
of
1 pound
mol
of
mixture,
and
examples
of
its
use
are
given
in
the
farm
of
the

and

INTRODUCTION
Reference
1 presented
thermodynamic
property
charts
for
the
products
of
combustion
of
octene
and
air
in
different
ratios.
For
the
calculation
of various
engine
cycles,
there
is
necessary
in
addition
a
chart
or
set
qf
charts
giving
the
thermodynamic
properties
of unburned
air-fuel
mixtures.
Such
an unburned-fuel-air
mixture
chart
has
been
calculated,
and
so
plotted
that
it
applies
to various
air-fuel
ratios
and
various
ratios
of burned
to unburned
gases,
and
includes
pure
air
as
the
basic
chart.
This
investigation,
\
conducted
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of !Te‚Äùchnology, was
sponsored
by
and
conducted
with
‚Äú
the
financial
assistance
of the
National
Advisory
Oommittee
G
for
Aeronautics.
The
completion
of
this
project
would
not
have
been
pos-
eible
without
the
conscientious
and
efficient
assistance
of
Mrs.
Edward
Addelson,
who
made
all
the
calculations
and
did
all
the
drafting
and
lettering
on
the
ftnal
charts.

FUNDA!!EN!J!ALDATA
The
ch~rts
in
reference
1
were
each
on a basis
of 1
pound
of
air
plus
the
appropriate
fuel,
and
the
coordinates
were
entropy
S
and
internal
energy
E.
A
set
of correspond-‚Äô
ing
‚Äòtunturned~! charts
on
the
same
basis
could
be
prepared,
one
corresponding
to
each
l;burnedlf chart.
If,
however,
the
basis
for
the
properties
of un%urned
mixtures
Is
not
1 pound
of air
but
1 pound
mol
of mixture,
the
p-v-T
relations
for
various
mixture
ratios
are
substantially
the
same
- identical,
of
course,
if
the
various
air-fuel
mixtures
were
perfect
gages .
Furthermore,
if
the
coordinates
of the
chart
are
entropy
S
and
temperature
T
rather
than
S
and
3
as
previously,
the
representation
of
the
properties
of differ‚Äùenk‚Äù mixture-ii on
a
single
chart
is
facilitated.
It
will
be
shown
that
the
small
variations,
with
air-fuel
mixture
ratios,
from
a--common
p-v-T
relation
due
to
gas
imperfections
and
from
a common
H-T
or E-!!!relation
due
to
raolal-specific-heat
variations‚Äù
from
fuel
to
air,
can
be
allowed
for
on
a
single
chart.
Such
a
chart
can
then
be
used
for
all
mixtures,
burned
or unburned
and
including
pure
air,
at
the
temperatures
of
intereet
here
(UP

1800¬∞

(1340¬∞
F)
for
unburned
fuel-air
mixtures$
2520¬∞
R
(2060¬∞

for
burned
mixtures).
Although
such
a
single
chart
has
the
disadvantage
over
a
series
of
charts
that
a change
in
basis
is
i~volved
during‚Äù‚Äù -
the
calculation
of
some
thermodynamic
o cles,
that
change
ts
Y
not
difficult
(an
example
will
be
given
: furthermore,
the
advantages
of
a
siri~le chart
are
many.
Besides
the
physical
simplification
of handling
a
Single
chart
there
is the
possi-
bility
of
calculation
of
complete
gas
turbine
cycles
of
any
mixture
ratio
of present
interest
instead
of
only
those
reties
for
which
burned
charts
are
available!
a
comparison
of
the
air-standard
cycle
with
the
actual
fuel
cycle
can
be
made
di-
rectly
on
the
single
chart;
the
chart
gi.ve,sdirectly
the
prop-
erties
of nure
air
for
calculation
of various
pumping
or
power
cycles.
In
the
previous
charts
zero
values
were
assigned
to
va-
‚Äò
rious
thermodynamic
properties
at
a base
of
100¬∞

Since
calculations
of htgh-altitude
power-plant
performance
will
involve
the
present
chart
at
temperatures
to
-60¬∞
F
or
lower,
It
is
desirable
to
drop
the
temperature
base
to
a value
below
any
anticipateri
in
order
to
involve
differences
of pos-
itive

in

Used
as
a Mixture
Chart
The
use
of
the
chart
in determining
the
properties
of
ELII
air‚Äîfuel
mixture
will
next
be
described,
without
inclusion
of
the
thermodynamic
basis
for
the
procedure.
Suppose
the
mix‚Äì
ture
contains
20
percent
more
fuel
than
the
stcichiometric
mixture.
Then
F =
1,20.
The
mixture
may,
in addition,
con‚Äì
sist
in part
of
unpurged
combustion
products
from
the
previ‚Äî
ous
cycle
in an
Otto
cycle
enginel
together
with
some
fresh
fuel‚Äîair
mixture,
The
weight
fraction
of
the
former
in the
total
mixture
is referred
to
as
f,
the-tfunpurged
fraction,-m
‚Äú‚Äú
or
weight‚Äîfraction
of
the
fuel
in the
burned
state.
For
Otto‚Äìcycle
calculations,
f
may
vary
from
0.01
to
0.05;
for
combustion
in a
gas
turbine
cycle,
f
is
C
on
entry
and
about
1.0
cn
learing.
AS
an
example,
consider
a mixture
with
l‚Äô=
1.2
and
f =
0.05,
at
a
temperature
9f 9500
R
and
pres-
sure
of
100
psia.
From
figure
5,
one
pound
of
air
pro-duces
0.03545
mols
of
such
a mixture.
This
is
the
conversion
factor
in going
from
the
present
chart
to
the
burned
charts,
(See
reference
1.)
Because
in many
problems
the
oxYgen
of.
the
air
is partially
or
wholly
cambined
with
fuel,
the
ordinate
of
figure
5
is
labeled
‚ÄòIpound mols
of
mixture
per
pound
of
air
constituents.‚Äù
From
the
main
chart,
at
T = 950¬∞
R
and
P
=
100,
‚Äòair
=
102.
This
volume
applies
for
airt
Since
the
p‚Äìv‚ÄîT
relations
for
air
and
for
the
mixture
are
somewhat
different,
a
correction
is read
from
figure
7;
Vmix
‚Äî
Valr
=
0.G7,
Vmix
=
102.O7,
Since
the
uncorrected
volume
can
be
read
tc no
better
than
1/2
per~ent~
the
correction
at
this
temperature
and
pressure
is
obvtously
not
worth
making,
To
obtain
enthalpy,
first
determine
Ho
from
the
right‚Äì
hand
scale
by
moving
horizontally
along
the
T + 9~o-line
to _
F
=
1.2;
and
interpolate
between
the
dashed‚Äîline
scales
cor‚Äî
responding
to
an
f
of
0,05,
finding
Ho
= 4590.
Similarly,
MO =
2690
(linear
interpolation
and
~Xtrap:~a~i::lare
valid
for
obtaining
values
at
f
other
than
O
.
From
figure
2A,
(H ‚Äì
Ho)/P
= ‚ÄìOt08
and
(E
‚Äì
Eo)/P
= ‚Äì6.1?.
Then,
H = 4590
‚Äì
0.08
x
100‚Äô=
4582,
lGO
=
2678.
and
fi =
2690
‚Äì
0,12
X
The
corrections,
for
this
exam~le,
were
barely
worth
making,
The
only
additional
property
of
interest
is
entroPY,
Absolute
values
of
entro~y
for
mixtures
do
not
appear
on
the
chart;
but
a
ohange
in
entropy
along
a
specified
path
or
the
change
in other
properties
alopg
a p%th
of
constant
entroPY
‚Äî
‚Äî
may
be
evaluated.
The
variation,
with
temperature
and
pres-
sure,
of
the
entrepy
of
a mixture
differs
from
that
of pure
air
because
of dtfferenees
in
specific
heats
and
in p-v-T
relations
fer
the
two.
Allowance

the

in

of curves
running
almost
vertically
aleng
the
left
aide
of
the
chart,
la%eled
(Smix

and
plotted
against
temperature.
Allowance
for
the
effeet
of differences
in p-v-T
relatioas
of air
and
of
gas
mixtures
is
much
less
tmportant,
and
may
be
neglected
for
many
uses
of
the
chart.
(See
later
example
.)

The
entropy
of air
at
the

is
fpund
to be
2.99,
and
the
difference
between
the
entropy
of
the
mixture
of
interest
and
that
of

(exclusive
ef
a

which

from
