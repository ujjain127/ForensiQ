THE NEW VISITOR EXPERIENCE AT GETTYSBURG NATIONAL MILITARY PARK 
FACTS AT A GLANCE 
 
Gettysburg National Military Park offers visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in the 
history and culture of the Civil War and the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg.  Each year, nearly two 
million visitors explore the site of this pivotal Civil War battle and the place where President 
Abraham Lincoln outlined the future of the nation in his Gettysburg Address.  Visitors who 
experience Gettysburg National Military Park will leave with an understanding of the scope 
and magnitude of the sacrifices made by soldiers and civilians alike, which ultimately gave 
way to a new birth of freedom for our country.  It is “Our Country’s Common Ground.”   
Through a combination of new construction and rehabilitation projects, the Gettysburg 
Foundation and the National Park Service have embarked on a massive campaign that will 
return the historic integrity of the site and further educational opportunities available to visitors.

Museum and Visitor Center at Gettysburg National Military Park

THE DAVID WILLS HOUSE 
AT GETTYSBURG NATIONAL MILITARY PARK 
 
In honor of Abraham Lincoln’s 200th birthday on February 12, 2009, the David Wills House in 
downtown Gettysburg will celebrate its Grand Opening, offering visitors a world-class museum 
experience that tells the story of Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address.   Grand Opening events 
will take place from February 12 - 16, 2009.   
 
David Wills’ home was not just the center of Gettysburg -- it was the center of the immense 
clean-up process after the Battle of Gettysburg and where President Lincoln put the finishing 
touches on the Gettysburg Address.  The speech transformed Gettysburg's community from a 
place of devastation to the symbol of our nation's new birth of freedom. 
 
The museum features six galleries, including two rooms that have been restored to their 1863 
appearance:  Wills' office, where he received letters from families looking for loved ones after 
the battle and began planning for a cemetery and its dedication; and the bedroom where Lincoln 
stayed and prepared to deliver the Gettysburg Address. 
 
Main Street Gettysburg will operate the museum, as an official partner with Gettysburg National 
Military Park.  The property is on the National Register of Historic Places.

THE NEW GETTYSBURG MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR 
The new Gettysburg Museum of the American Civil War offers visitors a 21st-century museum 
experience that tells the story of the Battle of Gettysburg and its significance to our nation’s 
history, within the context of the causes and consequences of the Civil War. The museum 
showcases an extensive collection of artifacts and archival materials and provides visitors with 
a distinctive perspective of the Civil War through the words of its participants and spectators, 
including Presidents Lincoln and Davis, Generals Meade and Lee, soldiers, correspondents 
and civilians. Through a variety of exhibits, interactive displays, films, and a host of research 
resources, the new Gettysburg Museum of the American Civil War provides a Civil War 
experience unlike any other. 
¾ Features: 
- 
A rotunda and museum lobby that set the stage for the museum experience. 
 
Of the 12 galleries in the new Gettysburg Museum of the American 
Civil War, 11 are based on phrases from Lincoln’s Gettysburg 
Address and organized to help visitors understand and appreciate the 
museum’s major themes, including the Gettysburg Campaign, the 
Civil War, and its causes and consequences.  With more than 
300,000 objects and artifacts and 700,000 archival materials, the 
collection at Gettysburg National Military Park is one of the most 
extensive in the world.   
- 
Interactive stations and hands-on experiences will be located throughout the 
museum.  Five of the galleries include short video presentations on the causes of the 
war, the three days of Battle at Gettysburg, and the results of the war.  The two 
Voices theaters feature readings from battle participants.   
- 
The twelfth gallery, a Special Exhibits Gallery showcases temporary and traveling 
exhibits to broaden the number of topics covered in the museum.  The current 
exhibit, “I Take Up My Pen,” includes a collection of soldiers’ letters from Gilder 
Lehrman Institute of American History, illustrated with artifacts from the park’s 
collection. 
 
The museum is located within the new Museum and Visitor Center at Gettysburg National 
Military Park.  The $103 million facility, which opened in April 2008, has been designed to 
help prepare visitors for their stay in Gettysburg, while at the same time offering such 21st-
century amenities as: 
- 
A computer resource room that gives visitors access to information about the 
people, the battle, the collection, and the monuments – all of which make Gettysburg 
an excellent educational experience. 
- 
The Ford Motor Company Fund Education Center — multi-purpose educational 
facilities — the center provides dedicated space for teacher workshops, classroom 
use and distance learning programs.  
- 
The Refreshment Saloon is a museum café with an outdoor dining terrace that 
offers visitors the opportunity to experience Civil War-era foods and recipes, and 
learn about the vital role played by the volunteers who supplemented government-
issue rations.  
- 
A Museum Bookstore that includes an extensive selection of Gettysburg, Civil War, 
and Lincoln-related titles for all ages, as well as a variety of Gettysburg-related gifts 
and memorabilia. 
The new Museum and Visitor Center at Gettysburg National Military Park has been designed 
to meet LEED performance certification at the silver level, in support of Foundation and 
National Park Service environmental and sustainability goals.  LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) certification is determined by the U.S. Green Building Council, 
which sets voluntary standards for high performance, sustainable buildings.

GETTYSBURG CYCLORAMA PAINTING 
 
The colossal circular oil painting, entitled “The Battle of Gettysburg,” depicts a pivotal moment in 
America’s history: the charge of Confederate infantry led by General George Pickett on July 3, 
1863.  This painting-in-the-round serves as a vivid monument to the soldiers on both sides who 
took part in the battle.  Now complete — once again— with three-dimensional diorama and a 
sky that disappears into an overhead canopy, the painting is designed to give viewers the 
illusion that they are standing in the middle of Pickett’s charge. Grown men were said to have 
wept when they viewed this stirring example of state-of-the-art entertainment from the late 19th 
century.   
 
One of only two Cyclorama paintings in the U.S. and about 20 worldwide, the new Gettysburg 
Cyclorama experience offers the only historically accurate venue in the country.   
 
¾ Artist: “The Battle of Gettysburg” was painted in 1883-1884 by French master Paul 
Philippoteaux and a team of 20 artists. 
¾ Conservation Effort: In 2003, after nearly a century of neglect and deterioration, the 
Gettysburg Cyclorama painting began a five-year conservation effort to return the work of 
art to its original glory.  The project is the largest-ever of its kind in North America and is 
being directed by the Gettysburg Foundation, in partnership with Gettysburg National 
Military Park.  The project includes not only conservation of the massive painting, but also 
recreation of 12 feet of sky, the three-dimensional diorama and the canopy, all of which 
have been lost for more than a century.   
¾ Cost:  The total cost of the project is $15 million.  This includes not only the conservation 
of the painting, but also the new hanging system, lighting, the canopy and diorama, a new 
sound and light program and exhibits in the gallery’s mezzanine level about the painting’s 
history and conservation. 
¾ Size: Before conservation began in 2003, the painting measured 356 feet by 26 feet.  
Now, the painting has been returned to its original circumference of 377 feet at its widest 
points and 42 feet high.  The painting, with its new backing and hanging system, weighs 
12.5 tons. 
¾ The Program:  Visitors begin with a viewing of the 22-minute film, A New Birth of 
Freedom.  Sponsored by the History Channel and narrated by Morgan Freeman and 
featuring the voices of Sam Waterston and Marcia Gay Harden, the film tells the story of 
the Battle of Gettysburg and the war that changed the nation.  From the film, visitors will 
ascend three stories to the Cyclorama Gallery, where they will be immersed in the 
climactic moment of the three-day battle — Pickett’s charge.  A sound and light program 
will bring the scene to life.

THE GETTYSBURG BATTLEFIELD 
 
More than 165,000 soldiers fought with Union and Confederate armies on the battlefield at 
Gettysburg National Military Park.  The battle lasted three days — July 1, 2 and 3, 1863, and 
raged through the town and the surrounding countryside.  The largest battle ever fought in North 
America saw more than 51,000 soldiers killed, wounded or captured.  Today, the Gettysburg 
Battlefield receives nearly two million visitors annually, who come from all over the world to 
learn about its historical significance, and to view its natural beauty.  
¾ Battlefield Rehabilitation: The Battlefield is undergoing a multi-year, multi-million dollar 
rehabilitation to restore Gettysburg’s historic integrity and enhance visitor understanding of 
and appreciation for what happened here in July 1863.  Battlefield rehabilitation also will 
help create a sustainable environment by improving wetlands, water quality and wildlife 
habitat.  
¾ Battlefield Monuments and Memorials:  The Gettysburg Battlefield is the site of 1,328 
monuments and memorials, the largest collection of outdoor sculpture in the world.  
¾ Size: 6,000 acres  
The Gettysburg Foundation, including the members of the Friends of Gettysburg, is 
providing financial support for the park’s battlefield rehabilitation programs.  The Friends of 
Gettysburg has, to date, preserved more than 500 acres of threatened battlefield land.  It also 
helps fund the removal of modern-day intrusions, including burial of power lines, the rebuilding 
of fences and removal of the outdate buildings and parking areas along Cemetery Ridge.    
 
SOLDIERS’ NATIONAL CEMETERY                                                                
AT GETTYSBURG NATIONAL MILITARY PARK 
The Soldiers’ National Cemetery at Gettysburg National Military Park was established as the 
final resting place for Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg, as well as for soldiers, veterans 
and dependents from the Civil War through Vietnam.  It was officially closed in 1972.  It was at 
the November 19, 1863, dedication of the cemetery, before a crowd of approximately 15,000 
dignitaries, soldiers and civilians, that President Abraham Lincoln delivered the remarks the 
world knows today as the Gettysburg Address.
