Abstract
Fireﬁghting, along with construction, mining and agriculture, ranks among the most dangerous occupations. In addition, the work
environment of ﬁreﬁghters is unlike that of any other occupation, not only because of the obvious physical hazards but also due to
the respiratory and systemic health hazards of smoke inhalation resulting from combustion. A signiﬁcant amount of research has
been devoted to studying municipal ﬁreﬁghters; however, these studies may not be useful in wildland ﬁreﬁghter exposures, because
the two work environments are so different. Not only are wildland ﬁreﬁghters exposed to different combustion products, but their
exposure proﬁles are different.
The combustion products wildland ﬁreﬁghters are exposed to can vary greatly in characteristics due to the type and amount of
material being burned, soil conditions, temperature and exposure time. Smoke inhalation is one of the greatest concerns for ﬁreﬁghter
health and it has been shown that the smoke consists of a large number of particles. These smoke particles contain intermediates of
hydrogen, carbon and oxygen free radicals, which may pose a potential health risk.
Our investigation looked into the involvement of free radicals in smoke toxicity and the relationship between particle size and
radical generation. Samples were collected in discrete aerodynamic particle sizes from a wildﬁre in Alaska, preserved and then
shipped to our laboratory for analysis. Electron spin resonance was used to measure carbon-centered as well as hydroxyl radicals
produced by a Fenton-like reaction with wildﬁre smoke. Further study of reactive oxygen species was conducted using analysis of
cellular H2O2 generation, lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes and DNA damage. Results demonstrate that coarse size-range
particles contained more carbon radicals per unit mass than the ultraﬁne particles; however, the ultraﬁne particles generated more
•OH radicals in the acellular Fenton-like reaction. The ultraﬁne particles also caused signiﬁcant increases in H2O2 production by
monocytes and lipid peroxidation. All particle sizes showed the ability to cause DNA damage. These results indicate that the radical
generation and the damage caused by them is not only a function of surface area but is also inﬂuenced by changing chemical and
other characteristics due to particle size.

extremely hazardous working conditions during ﬁre sup-
pression activities at wildland ﬁres (Ward et al., 1989).
Fireﬁghting ranks among the most dangerous occupa-
tions, along with construction, mining and agriculture
(Leigh, 1995; US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2003).
The work environment of ﬁreﬁghters is unlike that of
any other occupation, not only because of the obvious
physical hazards but also due to the respiratory and sys-
temic health hazards from smoke inhalation resulting
from combustion (Jankovic et al., 1991; Lees, 1995).
Fireﬁghters, both municipal (structural) and wildland,
are known to have respiratory problems (Musk et al.,
1982; Materna et al., 1992). Much research has been
devoted to the deleterious effects of smoke exposure
in municipal ﬁreﬁghters (Burgess et al., 2001; Chia et
al., 1990; Scannell and Balmes, 1995; Bergstrom et al.,
1997). Those results, however, may not be generaliz-
able to wildland (grass, brush and forest) ﬁreﬁghters,
given the difference in smoke composition, the longer
duration of exposures for wildland ﬁreﬁghters and the
fact that municipal ﬁreﬁghters routinely wear respira-
tory protection while wildland ﬁreﬁghters do not. Due
to these differences the exposure levels of municipal
and wildland ﬁreﬁghters to airborne contaminants can
be expected to differ. Wildland ﬁreﬁghters are not likely
to experience the extreme acute exposures that structural
ﬁreﬁghters may encounter while working in conﬁned
spaces. However, they may spend several days or weeks
working in smoke for shifts of 12 h or longer. Use
of a self-contained breathing apparatus is not feasible,
and respiratory protection consists primarily of ban-
dannas tied over the nose and mouth (Sutton et al.,
1990).
Previous studies of wildland ﬁreﬁghters showed
cross-season changes in prevalence of one or more
respiratory symptom(s) (Rothman et al., 1991; Liu et
al., 1992; Betchley et al., 1997). Respiratory problems
are estimated to affect 5–10% of wildland ﬁreﬁghters.
Studies of forest ﬁreﬁghters have shown both short-
and long-term effects on their pulmonary functions
(Rothman et al., 1991; Serra et al., 1996). Another
study (Jalava et al., 2006) found major differences
between the coarse and ultraﬁne particles in proinﬂam-
matory cytokines production and apoptosis in RAW
264.7 cells. However, differences in MTT tests and NO
production were relatively small. The study suggests
that the aerosol smoke particles, which had undergone
long-range transport, had chemically transformed during
aging.
Smoke is the most obvious product of combus-
tion and by far the most complex. While smoke can
be viewed simplistically as partially combusted car-
bonaceous material, it is really a complicated array
of organic and inorganic compounds originating from
the combusted material, decomposed from the origi-
nal material or formed from the combustion process
(Large et al., 1990). Combustion chemistry predicts that
the majority of the reactive intermediates generated in
ﬁres will be free radicals (Bizovi and Leikin, 1995;
Lowry et al., 1985; MacFarland, 1968; Pryor et al.,
1990). The chemical intermediates generated are usu-
ally in the form of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen free
radicals (Tuve, 1976). These free radicals have been
suggested to be involved in mechanisms involved in
bronchopulmonary carcinogenesis, ﬁbrogenesis, inﬂam-
mation and toxicity (Shi et al., 1994; Leonard et al.,
2004a,b). Previous investigations have identiﬁed wood
smoke as a source of free radicals (Yamaguchi et al.,
1992; Lowry et al., 1985; Leonard et al., 2000). Free radi-
cal mechanisms have been implicated in general toxicity,
inﬂammation, ﬁbrogenesis, bronchopulmonary carcino-
genesisandatheroscleroticplaqueformation(Vallyathan
et al., 1995). It has been demonstrated that smoke gen-
erated in wood ﬁres also generates carbon-centered free
radical species. Carbon-centered free radicals have been
shown to initiate reactions in the bronchopulmonary tree,
where inhaled smoke particles deposit (Lachoki et al.,
1989).
Investigations have suggested that oxygen-derived
free radicals and their metabolites, reactive oxygen
species (ROS), are important mediators of pulmonary
injury, including asthma (Jarjour and Calhoun, 1994),
adult respiratory distress syndrome (Gonzalez et al.,
1996; McCord et al., 1994), pulmonary ﬁbrosis and
inﬂammation caused by exposure to asbestos (Kamp et
al., 1992; Goodglick and Kane, 1986) or silica (Tuomala
et al., 1992; Vallyathan et al., 1995). Earlier studies
(Kimura et al., 1988; Traber et al., 1989; Brown et al.,
1988) have suggested a role of free radicals in smoke
inhalation injury but have not identiﬁed the types of
free radicals involved or the biological mechanism of
action. Wildﬁre smoke has been associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial
asthma (Jalava et al., 2006; Mott et al., 2005).
In March 2004, a pilot study was initiated by NIOSH
to assess the feasibility of collecting medical and envi-
ronmental exposure data preseason, in a wildﬁre setting
and post-season. The National Interagency Fire Center
arranged for the National Park Service Alpine Inter-
agency Hotshot Crew (IHC) of the Rocky Mountain
National Park (n = 20 total ﬁreﬁghters) to participate in
the pilot study. In the summer of 2004, NIOSH staff
accompanied the Alpine IHC to the Boundary Fire in
Fox, AK. The Boundary Fire was the fourth largest

ﬁre of 2004 burning a total of 537,098 acres from
6/20/04 to 9/3/04 and we used this ﬁre as a representative
sampling of the possible types of smoke wildland ﬁre-
ﬁghters can be exposed to and conditions they would deal
with.
We hypothesize that free radicals are associated with
wildﬁre smoke and that particle size plays a role in the
type of radicals generated. Furthermore, these radicals
are related to hydrogen peroxide generation, and have
the ability to cause lipid peroxidation and DNA strand
breaks. Our hypothesis will be tested by performing
experiments related to the following speciﬁc aims: (1)
determine and quantify particle-induced ROS associated
with particle size using a cell-free model. (2) Deﬁne the
mechanism and types of radicals involved in the process.
(3) Determine if cellular exposure to wildland ﬁre can
cause activation of redox systems. (4) Determine if wild-
land ﬁre smokes samples have the ability to cause DNA
strand breaks associated with ROS. The major goals of
the present study are focused on answering these ques-
tions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagents
Chelex 100 chelating resin was purchased from Bio-
Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA, USA). Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (KH2PO4 (1.06 mM), Na2HPO4 (5.6 mM), NaCl
(154 mM), pH 7.4), was purchased from Biowhittaker Inc.
(Walkersville, MD, USA). The PBS was treated with chelex
100 to remove transition metal ion contaminants. Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagles medium (DMEM), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-
oxide (DMPO), fetal bovine serum (FBS), FeSO4, H2O2 and
penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Sigma Chemi-
cal Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). The spin trap, DMPO,
was puriﬁed by charcoal decolorization and vacuum distilla-
tion and was free of ESR detectable impurities. Quartz sample
tubes were purchased from Wilmad Glass (Buena, NJ, USA).
DNA fragments,  Hind III, were purchased from Invitro-
gen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Vistra green nucleic acid stain
was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ,
USA).
2.2. Cell culture
RAW 264.7 mouse peritoneal monocytes were purchased
from American type culture collection (Rockville, MD). RAW
264.7 cells are commonly used and have been found to respond
to particle exposure in a manner similar to primary alveolar
macrophages (Hiura et al., 1999; Jalava et al., 2006; Leonard
et al., 2000, 2004a,b; Li et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). RAW
264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 2 mM
l-glutamine and 50 mg/ml pen/strep at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2 incu-
bator. Cells were split after conﬂuence approximately every 3
days.
2.3. Smoke sampling
Six sets of aerodynamically size-selected aerosol sam-
ples were collected with the Micro-Oriﬁce Uniform Deposit
Impactor (MOUDI) model# 110 with rotator (MSP, Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) at wildﬁre mop-up and back-burn
operations over the course of 5 days. These operations are
deﬁned as—mop-up: to make a ﬁre safe or reduce residual
smoke after the ﬁre has been controlled by extinguishing or
removing burning material along or near the control line and
back-burn: a ﬁre set along the inner edge of a ﬁre line to
consume the fuel in the path of a wildﬁre and/or change the
direction of force of the ﬁre’s convection column. The MOUDI
is an 11-stage research-grade cascade impactor (including a
ﬁnal ﬁlter to collect particles <0.056 m). Filters used were
from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA, USA) 47 mm, 0.8 m,
PVC model PVC0847600. PVC was selected because it was
previously demonstrated to have no effect in the analysis. The
MOUDI substrates are normally coated with grease to ensure
adherence of deposited particles and to avoid bounce of large
particles to lower stages of the impactor. However, grease
can alter the surface of collected aerosol particles and is not
suitable for use in collecting samples for free radical anal-
ysis. Therefore, the cascade impactor was operated without
grease substrates to collect and fractionate the smoke aerosol.
This approach was based on the assumption that the tarry
nature of smoke particles would negate major concerns for
particle bounce or entrainment. The MOUDI samplers were
placed as close to the ﬁre as was permitted by the hotshot
crews in regard to safety of the ﬁreﬁghters and the NIOSH
personnel taking the samples. The samplers were supported
on a tripod of steel legs in order to place the sampling inlet
approximately 5 ft off the ground to simulate breathing space
of a ﬁreﬁghter. The average sampling time was 3.5 h. The
long sampling time was required in order to obtain sufﬁcient
mass within the time period of ﬁreﬁghter exposure. Particle
bounce, particularly in the larger sizes, may have been an
issue due to the long sampling time. The mass concentration
of particulates ranged from 0.75 to 1.3 mg/m3. Filters were
immediately placed on dry ice and shipped to NIOSH for
temporary storage at −80 ◦C until free radical analysis was
performed.
Filter suspensions, which were used for H2O2, lipid perox-
idation and DNA damage analysis, were prepared by splitting
the ﬁlters into three size groups. For this study, the size groups
were deﬁned as ultraﬁne (0.042–0.24 m), ﬁne (0.42–2.4 m)
and coarse (4.2–24 m) particles. The groups consisted of four
ﬁlters each of which were placed in PBS and blended on ice
into ﬁne slurry using a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products Inc.,
Racine, WI). Pre- and post-ﬁlter weights were used to calculate
a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/ml smoke suspension. The slurry
was centrifuged, and the smoke suspension was decanted from
the ﬁlter pellet. A clean control suspension was also prepared
at a ratio of 4 ﬁlters/1 ml PBS.

2.4. Free radical measurements
ESR spin trapping was used to detect both carbon radi-
cals and short-lived free radical intermediates. Carbon radicals
were measured directly by placing the ﬁlter into a 5 mm quartz
sample tube and placing it in the ESR cavity. Hydroxyl radicals
were measured using the addition-type reaction of a short-lived
radical with a paramagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a rel-
atively long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which can
then be studied using conventional ESR. For hydroxyl radical
measurements, reactants were mixed in test tubes at a ﬁnal
volume of 1.0 ml of PBS in the presence of 1 mM H2O2. The
reaction mixture was then transferred to a ﬂat cell for ESR mea-
surement. Experiments were performed at room temperature
and under ambient air.
The concentrations given in the ﬁgure legends are ﬁnal
concentrations. The intensity of the signal is used to measure
the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, and the hyperﬁne
couplings of the spin adduct are characteristic of the origi-
nal trapped radicals. Spin trapping is the method of choice
for detection and identiﬁcation of free radical generation due
to its speciﬁcity and sensitivity. All ESR measurements were
conducted using a Bruker EMX spectrometer (Bruker Instru-
ments Inc., Billerica, MA 01821, USA) and a ﬂat cell assembly.
Hyperﬁne couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from
magnetic ﬁeld separation using potassium tetraperoxochro-
mate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as
reference standards (Janzen and Blackburn, 1968; Buettner,
1987). The relative radical concentration was estimated by
multiplying half of the peak height by (Hpp)2, where Hpp
represents peak-to-peak width. The Acquisit program was used
for data acquisitions and analyses (Bruker Instruments Inc.,
Billerica).
2.5. Scanning electron microscopy
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the ﬁlters were
trimmed into pie-shaped sections and mounted onto aluminum
stubs with double-stick carbon tape. The samples were then
coated with gold/palladium and viewed on a JEOL 6400 scan-
ning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at 20 kV. Elemental
analysis of particles was done using a Princeton Gamma-Tech
IMIX system (Princeton, NJ, USA).
2.6. H2O2 measurements
H2O2 production was monitored using a Bioxytech
quantitative hydrogen peroxide assay kit (H2O2-560, Oxis
International Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Measurements were
made on a system containing 5 × 106 RAW 264.7 mouse
peritoneal monocytes per millilitre in pH 7.4 PBS and expos-
ing them to the size groupings (refer to ﬁlter methods) of
wildﬁre smoke solution. Cells were exposed to wildland ﬁre
smoke solution [100 g/ml] for 30 min in a 37 ◦C incubator.
Absorbance was monitored at a wavelength of 560 nm using a
Spectra Max 250 multi-well plate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
2.7. Lipid peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation of RAW 264.7 mouse peritoneal
monocytes was measured by using a colormetric assay for mal-
ondialdehyde (LPO-586 Oxis International Inc., Portland). A
reaction mixture contained various size groups (refer to ﬁl-
ter methods) of wildﬁre smoke samples [100 g/ml], H2O2
(1 mM) and 1 × 107 cells in a total volume of 1.0 ml PBS (pH
7.4). A Fenton reaction, FeSO4 (1 mM), H2O2 (1 mM) and
1 × 107 cells, was also carried out as a positive control. The
mixtures were exposed for 1 h in a shaking water bath at 37 ◦C.
The measurement of lipid peroxidation is based on the reac-
tion of a chromogenic reagent with malonaldehyde at 45 ◦C
(Brambilla et al., 1989). The absorbance of the supernate was
measured at 586 nm.
2.8. DNA damage
The DNA strand break assay was carried out according to
methods described earlier (Daniel et al., 1993). Brieﬂy, reac-
tions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in
1.5 ml polypropylene tubes at 37 ◦C. A positive control reaction
between FeSO4 and H2O2 was used to generate hydroxyl radi-
cals. A reaction mixture contained various size groups (refer to
ﬁlter methods) of wildﬁre smoke samples [100 g/ml], 10 g
DNA ( Hind III fragments) and H2O2 (1 mM). This solution
was allowed to react for 30 min at 37 ◦C in a shaking water
bath. To this solution, 2 l of gel loading buffer (50 mM EDTA,
2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1% bromophenol blue)
was added, and then electrophoresis was performed in 0.7%
agarose at 1–2 V/cm in 40 mM tris acetate buffer containing
2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Gels were stained in vistra green nucleic
acid stain (5 l/ml) for 30 min and photographed under UV
light using a Stratagene Eagle Eye II (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla,
CA 92037, USA).
2.9. Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
(S.E.M.) (n = 3) for each group. One-way ANOVA test was
performed using SigmaStat statistical software (Jandel Scien-
tiﬁc, San Rafael, CA, USA) to compare the responses between
treatments. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Particle size distribution
Table 1 shows the mass-based distribution of particle
sizes collected by the 12 MOUDI samplers. The wild-
land ﬁre smoke shows a bell-shaped distribution with the
highest %masses, 14.5, 11.3 and 13 being found on ﬁlters
4, 5 and 6, respectively. These sizes range from a mean
of 4.2–1.34 m. The ultraﬁne (ﬁlters 9, 10, 11 and 12)
particles have the lowest overall mass, making up 20.2%

and 8) particles have the highest overall mass (43.8%)
of the overall mass collected. Our toxicological studies
showed that the ultraﬁne particle generated the highest
amount of ROS associated damage in assays preformed.
The complete %distribution can be seen in Table 1.
3.2. Stable free radicals
Fig. 1 shows a typical ESR spectrum recorded from
a wildland smoke ﬁlter sample. The spectrum shape and
magnetic ﬁeld location were assigned to carbon-centered
radicals (R•). Carbon-centered radials are relatively sta-
ble free radicals which, depending on environmental
conditions, can have a half-life of up to several days.
The carbon radical spectra were not observed in the
Fig. 1. A typical ESR spectrum of the carbon radical recorded from a
dry ﬁlter measurement. No change in spectral intensity was observed
over a 3-day period. ESR settings were center ﬁeld, 3490 G; scan width,
100 G; time constant, 0.40 s; modulation amplitude, 1 G; receiver gain,
6.32 × 104; frequency, 9.828 GHz; power, 100 mW.
aqueous samples with DMPO added. Control PVC ﬁl-
ters were tested and showed no radical formation. The
spectra strength was found to vary with particle size and
composition as reported in Figs. 3 and 4.
3.3. Radicals generated from H2O2 reaction
Fig. 2 shows an example of the spectra generated
from wildland ﬁre smoke exposed ﬁlters when treated
with H2O2, to create a Fenton-like reaction, in the pres-
ence of the radical spin trap DMPO. Filters were treated
in order to measure their potential to generate reac-
tive radical species when inhaled. The spectrum shown
in Fig. 2 demonstrates the 1:2:2:1 quartet splitting of
aN = aH = 14.9 as indicated by the magnetic ﬁeld legend.
Using these splitting constants, this 1:2:2:1 quartet can
be assigned to the DMPO/•OH adduct, showing •OH
radical generation. To further verify the involvement of
transition metals in the formation of the •OH radical,
a chelator, deferoxamine, was added at various con-
centrations. Concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mM
deferoxamine showed decreasing •OH peaks as the con-
centration of the chelator increased (data not shown).
3.4. Radical characteristics
Fig. 3 displays the relationship between radical peak
height per unit milligram and aerodynamic diameter of
the particles. The results show that the carbon radical was
stronger in the larger particles per unit mass, while the
•OH radical was stronger per unit mass in the smaller
particles. This could indicate that the larger particles

were produced at a lower temperature and generated
particles with less complete combustion in which the
carbon radicals stayed intact. The smaller particles may
have been produced at higher temperatures and lower
oxygen states, which may have dissipated the carbon
radical by forming cross-links and produced more poten-
tially reactive hydroxyl radical precursors (Halliwell and
Gutteridge, 2000a).
Fig. 4 demonstrates the relationship between radi-
cal peak height per unit particle surface area (m2) and
median aerodynamic diameter of each particle size frac-
tion. The surface area relationship was based on the
assumption that all particles were spherical in shape with
unit density. The results indicate that the ESR peaks are
surface area-dependent for the ultraﬁne and ﬁne sizes,
Fig. 4. Free radical activity per unit particle surface area. Both •OH
and carbon radicals showed good surface area correlation for ultraﬁne
and ﬁne sizes however, underestimation of true particle surface area or
particle bounce may have inﬂuenced the coarse particle results.

i.e., over these particle sizes, equivalent surface area pro-
duced equivalent radicals. The coarse particles departure
from this correlation may be partly due to an under-
estimate of the coarse particle surface area (i.e., true
particle shape may provide substantially larger surface
area than calculated from the assumption of spherical
particle shape), or party due to particle bounce of large
particles, an artifact of the required long sampling time.
3.5. Electron microscopy
Figs. 5 and 6 show representative samples from two
of the ﬁlter sizes. Fig. 5 shows the ﬁrst, and largest
particle size, ﬁlter stage (24 m) and a typical particle
elemental proﬁle and electron micrograph. The elemen-
tal proﬁle shows high amounts of both silica (Si) and

on sixth ﬁlter stage (median particle diameter 1.34 m). Smaller parti-
cles show a different proﬁle than the larger fraction containing carbon,
which could be the result of combustion. The clumping of the smaller
particles can also be observed.

iron (Fe), these reactive elements may have been part of
the combusted wood ﬁber or taken up from soil during
the burning process. Both Si and Fe have been shown
to be capable of reactive oxygen species generation. Si
acts through the splitting of Si O bonds generating •Si
and Si O• radicals on the fracture surfaces (Castranova
et al., 1995). Fe generates ROS through its transition
metal characteristics and the Fenton reaction with H2O2
(Halliwell and Gutteridge, 2000b). Fig. 6 shows ﬁlter
stage (1.34 m); the elemental proﬁle for these smaller
particles shows no measurable Si or Fe. It can also be
noted that while the particles are small, they show clump-
ing which may further affect their surface area related
characteristics.
3.6. H2O2
It has been shown in the previous section that H2O2
was involved in the •OH radical generation from wildﬁre
smoke particles via Fenton-like reaction. H2O2 genera-
tion was measured from RAW 264.7 cells exposed to
wildﬁre smoke suspended in PBS. As shown in Fig. 7,
this mixture generated H2O2 as determined by an assay,
which measures the oxidation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) to
ferricions(Fe3+)byhydrogenperoxideunderacidiccon-
ditions. Exposure of cells to wildﬁre smoke resulted in
a signiﬁcant increase in H2O2 production in the ultra-

was not signiﬁcantly different from the control in cellu-
lar H2O2 production. Therefore, on an equivalent mass
basis, small particles were more potent stimulants of
H2O2 production by monocytes than large particles.

(MDA) after exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to wildﬁre
smoke suspensions. The results show that the ultra-
ﬁne (0.042–0.24 m) and the ﬁne (0.42–2.4 m) sized
groups induced a signiﬁcant increase in MDA, from lipid
peroxidation, compared to the clean ﬁlter groups. The
coarse (4.2–24 m) sized group showed a small increase
in lipid peroxidation over the clean ﬁlter group, which
was not signiﬁcant.

results suggest generation of radicals from the reaction
of the wildﬁre smoke suspension with H2O2 and the
resulting DNA damage. Sodium formate, an •OH radical
scavenger, and deferoxamine, a metal chelator, inhib-
ited DNA damage caused by wildﬁre smoke plus H2O2,
demonstrating that a transition metal reaction with the
H2O2 was involved in the •OH generated DNA damage
(data not shown).
4. Discussion
The present study was undertaken to investigate pos-
sible radical generation in wildﬁre smoke particles and
to determine if their effects were size and surface area-
dependent. Our results determined that wildﬁre smoke
contains both carbon radicals and precursors, which are
able to react and generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from
a Fenton-like reaction with H2O2 as well as ROS gen-
eration after exposure to cells. Electron spin resonance
(ESR) analysis showed that carbon radicals were found
in all ﬁlter samples; however, a higher concentration per
milligram was found in the coarse (4.2–24 m) parti-
cles leading us to believe that the larger particles were
made up mostly of ash, not fully combusted wood parti-
cles, and some soil particles swept up during the process
of burning. The decreasing amount of carbon radicals
measured in the ﬁne (0.42–2.4 m) and the ultraﬁne
(0.042–0.24 m) sizes demonstrate that these groups
were made up of particles further along in the pyrolysis
process and due to oxygen depletion as well as tempera-
turethecarbonradicalshadcross-linkedtoformcovalent
bonds (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 2000b). Carbon radi-
cals are relatively stable and unlikely to do much damage
in biological systems (Jankovic et al., 1993). ESR was
also used to determine the •OH generating potential of
the particles. All wildﬁre ﬁlter sizes showed genera-
tion of •OH upon reaction with H2O2. Hydroxyl radical
generation was decreased when deferoxamine, a metal
chelator, was added to the reaction, indicating that a tran-
sition metal or metals were at least partly responsible
for the •OH generation (Halliwell, 1989). The reaction
with H2O2 was signiﬁcant because inhaled particles are
likelytoundergophagocytosisoncedepositedinthelung
(Patierno and Landolph, 1989). In this process, alveo-
lar macrophages and other cellular constituents generate
H2O2 as part of the respiratory burst (Halliwell and
Gutteridge, 2000c; Forman and Torres, 2002; Liu et al.,
1997). The H2O2 generated in response to the inhaled
particles can react with transition metals and other pre-
cursors present in the smoke, which by a Fenton-like
reaction can generate •OH (Halliwell and Gutteridge,
2000a).
Table 1 showed the distribution of particle mass-
based size. This distribution shows that the equivalency
of mass among the three groups: ultraﬁne (20.2%), ﬁne
(43.8%) and coarse (36.1%) was good and would be a
good model as to the bioavailability in humans. The three
basic size groups of the particles tested deposit into dif-
ferent regions of the lung. Coarse particles are mostly
deposited in the nasal area with some penetrating into
the conducting airways. Fine particles are deposited in
all three regions, but the majority are found in alveolar
region of the lung. Ultraﬁne particles penetrate into the
conducting tracheo-bronchial zone, deep into the pul-
monary zones and alveoli, where they can gain access
to the pulmonary interstitium (Castranova et al., 1991;
Pietropaoli et al., 2004; Chalupa et al., 2004).
Our results indicated that there were more ROS per
milligram in the smaller particles. Speciﬁcally, ultraﬁne
particles showed the highest production per unit mil-
ligram, which is of interest because these same particles
are able to penetrate deep into the pulmonary system and
into the alveolar region. This increase in radical produc-
tion corresponds to the greater surface area exposed to
allow reaction with the H2O2. In an organism, this same
increase in surface area would allow greater interaction
with macrophages and other defense systems, many of
which would react with the particle contents and gener-
ate ROS. Measurement of radicals showed surface area
dependence in the ultraﬁne and ﬁne sizes; however, the
coarse particles demonstrated a possible experimental

111
artifact that could be related either to the assumption
that particle surface area was equivalent to that of round
smooth spheres, or to particle bounce due to the long
sampling time. By the same token (similar to the col-
lection of coarse particles on the lower stage as a result
of particle bounce), the dry tar-like ﬁne particles could
be collected on the higher stage of the impactor as well.
The SEM micrographs indicate that depending on the
humidity of the environment, tar-like ﬁne particles could
coagulate into aggregate particles while still in the air-
borne state. As a result, these aggregate particles would
be collected on the higher stages of the impactor and con-
sidered as coarse particles. As a result, this phenomenon
also promotes the higher ratio for the coarse particles as
indicated in our results.
The results indicate that wildﬁre smoke is heteroge-
neousandcomplex.Particlesurfaceareamaybeacritical
factor in radical production characteristics of wildﬁre
smoke.
On an equivalent mass basis, the ultraﬁne and ﬁne
sizes also showed signiﬁcant increase in H2O2 genera-
tion from RAW cells, which indicate that these particles
are more reactive, generate a stronger respiratory burst
in cells, and therefore, may have more •OH generation
potential. The strong respiratory burst acts synergisti-
cally with the surface area and chemical composition of
the particles to provide more reactive surfaces. The ultra-
ﬁne and ﬁne particles also showed a signiﬁcant increase
in lipid peroxidation in exposed RAW cells again indi-
cating their potential for damage to cells and organisms.
Lipid peroxidation results in a release of lipid-derived
radicals (R•, RO• and ROO•) (Shi et al., 1988) These
radicalscanhaveacascadeeffectandleadtofurtherreac-
tionsinthecellmembraneandreleasecatalyticallyactive
iron (Vladimirov, 1986), which will further increase the
generation of ROS. Lipid peroxidation and its products
have been found to cause DNA damage (Vaca et al.,
1988) and may function as tumor initiators (Comporti,
1985).
The signiﬁcant increase seen in H2O2 production and
lipid peroxidation by exposure of cells to both ultraﬁne
and ﬁne wildﬁre smoke suspensions correlates well with
the results measured from •OH generation by these same
particles.
The data further demonstrate that the •OH radicals
generated from the reaction between the wildﬁre smoke
and H2O2 caused DNA strand breaks. All size groups
were observed to cause DNA damage with no signif-
icant difference seen between them. It should be noted
that •OH radicals generated in the reaction of H2O2 with
certain metal ions, such as nickel (Inoue and Kawanishi,
1989), copper or zinc containing SOD (Yim et al., 1990),
exhibit very little reactivity. For example, the •OH radi-
cals produced by these systems cannot be scavenged by
ethanol or formate. The reason for this non-reactivity is
believed to be that •OH radicals are generated within
the domain of certain macromolecules, and hence are
not “free” to exhibit signiﬁcant reactivity (Inoue and
Kawanishi, 1989; Yim et al., 1990). However, the results
obtained from the present study show that •OH radi-
cals generated from materials found in wildﬁre smoke
have the potential to cause DNA damage. Furthermore,
H2O2, and •OH may cause other cellular damage via
mechanism typically associated with reactions initiated
by reactive oxygen species, for example, dG hydroxyla-
tion and protein–DNA cross-links. They may also cause
activation of nuclear transcription factors, such as NF-
B, over-expression of certain oncogenes and induction
of p53 mutation (Chen et al., 2000; Shi et al., 1998).
In conclusion, the results of the present study
demonstrate that wildﬁre smoke particles have differ-
ent chemical characteristics over different size-ranges
and can generate ROS, which are affected by both sur-
faceareaandthesedifferentcharacteristics.Theparticles
can cause cellular respiratory burst, increased generation
of radical precursors, such as H2O2 and can also cause
lipid peroxidation. These same radicals are also respon-
sible for DNA damage. The most reactive particles were
observed to be the ultraﬁne group, which can penetrate
furthest into the lung of an exposed ﬁreﬁghter. Future
studies involving the in vivo exposure of wildﬁre smoke
are planned to further study the impact the free radical
formation can have in lipid peroxidation and DNA dam-
age. Therefore, our results suggest that wildﬁre smoke
may cause acute lung injury. Since particle size and sur-
face area of the smoke exposure are signiﬁcant factors
in radical generation and particle deposition, particle
size should be considered when developing protective
strategies.
