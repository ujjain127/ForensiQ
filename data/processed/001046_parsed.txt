Generic SSLs
APPENDIX A
Generic SSLs
Table A-1 provides generic SSLs for 110 chemicals. Generic SSLs are derived using default values in the
standardized equations presented in Part 2 of this document. The default values (listed in Table A-2)
are conservative and are likely to be protective for the majority of site conditions across the nation. 
However, the generic SSLs are not necessarily protective of all known human exposure pathways,
reasonable land uses, or ecological threats. Thus, before applying generic SSLs at a site, it is extremely
important to compare the conceptual site model (see the User’s Guide) with the assumptions behind
the SSLs to ensure that the site conditions and exposure pathways match those used to develop generic
SSLs (see Parts 1 and 2 and Table A-2). If this comparison indicates that the site is more complex
than the SSL scenario, or that there are significant exposure pathways not accounted for by the SSLs,
then generic SSLs are not sufficient for a full evaluation of the site. A more detailed site-specific
approach will be necessary to evaluate the additional pathways or site conditions.   
Generic SSLs are presented separately for major pathways of concern in both surface and subsurface
soils.  The first column to the right of the chemical name presents levels based on direct ingestion of
soil and the second column presents levels based on inhalation. As discussed in the User’s Guide, the
fugitive dust pathway may be of concern for certain metals but does not appear to be of concern for
organic compounds. Therefore, SSLs for the fugitive dust pathway are only presented for inorganic
compounds. Except for mercury, no SSLs for the inhalation of volatiles pathway are provided for
inorganic compounds because these chemicals are not volatile.  
The user should note that several of the generic SSLs for the inhalation of volatiles pathway are
determined by the soil saturation concentration (Csat), which is used to address and screen the potential
presence of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs).  As explained in Section 2.4.4, for compounds that are
liquid at ambient soil temperature, concentrations above Csat indicate a potential for free-phase liquid
contamination to be present and the need for additional investigation.
The third column presents generic SSL values for the migration to ground water pathway developed
using a default DAF (dilution-attenuation factor) of 20 to account for natural processes that reduce
contaminant concentrations in the subsurface (see Section 2.5.6). SSLs in Table A-1 are rounded to
two significant figures except for values less than 10, which are rounded to one significant figure. Note
that the 20 DAF values in Table A-1 are not exactly 20 times the 1 DAF values because each SSL is
calculated independently in both the 20 DAF and 1 DAF columns, with the final value presented
according to the aforementioned rounding conventions. 
The fourth column contains the generic SSLs for the migration to ground water pathway developed
assuming no dilution or attenuation between the source and the receptor well (i.e., a DAF of 1). These
values can be used at sites where little or no dilution or attenuation of soil leachate concentrations is
expected at a site (e.g., sites with shallow water tables, fractured media, karst topography, or source
size greater than 30 acres).  
Generally, if an SSL is not exceeded for a pathway of concern, the user may eliminate the pathway or
areas of the site from further investigation. If more than one exposure pathway is of concern, the
lowest SSL should be used.

Analysis of Effects of Source Size on Generic SSLs
A large number of commenters on the December 1994 Soil Screening Guidance suggested that most
contaminated soil sources were 0.5 acre or less. Before changing this default assumption from 30 acres
to 0.5 acre, the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (OERR) conducted an analysis of the
effects of changing the area of a contaminated soil source on generic SSLs calculated for the inhalation
and migration to ground water exposure pathways. This analysis includes:
•
An analysis of the sensitivity of SSLs to a change in source area from 30 acres to 0.5
acre
•
Mass-limit modeling results showing the depth of contamination for a 30-acre source
that corresponds to a 0.5-acre SSL.
All equations, assumptions, and model input parameters used in this analysis are consistent with those
described in Part 2 of this document unless otherwise indicated. Chemical properties used in the
analysis are described in Part 5 of this document.
In summary, the results of this analysis indicate that:
•
The SSLs are not particularly sensitive to varying the source area from 30 acres to 0.5
acre. This reduction in source area lowers SSLs for the inhalation pathway by about a
factor of 2 and lowers SSLs for the migration to ground water pathway by a factor of
2.9 under typical hydrogeologic conditions.
•
Half-acre SSLs calculated for 43 volatile and semivolatile contaminants using the
infinite source models correspond to mass-limit SSLs for a 30-acre source uniformly
contaminated to a depth of about 1 to 21 meters (depending on contaminant and
pathway); the average depth is 8 meters for the inhalation pathway (21 contaminants)
and 11 meters for the migration to ground water pathway (43 contaminants).
Sensitivity 
Analysis. For the inhalation pathway, source area affects the Q/C value (a measure
of dispersion), which directly affects the final SSL and is not chemical-specific. Higher Q/C values
result in higher SSLs. As shown in Table 3 (Section 2.4.3), the effect of area on the Q/C value is not
sensitive to meteorological conditions, with the ratio of a 0.5-acre Q/C to a 30-acre Q/C ranging from
1.93 to 1.96 over the 29 conditions analyzed. Decreasing the source area from 30 acres to 0.5 acre
will therefore increase inhalation SSLs by about a factor of 2.
For the migration to ground water pathway, source area affects the DAF, which also directly affects
the final SSLs and is not chemical-specific. The sensitivity analysis for the dilution factor is more
complicated than for Q/C because increasing source area (expressed as the length of source parallel to
ground water flow) not only increases infiltration to the aquifer, which decreases the dilution factor,
but also increases the mixing zone depth, which tends to increase the dilution factor. The first effect
generally overrides the second (i.e., longer sources have lower dilution factors) except for very thick
aquifers (see Section 2.5.7). 
The sensitivity analysis described in Section 2.5.7 shows that the dilution model is most sensitive to
the aquifer's Darcy velocity (i.e., hydraulic conductivity H hydraulic gradient). For a less conservative
Darcy velocity (90th percentile), decreasing the source area from 30 acres to 0.5 acre increased the
dilution factor by a factor of 3.1 (see Table 9, Section 2.5.7). For the conditions analyzed, decreasing
the source area from 30 acres to 0.5 acre affected dilution factor from no increase to a factor of 4.3
increase. No increase in dilution factor for a 0.5-acre source was observed for the less conservative
A-7
(higher) aquifer thickness (46 m). In this case the decrease in mixing zone depth balances the decrease
in infiltration rate for the smaller source. 
Mass-Limit 
Analysis. The infinite source assumption is one of the more conservative
assumptions inherent in the SSL models, especially for small sources. This assumption should provide
adequate protection for sources with larger areas than those used to calculate SSLs. To test this
hypothesis the SSL mass-limit models (Section 2.6) were used to calculate, for 43 volatile and
semivolatile chemicals, the depth at which a mass-limit SSL for a 30-acre source is equal to a 0.5-acre
infinite-source SSL. 
The mass-limit models are simple mass-balance models that calculate SSLs based on the conservative
assumption that the entire mass of contamination in a source either volatilizes (inhalation model) or
leaches (migration to ground water model) over the exposure period of interest. These models were
developed to correct the mass-balance violation in the infinite source models for highly volatile or
soluble contaminants.
Table A-3 presents the results of this analysis. These results demonstrate that 0.5-acre infinite source
SSLs are protective of uniformly contaminated 30-acre source areas of significant depth. For the 21
chemicals analyzed for the inhalation pathway, these source depths range up to 21 meters, with an
average depth of 8 meters and a standard deviation of 5.7. For the migration to ground water pathway,
source depths for 43 contaminants range to 21 meters, with an average of 11 meters and a standard
deviation of 5.4.
