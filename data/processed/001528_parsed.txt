INTRODUCTION
The Moving-Bed Copper Oxide Process is a dry, regenerable sorbent technique that uses supported
copper oxide sorbent to simultaneously remove SO2 and NOX emissions from flue gas generated by coal
combustion. This process can meet the goals of a Department of Energy (DOE) initiative to develop flue
gas control technologies to remove 99% and 95% of SO2 and NOX, respectively, at a low cost for
emission control. The process can be integrated into the design of advanced power systems, such as the
Low-Emission Boiler System (LEBS) or the High-Performance Power System (HIPPS) [1]. This flue gas
cleanup technique is currently being evaluated in a life-cycle test system (LCTS) with a moving-bed flue
gas contactor at DOE's Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. An experimental data base being
established will be used to verify reported technical and economic advantages, optimize process
conditions, provide scaleup information, and validate absorber and regenerator mathematical models.
The chemistry of the process is relatively straightforward. In the absorption step, SO2 in the flue gas
reacts with copper oxide, supported on small spheres of alumina, to form copper sulfate. Ammonia is
injected into the flue gas before the absorption reactor and a selective catalytic reduction-type reaction
occurs that reduces the nitric oxides in the flue gas. In the regeneration step, the copper sulfate is
reduced in a regenerator with a reducing agent, such as natural gas, producing a concentrated stream of
SO2. Another advantage of the process is that the low pressure drop across the moving-bed
configuration reduces power consumption and thus influences the overall economic costs. The
moving-bed process also has a lower projected sorbent attrition rate compared with other reactor
configurations. Lastly, high sorbent utilization (the degree to which the sorbent absorbs its theoretical
maximum level of SO2 based on the metal oxide loading on the alumina sphere) can be realized in a
moving-bed design.
In this communication, the results from several process parametric test series with the LCTS are
discussed. The effects of various absorber and regenerator parameters on sorbent performance (e.g., SO2
removal) were investigated. Sorbent spheres of 1/8-in diameter were used as compared to 1/16-in sized
sorbent of a previous study [2]. Also discussed are modifications to the absorber to improve the
operability of the LCTS when fly ash is present during coal combustion. 
EXPERIMENTAL
The process has been investigated using the LCTS, which has been diagramed and described previously
[3]. The LCTS has the capability of operating in a continuous integrated mode, specifically related to the
absorption and regeneration steps. The sorbent performance in the moving-bed configuration has been
characterized by using flue gas that can be produced by combusting natural gas or by combusting
pulverized coal (34 lb/hr of an Illinois Old Ben Mine No. 24) with some natural gas support, resulting in
a nominal flue gas flow rate of 110 scfm. The flue gas is spiked with SO2 and NO supplied from cylinders
to adjust these concentrations to those of the desired test levels. Ammonia is injected into the flue gas
upstream of the absorber to facilitate the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water
vapor in the absorber. The sorbent process stream in the LCTS involves a closed-loop cycle of sorbent
transported through four major vessels: the moving-bed absorber, a fluidized-bed sorbent heater, the
regenerator, and a fluidized-bed air cooler. Sorbent hoppers located between the vessels isolate the
activities occurring in each vessel and provide for metered transport of the sorbent around the
closed-loop cycle.
An earlier study with the LCTS entailed using a 1/16-in diameter sphere of copper oxide/alumina sorbent
[2]. However, recent economic and industrial considerations related to bed pressure drop and sorbent
transport have guided the scope of the study to include a larger-sized sorbent. Unless noted, the results in
this communication allude to those obtained while using 1/8-in diameter sorbent spheres that were
produced by Alcoa and contain a copper loading of about 6.6 weight percent. The sorbent was
formulated by an incipient wetness technique using a solution of copper sulfate as the impregnant. Initial
activation of the sorbent was conducted in the regenerator, either in a batch or continuous mode.
Modifications to the LCTS were required to effectively transport, heat, and cool the larger and denser
Alcoa sorbent. The major changes consisted of inserting a sleeve into the fluidized-bed cooler and the
fluidized-bed heater to reduce the effective cross-sectional area at the available fluidizing gas supply,
since the fluidization velocity of the larger 1/8-in sorbent was much greater than that of the 1/16-in
sorbent used in the past.
Also, operational difficulties while burning coal in the LCTS needed to be eliminated. If the original
absorber design was used during coal burning, sorbent performance in the absorber would degrade as fly
ash accumulated within the bed and/or on the sorbent retention screens. Removal of SO2 in the absorber
typically decreased while pressure drop through the absorber increased. Two modifications were made to
the absorber to negate this problem: a new design of the sorbent retention screens and an increase in the
pulsing capability of the absorber. The initial design of the sorbent retention screen (an inlet and outlet
screen envelop the moving-bed of sorbent in the absorber) incorporated a square, stainless steel wire
mesh (35 mesh -- 0.0176-in square opening by 0.011-in wire diameter) affixed by tack-welding to a
stainless steel perforated plate (0.125-in thick, 1-in diameter holes on a hexagonal pattern with 1.25-in
center-to-center spacing). However, due to the aforementioned ash plugging problem, a new retention
screen design using vertical bars fabricated by Hendrick Manufacturing Company was conceived. The
new retention screen consists of stainless steel vertical bars spaced slightly apart, resulting in vertical slots
that retain particles of a certain diameter. The cross-sectional area of each bar is shaped like a truncated
"golf tee" so that any particle able to penetrate the minimum slot opening encounters a diverging nozzle
arrangement, and thus the particle is free to migrate through the rear of the screen. At the sorbent/screen
interface, the bar measures 0.140-in width and spaced 0.030-in apart (i.e., the minimum slot opening) so
that particles less than 0.030 inches slip through the minimum slot opening. 
A design change to the back-pulser assembly was also incorporated. The original assembly consisted of
eight chambers segmenting the cross-sectional area of the rear retention screen. Each chamber provided
screen coverage of 6-in bed width by 4-ft bed height. Two horizontal rows, each containing 4 chambers,
provided total screen coverage of 2-ft bed width by 8-ft bed height. Each chamber contained one venturi
nozzle to deliver the back-pulse. In an effort to minimize any flow disruption to the furnace, the
chambers were sequenced to pulse such that only a quarter of the total bed area was back-pulsed at one
time. An increase in back-pulsing capability was implemented by doubling the number of venturi in each
chamber from one to two. Also, better sealing of the chamber to the rear screen was incorporated.
DISCUSSION AND RESULTS
Sorbent performance and operational performance of the LCTS are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for
absorption and regeneration parametric studies, respectively. A similar study was conducted with a
1/16-in diameter sorbent using spiked flue gas from natural gas combustion [2]. However, in the present
study, some testing periods were conducted to confirm an adequate performance with the larger sorbent
and to validate the design of the modified absorber while burning coal. The absorber bed had dimensions
of 8-ft height, 1-ft width, and 5-in depth throughout the testing. Periodically during the parametric
testing, a baseline condition was repeated to assure that the activity of the sorbent, as well as the
operational response of the LCTS, was maintained. The parameters and calculated quantities in the tables
represent the average of the data or calculation over a designated steady-state period. Nitric oxide was
injected after certain test period conditions attained steady-state, followed by ammonia injection to reach
a desired level of NOX removal. During coal combustion, spiking with NO was not necessary. 
During the absorption study, the regeneration parameters were typically held at 850oF, a residence time
of 180 min, and a natural gas-to-sulfur molar ratio of at least 1. The effects of inlet SO2 concentration
and sorbent flow on the pollutant removal efficiencies in the absorber were systematically investigated. A
temperature scan was not conducted since past investigations with copper oxide indicated the optimum
temperature of absorption is near 750oF. Absorber model predictions were also compared to the actual
SO2 removals at a set of conditions. Modifications to the previous modeling effort [4] included a factor
for pore diffusional effects with the larger sorbent [5]. The SO2 removal of the baseline test was 85
percent. 
The impact of the inlet flue gas SO2 concentration was investigated. Essentially, as the SO2
concentration increases, the effective Cu/S feed ratio decreases, thus causing a decrease in SO2 removal
efficiency. Results can be seen in Table 1 when periods A, B, and G are compared at the lower sorbent
flow rate of 0.75 lb/min, and when periods E and F are compared at the sorbent flow rate of 1.5 lb/min.
The concentration levels of SO2 were nominally 1500, 2250, and 3250 ppm on a dry basis and simulate
the concentrations in flue gas when a mid- to high-sulfur coal is combusted.

The effect of changing the sorbent flow on the SO2 removal efficiency was also investigated. Effects of
varying the sorbent flow can be seen at two different inlet gas SO2 concentration conditions. The first is
at a nominal 2250 ppm inlet concentration for periods B, C, and E; SO2 removals increased with
increasing sorbent flow. The second is at a nominal 3000 ppm inlet SO2 concentration for periods G and
F. The trend is the same indicating that a higher sorbent flow of regenerated sorbent will enhance the
SO2 removal efficiency of the absorber.
Several additional items should also be noted with respect to these absorption tests. A return to the
baseline conditions after a duration of time (periods B and H) indicated that no decrease in sorbent
activity occurred during the testing. Also, the reactivity of the sorbent was not impacted when flue gas
produced by coal combustion was substituted for that produced by natural gas combustion (periods C
and D). The revised sulfation model predicted the SO2 removals quite well as seen in Table 1. Also, NOX
removals were around the designed levels of 90% and 95% as seen in Table 1. 
A regeneration study listed in Table 2 investigated the effects of temperature, residence time, and natural
gas-to-sulfur molar ratio on regeneration. Constant nominal absorption conditions of 110 scfm of flue
gas, 750oF, 0.75 lb/min sorbent flow, and 2250 ppm inlet SO2 concentration were maintained. The effect
of temperature can be seen in periods I and L where a 50Fo drop in temperature decreases the
effectiveness of regeneration, as depicted in the larger concentration of methane in the off-gas and a
decrease in absorber SO2 removal. The impact of sorbent residence time was studied at constant natural
gas-to-sulfur ratio and temperature in periods J, K, and M. Although the results appear similar at
residence times of 180 min and 120 min, the effectiveness of regeneration diminishes below a residence
time of 120 min as determined by an increase in regenerator outlet CH4 concentration and a decrease in
SO2 removal in the absorber. The influence of natural gas-to-sulfur molar ratios can be determined by
comparing periods I and J, where the larger ratio condition resulted in the outlet gas diluted with
methane. At these two particular ratios, the impact on the overall capacity of the sorbent for SO2
removal was minimal.

Table 3 reports the findings of the absorber modification changes with two different sorbent sizes. For all
the test periods reported, flue gas flow was obtained from natural gas firing of the combustor. The total
pressure drop across the bed was the largest with the old retention screen design (2.5 in of water) as
compared to the new design (1.4 in of water). The screen substitution did not impact the SO2 removal
but did successfully lower the pressure drop across the absorber. A benefit in going to the larger-sized
sorbent can be observed by the decrease in pressure drop from 1.4 to 1.0 in of water. As seen by the SO2
removal, it is also noteworthy that the sorbent reactivity of the smaller sorbent was greater than the
larger material, indicating that pore diffusional resistance is greater for the larger sorbent. 
As stated before, the SO2 removal was not significantly impacted when flue gas produced from coal
firing was substituted for that produced from natural gas firing. (See Table 1 periods C and D and Table
2 periods I, N, and O.) Typically, an increase in absorber pressure drop was experienced due to fly ash
accumulation in the bed, but either continuous pulsing or a pulse after a certain pressure drop was
obtained (similar to a baghouse operation) would reduce the pressure drop. Most of the fly ash ends up
in the sorbent stream from the absorber and in the flue gas exit stream from the absorber. 
SUMMARY 
A parametric study of the Moving-Bed Copper Oxide Process was conducted with 1/8-in sorbent in the
LCTS. The effects of various parameters on the absorption and regeneration steps of this flue gas
cleanup technique were systematically investigated. High removals of SO2 were obtained at most
conditions. A decrease in the inlet SO2 concentration or an increase in the sorbent flow rate would
enhance the SO2 removal capabilities of the absorber.

Note: 
1) Identical flow in each case. 
2) Bed dimensions: 8 Ft(H) x 1 Ft(W) x 5 In(D). 
3) Similar absorber and regenerator conditions for all test periods.
Regarding regeneration, a high temperature or a large residence time has a major influence on the
regeneration of the sorbent. A new absorber design facilitates the use of particulate-laden flue gas in the
current bed configuration.
