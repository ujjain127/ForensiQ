 
What is a generic drug?
When a brand-name drug's patent protection expires, generic versions of the drug 
can be approved for sale. The generic version works like the brand-name drug in 
dosage, strength, performance and use, and must meet the same quality and safety 
standards. All generic drugs must be reviewed and approved by FDA.
How does FDA ensure that my generic drug is as 
safe and effective as the brand-name drug?
All generic drugs are put through a rigorous, multi-step review process that includes a review of scientific 
data on the generic drug's ingredients and performance. FDA also conducts periodic inspections of the 
manufacturing plant, and monitors drug quality—even after the generic drug has been approved. 
If generic drugs and brand-name drugs have the same active 
ingredients, why do they look different?
Generic drugs look different because certain inactive ingredients, such as colors 
and flavorings, may be different. These ingredients do not affect the performance, 
safety or effectiveness of the generic drug. They look different because trademark 
laws in the U.S. do not allow a generic drug to look exactly like other drugs 
already on the market. 
Is my generic drug made by the same company that makes
the brand-name drug?
It is possible. Brand-name firms are responsible for manufacturing approximately 50 percent of
generic drugs. 
Are generic drugs always made in the same kind of facilities
as brand-name drugs?
Yes. All generic drug manufacturing facilities must meet FDA’s standards of good manufacturing practices. 
FDA will not permit drugs to be made in substandard facilities. FDA conducts about 3,500 inspections a year 
to ensure standards are met.
FDA makes it tough to become a generic drug in America so you can feel confident about taking your 
generic drugs. If you still want to learn more, talk with your doctor, pharmacist or other health care 
professional or call 1-888-INFO-FDA.
