Current approach to validation of a release test 
indication for bacterial detection devices
• Obtain data on performance of the FDA cleared 
devices when used to meet the AABB bacterial 
detection standard 5.1.5.1 since 3/04
• Use data as a basis for approval of 7 day platelets 
provided there is a commitment to perform a post 
marketing study
• Post marketing study will consist of additional 
cultures on outdated products (day 7)  to confirm 
the day 1 negative culture readings 
• Goal is to demonstrate a point estimate of risk at 
day 7 to be 1/10,000 with a 95% upper confidence 
limit that the risk is <1/5,000
• Study size ~ 50,000 platelet units

Current post marketing study design 
outline
• First sample collected early in storage 
– Aerobic and anaerobic bottles
• Second sample collected at outdate 
after day 7
– Aerobic and anaerobic bottles

Analysis of post marketing data
• Determine residual risk of bacterial 
contamination for 7 day platelets tested early in 
storage by a bacterial detection device
• Acceptable risk for aerobic and anaerobic 
bacteria
– point estimate of risk at day 7 to be 1/10,000 with a 
95% upper confidence limit that the risk is <1/5,000
• Comparison of detection rates for aerobic and 
anaerobic bacteria in the aerobic and anaerobic 
bottles
• If aerobic detection method is capable of 
reducing the residual risk of anaerobic bacteria 
as defined above, then anaerobic method will 
not be required for release of platelets

Alternative post market studies for a release 
test indication of a bacterial detection device
• Sponsor may choose not to test the early 
storage sample by an anaerobic method 
(aerobic testing only) if test sensitivity is 
enhanced in other ways
• Due to the undefined risk of anaerobic 
bacteria this type of a study design will need 
to be performed under an IND if platelets are 
transfused after day 5 storage

Alternative post market studies for a release 
test indication of a bacterial detection device
• The final sample at storage out-date will need 
to be tested with both an aerobic and 
anaerobic method
• A finding of clinically significant anaerobes at 
outdate would require a change in the study 
protocol to culture for anaerobes early in 
storage
• Data from the study can be used to seek 
clearance of the device as a release test

Current estimate of risk from anaerobic bacteria 
contaminating platelet products
• True risk has not been defined 
• Published studies and reporting to the FDA 
indicate that the risk exists although it is 
small
• Three mortalities from transfusion 
transmitted anaerobic bacteria reported to 
the FDA
• 2000-
Clostridium p.  
red cells
• 2001-
Clostridium p.

• 2005-

Is Propionibacterium acnes contaminated 
blood a risk to transfusion recipients?
Jakab, E. et al. Severe infections caused by proprionibacterium acnes:
an underestimated pathogen in late postoperative infections 
Yale J. Biol. Med 1996, 69:477-82
• Frequent contaminant of blood
• Has been associated with clinical syndromes of 
endocarditis, post craniotomy infections, 
arthritis, spondylodiscitis, endophthalmitis, 
pansinusitis
• Predominant predisposing conditions were 
surgery preceding infection 2wks – 4 years and 
implantation of foreign bodies
• Can be a pathogen in certain patients
• May cause disease in some patients receiving 
contaminated blood

Summary of submission process for bacterial 
detection devices to release platelet products and 
extend platelet shelf life to 7 days.
• Define analytical sensitivity (spiking studies)
• Device cleared for Q/C use
– Collect Q/C data to determine true and false positive rate in 
clinical setting
• Use Q/C data to support submission of a release test indication
• Clearance of release test with commitment to do a post 
marketing study
• Current study design:  aerobic and anaerobic detection from 
early sampling confirmed with aerobic and anaerobic detection 
at outdate
• Alternate designs of post marketing studies will be considered 
but may need to be done under an IND
