Abstract.
Homeostatic maintenance of gas exchange optimizes carbon gain per water
loss. Homeostasis is regulated by short-term physiological and long-term structural
mechanisms, both of which may respond to changes in resource availability associated with
competition. Therefore, stand density regulation via silvicultural manipulations may facilitate
growth and survival through mechanisms operating at both short and long timescales. We
investigated the responses of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) to stand basal area
manipulations in Arizona, USA. Stand basal area was manipulated to seven replicated levels
in 1962 and was maintained for four decades by decadal thinning. We measured basal area
increment (BAI) to assess the response and sustainability of wood growth, carbon isotope
discrimination (D) inferred from annual rings to assess the response of crown gas exchange,
and ratios of leaf area to sapwood area (Al:As) to assess longer term structural acclimation.
Basal area treatments increased soil water potential (r2 ¼ 0.99) but did not affect
photosynthetic capacity. BAI increased within two years of thinning, and the 40-year mean
BAI was negatively correlated with stand basal area (r2 ¼ 0.98). D was negatively correlated
with stand basal area for years 5 through 12 after thinning (r2 ¼ 0.90). However, D was
relatively invariant with basal area for the period 13–40 years after initial thinning despite
maintenance of treatment basal areas via repeated decadal thinnings. Independent gas
exchange measurements veriﬁed that the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance was
invariant with basal area, but absolute values of both were elevated at lower basal areas. Al:As
was negatively correlated with basal area (r2 ¼ 0.93). We hypothesize that increased Al:As is a
homeostatic response to increased water availability that maximizes water-use efﬁciency and
whole-tree carbon uptake. Elevated Al:As of trees at low basal areas was associated with
greater resilience to climate, i.e., greater absolute BAI during drought; however, trees with
high Al:As in low basal area stands also exhibited the greatest sensitivity to drought, i.e.,
greater relative decline in BAI.

INTRODUCTION
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) is a widespread
conifer in North America, with a range extending from
southern Canada to central Mexico (Waring and Law
2001). This economically and ecologically valuable
species is experiencing drastic constraints on survival
and productivity in recent decades due largely to the
policy of ﬁre exclusion practiced since the late 1800s.
Prior to this period, ponderosa pine forests typically were
exposed to frequent surface ﬁres that removed competing
vegetation and maintained open, low-density stands
(Cooper 1960, Covington and Moore 1994a, Moore et
al. 1999, Swetnam et al. 1999). Fire exclusion has allowed
heavy seedling regeneration within pine forests, which
has increased density and competition among trees (Agee
1993). These changes increase the risk of wildﬁres (Fule´
et al. 2001, Allen et al. 2002, Pierce et al. 2004), bark
beetle attacks (Waring and Pitman 1985, Kolb et al.
1998) and decrease individual tree productivity (Parsons
and De Benedetti 1979, Biondi 1996). Scientists, land
managers, and the public are concerned that unless
intervention occurs, we may lose a large portion of North
America’s ponderosa pine forests.
Reducing stand density is an approach to restoring
ecosystem resilience and reducing wildﬁre risk (Coving-
ton et al. 1997, Allen et al. 2002), and may be applicable
as ecological restoration treatments to old-growth
forests (Covington and Moore 1994b, Mast et al. 1999)
or proactive application to younger forests (Skov et al.
2004). Although the ideal silvicultural prescriptions may
vary between regions and even sites (Morgan et al. 1994,
Fule´ et al. 1997, Landres et al. 1999, Moore et al. 2003,
Brown et al. 2004, Schoennagel et al. 2004), stand
density reductions are likely to reduce forest suscepti-
bility to disturbance and increase productivity of

remaining trees (Fiddler et al. 1989, Feeney et al. 1998,
Latham and Tappeiner 2002). Unfortunately, under-
standing of the physiological mechanisms underpinning
the long-term relationship between the reduction in
competition and the magnitude and sustainability of
productivity response is lacking. Over the short term, it
appears that increases in water availability are at least
partly responsible for increased growth after thinning in
semiarid forests where leaf area index (LAI) is low and
light is not a strongly limiting factor (Sucoff and Hong
1974, Donner and Running 1986, Warren et al. 2001,
McDowell et al. 2003). In such systems, increased water
availability may increase photosynthesis (Pn) via in-
creased stomatal conductance (g; Feeney et al. 1998,
Kolb et al. 1998, McDowell et al. 2003, Skov et al. 2004).
The duration of this physiological response over decadal
timescales may be inﬂuenced by the response of LAI to
reduced stand density via increased leaf area of the
understory vegetation (Oren et al. 1987) or of the
remaining trees; however, no longer-term investigation
has been conducted to test the latter explanation.
A theoretical basis for the long-term regulation of
productivity in response to stand basal area reductions
can be derived from an individual tree-based application
of the stand-level hydraulic model proposed by Jarvis
(1975) and reﬁned by Whitehead et al. (1984). This
theory is based on Darcy’s law and proposes that crown
exchange of CO2 and H2O is regulated by a set of
homeostatic relationships between structural and phys-
iological parameters including the ratio of transpiring
leaf area to sapwood area (Al:As) and the soil-to-leaf
water potential gradient (Ws–Wl):

This version of the original equation grossly over-
simplifies the hydraulic and metabolic system of trees;
however, it is appropriate for a stand of trees of uniform
age, in which we can expect that other factors such as
water viscosity and density (Matzner and Comstock
2001), tree height (Scha¨ fer et al. 2000), and xylem
specific conductivity (Pothier et al. 1989) are relatively
invariant. For more detailed versions of the model see
Whitehead (1998), Scha¨ fer et al. (2000), McDowell et al.
(2002a), Phillips et al. (2002), and others. Importantly,
Eq. 1 captures three critical parameters that may
respond to stand basal area reductions: (1) a driving
resource expected to change due to reduced stand-level
transpiration, Ws, (2) a structural response parameter,
Al:As, and (3) a physiological response parameter, g. As
can be seen in Eq. 1, increases in soil moisture content
(Ws) allow an increase in Al:As, g, or both.
Increasing Al:As is an expected result of increasing soil
moisture content because there is more water available
to support transpiring surface area (Al), and likewise the
importance of large As for water supply and capacitance
is reduced (Waring et al. 1979, Mencuccini and Grace
1995, Maherali and DeLucia 2001). One beneﬁt of
increasing Al:As is the increased leaf area that can
intercept light and conduct photosynthesis. Thus, even if
the absolute rates of photosynthesis per unit leaf area
remain unchanged after reductions in stand basal area,
increased Al:As should allow greater crown-scale Pn.
However, shifts in aboveground architecture presum-
ably take many years, even decades, to occur (Ishii and
McDowell 2002). Therefore, understanding mechanisms
regarding the long-term growth response of trees to
reductions in stand-level competition requires assess-
ment of Al:As from long-term studies.
Increased g results from increased soil moisture
because the greater supply of water enables increased
transpiration at reduced risk of xylem cavitation (Tyree
and Sperry 1988, Sperry et al. 1998). Increased g allows
increased Pn due to increased CO2 diffusion to the
mesophyll cells where photosynthesis occurs:
P ’ g 3ðca  ciÞ:
ð2Þ
In this representation of Fick’s law, ca and ci are
atmospheric and internal CO2 concentrations. Thus,
thinning may result in increased Pn per unit leaf area
(Kolb et al. 1998, McDowell et al. 2003).
We can retrospectively examine annual variation in
crown-scale gas exchange metabolism using the carbon
isotope ratio (d13C) of tree rings (Francey and Farquhar
1982, Walcroft et al. 1997). Photosynthesis by ponder-
osa pines discriminates against 13CO2 relative to 12CO2
because
13CO2 has a lower diffusivity through the
stomatal pore and lower reactivity with the photo-
synthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy-
lase-oxygenase (Rubisco). This discrimination (D)
results in d13C of the carbon within ponderosa pine tree
rings to be ;15–25ø below that of atmospheric CO2.
Discrimination can be expressed relative to ci/ca via the
following simpliﬁed expression (Farquhar et al. 1989):
D ’ a þ ðb  aÞ 3 ci
ca
ð3Þ
where a is the fractionation associated with diffusion in
air (4.4ø), b is the net fractionation associated with
carboxylation by Rubisco (27–29ø). See Eq. 4 later in
this paper for details on how D is calculated from d13C.
As can be seen from Eqs. 2 and 3, gas exchange
parameters can be assessed using tree ring estimates of
D. The relative immobility of carbon within the tree
rings allows us to examine the long-term, interannual D
patterns in response to stand basal area manipulations.
In the three previous studies on Pinus tree ring d13C or D
response to thinning, no response has been observed
(Leavitt and Long 1986), increased discrimination has
been observed and attributed to greater water avail-
ability (McDowell et al. 2003), and decreased discrimi-
nation has been observed and attributed to greater light
and nutrient availability (Warren et al. 2001).
Tree ring estimates of D can also allow us to determine
if gas exchange is maintained at a homeostatic set point
(Ehleringer 1993) after manipulation of stand basal area.
The ci value in Eqs. 2 and 3 is a result of the balance of

CO2 supply and demand (g and Pn), such that shifts in
the ratio of Pn/g cause direct changes in ci. The ratio
Pn/g, also known as intrinsic water-use efﬁciency
(Ehleringer 1993), is optimized to maximize Pn. In
semiarid conditions where g is low, this optimization
results in relatively high values of Pn/g (Ehleringer
1993). However, plants with abundant moisture supply
often have lower Pn/g but higher absolute rates of gas
exchange. The decrease in Pn/g with increasing rates of
gas exchange results because g increases more than Pn
due to enzymatic and diffusional limitations on Pn
(Cowan 1985, Meinzer et al. 1993, Buckley et al. 1999,
McDowell et al. 2003). Despite interannual ﬂuctuations
in water availability, long-term studies often ﬁnd that
gas exchange maintains ci/ca at a homeostatic set point
(Ehleringer 1993, but see Marshall and Monserud 1996).
It remains to be seen how changes in stand basal area
will affect gas exchange metabolism over the long term.
In a 15-year retrospective study on the response to
thinning in an Oregon ponderosa pine forest, McDowell
et al. (2003) observed that reduced stand basal area
resulted in higher absolute rates of Pn and g and a
decline in the ratio Pn/g. However, shifts in Pn/g may
not be maintained over decades if Al:As changes or if
competing vegetation becomes reestablished (Oren et al.
1987, McDowell et al. 2003). Therefore, the inﬂuence of
stand basal area on homeostatic maintenance of gas
exchange remains unclear.
The long-term homeostasis between crown-scale
physiological and whole-tree structural behavior is
critical to understanding the sustainability of tree
productivity in response to ecological restoration treat-
ments. The goal of our study was to examine the
interaction between physiological and structural mech-
anisms of response to competition using a long-term,
replicated study of ponderosa pine response to thinning
in which basal area was manipulated to seven different
levels. In particular, we sought to determine the long-
term pattern of growth, crown-scale gas exchange
metabolism, and Al:As of ponderosa pine trees in
response to changes in competition. Using Eqs. 1 and 2
and previous observations from a similar study (Mc-
Dowell et al. 2003) as our basis for hypotheses, we
predicted that: (1) during the ﬁrst decade after stand
basal area reductions, D would increase in response to
stand basal area reduction, (2) over the long term, Al:As
would increase in response to stand basal area reduc-
tions, and (3) long-term homeostatic adjustments would
hold D constant across all stand densities after the ﬁrst
decade.
METHODS
Study site
The experimental site is the Taylor Woods portion of
the Fort Valley Experimental Station (3581601100 N,
11184403000 W) located within the Coconino National
Forest ;15 km northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.
The stand is ;35.6 ha in area (Ronco et al. 1985), and is
dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var.
scopulorum) that regenerated naturally ca. 1919 (Ronco
et al. 1985, Savage et al. 1996). The trees were ;84 years
old during the time of our ﬁeld experiment (summer
2003). Overstory and total (overstory and understory)
leaf area index for the stands is not correlated with stand
density, and averages 1.52 and 1.62 m2/m2 ground area,
respectively (N. G. McDowell, H. D. Adams, J. D.
Bailey, and T. E. Kolb, unpublished manuscript; Table 1).
The leaf area of understory grasses and forbs increased
exponentially with declining stand density, to a max-
imum leaf area index of 0.25 m2/m2 ground area (N. G.
McDowell, H. D. Adams, J. D. Bailey, and T. E. Kolb,
unpublished manuscript). The stand has ﬂat topography
and is located at 2266 m elevation. The soils are classiﬁed
as a montmorillontic complex of frigid Typic Argiborolls
and Argiboralfs (Wollum and Schubert 1975, Ronco et
al. 1985). Mean annual temperature from 1909 to 1990
near the study site was 6.08C and mean annual
precipitation was 56.4 cm, with approximately half of
this amount falling as snow (Schubert 1974, NOAA
1990). This region experiences a monsoonal climate
typical of the southwest United States, with precipitation
distributed in a bimodal pattern that peaks in the winter
(November–March) and late summer (July–August), and
a pronounced drought during May and June.
Experimental design
We utilized a replicated set of stand basal area
treatments to test our hypotheses regarding physiolog-
ical and structural responses to changes in stand basal
area. The initial experiment was designed by the USDA
Forest Service to determine the effects of stand basal
area on ponderosa pine growth (Myers 1967, Ronco et
al. 1985). The forest was thinned originally in October
1962 to generate three replicated plots of each treatment
basal area, where the residual basal areas of the seven
treatment densities were 45 m2/ha (the uncut control),
34, 28, 23, 18, 14, and 7 m2/ha. It is worth noting that

early 1900s (8 m2/ha; Moore et al. 2003) was similar to
our lowest density treatment. The residual basal area
was maintained by rethinning each plot once per decade,
resulting in removal of trees in 1972, 1982, 1992, and
during the last half of our two-week experimental phase
in June 2003. The plots are about 0.4 ha in size, and have
0–10 m buffers. Data for tree density, diameter, height,
and leaf area index for each basal area level are shown in
Table 1. Although the unthinned plots have experienced
some mortality resulting from self-thinning, no recent
mortality has occurred in any of the plots as a result of
bark beetle infestation.
Basal area increment (BAI, in square centimeters per
year) was measured on three interior trees per plot, three
plots per treatment. For D and Al:As we measured ﬁve
interior trees per plot in one plot for each treatment.
This was done to minimize the workload and costs to
achievable levels for the Al:As and isotopic measure-
ments. Basal area increment was statistically indistin-
guishable between the intensive plots and the replicated
plots (ANOVA P ¼ 0.71); therefore the D and Al:As
values from these plots should be representative of each
treatment. The plots are referred to as intensive and
replicated plots throughout the remainder of the paper,
where intensive indicates that a large assortment of
measurements were made on one plot per treatment, and
replicated indicates that BAI was measured. Thus, BAI
was the only measurement that was truly replicated over
three plots per treatment. Five trees were harvested from
each of the intensive plots between 9 and 13 June 2003,
as part of the decadal thinnings to maintain treatment
basal area. Additionally, three or more trees were
harvested and sampled for growth from all remaining
plots in November 2003. We attempted to utilize trees
that were of average size (height and diameter) for each
treatment. Stem diameter at breast height (1.3 m, dbh)
of the harvested trees tended to be slightly less (8%) than
the plot average as measured by the regression slope of
stand mean diameter at breast height (dbh) vs. harvested
trees dbh (slope ¼ 0.92, r2 ¼ 0.98, P , 0.01). Both the
intensive and replicated plots were used for measure-
ments of soil water availability and photosynthesis in an
earlier study in 1994 (Kolb et al. 1998). Leaf gas
exchange and water potential data were measured
biweekly on eight dates between May and September
1994, on 3–5 trees per plot in two plots per treatment
(Kolb et al. 1998). Also, we measured photosynthetic
capacity in 2003 (see Photosynthetic capacity). As in any
retrospective study that mixes data sets collected during
disparate times, it is essential to remember that
measurements from recent years may not be indicative
of behavior during earlier years. Therefore, we consider
measurements of water potential, gas exchange, and tree
structure that were conducted in the 1990s and 2000s as
representative of those times, and urge caution when
extending these results to interpret isotope and growth
data from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
Productivity
We assessed aboveground productivity from tree ring
analysis of BAI. After trees were felled we removed
stemwood cross sections from a height of ;1.3 m from
each stump with chainsaws. Cross sections were sub-
sequently air dried for three months prior to further
analysis. We sanded the cross sections using successively
ﬁner sandpaper of FEPA (Federation of European
Producers of Abrasives, Paris, France) 100, 220, and
320 grit (162, 68, and 44.7–47.7 lm, respectively; Orvis
and Grissino-Mayer 2002) using a belt sander (Makita
USA, La Mirada, California, USA). When necessary we
also used FEPA 400 grit sandpaper (33.5–36.5 lm, Orvis
and Grissino-Mayer 2002). We measured ring widths
using a Microcode II banister measuring system (Boeck-
ler Instruments, Tucson, Arizona) attached to a PC
running the Measure J2X software (available online).5
Cores were cross-dated visually using narrow marker
years from tree ring chronologies collected at local sites
for ponderosa pine (Adams and Kolb 2004). We checked
measurements for accuracy using skeleton plots (Stokes
and Smiley 1968) and the COFECHA software program
(Holmes et al. 1986, Grissino-Mayer 2001, International
Tree Ring Data Bank program library). Ring widths
were converted to BAI from 1950 to 2001 using tree-
speciﬁc cross-sectional radii (inside bark) and assuming
concentric circularity. Missing rings were rare except for
1999 through 2002 in trees from the unthinned treatment.
We stopped measurement at 2001 because 2002 was a
year of severe drought and most trees did not form rings
that year except for trees in the lowest density treatment
(7 m2/ha). BAI results are presented at the individual plot
level and entire treatment (basal area) level.
Carbon isotope discrimination
We measured d13C of tree rings and related this to D
(Farquhar et al. 1982):
D ’ d13C  d13Ca
1 þ d13C=1000 :
ð4Þ
We obtained annual atmospheric stable carbon
isotope ratios (d13Ca) from the Institute for Arctic and
Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of
Colorado and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL). Eq. 4 corrects for
annual depletion of d13Ca associated with fossil fuel
emissions of CO2 depleted in d13C (Leavitt and Long
1988a, Keeling et al. 1989). This correction is necessary
because a change in the d13C of CO2 used as the
substrate for photosynthesis causes a physiologically
independent change in the d13C of plant material.
The stable isotope composition of tree rings was
assessed in two data sets: (1) a short-term assessment of
the response of D to the 1962 thinning for each
5 hwww.voortech.com/projectj2x/tringMainV2.htmli
June 2006

HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE OF GAS EXCHANGE
treatment, and (2) a long-term assessment of the D
pattern in relation to thinning over four decades. For the
short-term assessment we determined D for ﬁve trees
from each of the intensive plots for the 15 years
bracketing the 1962 thinning (1958–1972). For the
long-term assessment we determined D for the years
1952–2001 (49 years) for the 45, 28, 14, and 7 m2/ha
intensive plots. The long-term assessment used a single
pooled sample of ﬁve trees (i.e., rings) per plot and per
year. The short-term assessment provides the estimate of
within-plot D variance, and the long-term assessment is
used to determine the long-term D response to thinning.
To allow a statistical test of the long-term patterns, we
also ran samples from a nondrought year (1992) and a
drought year (2000) for the 45 and 7 m2/ha plots using
ﬁve trees per plot.
After the stemwood cross sections of the ﬁve trees
from each of the intensive plots had been cross-dated
and measured we removed ﬁne-grain particles of wood
from all rings using a Dremel tool (Robert Bosch Tool
Corporation, Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA) with a
2.38 mm (3/32 inch) diameter diamond bit. We removed
wood from a 3–10 cm circumferential path along the
ring, starting at a location where the ring was
sufﬁciently wide to ensure no cross-year contamination.
The path along the ring should have reduced d13C
variability due to circumferential variation (Leavitt and
Long 1984, 1988b). We did not attempt to separate early
from late wood (Livingston and Spittlehouse 1996,
Leavitt and Wright 2002) because our objective was to
examine the response of D to stand basal area at the
annual timestep. We were able to remove wood
successfully from individual rings without contamina-
tion from neighboring rings except in the case of some
rings from the uncut control plot (45 m2/ha) where the
rings were often smaller than the ﬁnest point of the
diamond bit. We estimate that the annual estimates of D
for the control plot may be up to 5% contaminated by
neighboring rings; thus the control plot time series of D
may appear smoother than reality. We did not extract
cellulose prior to measurement of d13C because: (1)
numerous studies have reported constant relationships
between cellulose and whole-wood d13C for sapwood
(Livingston and Spittlehouse 1996, Marshall and
Monserud 1996, Macfarlane et al. 1999, Loader et al.
2003), (2) most cross-ring contamination is associated
with carbon movement from the sapwood into the
heartwood (S. Leavitt, personal communication) and all
of our sample rings were located within the sapwood,
and (3) Eqs. 2–4 were designed for foliar gas exchange,
and whole wood has undergone less metabolic process-
ing postassimilation than cellulose per se (Hill et al.
1995). The ﬁne dust collected from each ring was
analyzed on a Eurovector Elemental Analyzer (Euro-
vector S.P.A., Milan, Italy) coupled to a Micromass
Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GV Instru-
ments, Manchester, UK) operated in continuous ﬂow
mode at Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Stable
Isotope Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.
Nitrous oxide was removed by gas chromatography and
corrections for 17O (Craig 1957) were done for all runs.
A total of 297 tree ring samples were run and overall
precision for d13C was 0.05ø (n ¼ 103).
Leaf area : sapwood area ratio
We capitalized on the thinning in June 2003 to collect
samples for calculating whole-tree leaf area : sapwood
area ratio (Al:As, m2/cm2). Whole-tree leaf area was
estimated by scaling branch estimates of leaf area to the
canopy (Maguire and Batista 1996, Monserud and
Marshall 1999, McDowell et al. 2002b). Branch-scale
allometric equations were developed through branch
harvest and analysis for ﬁve trees from each of the
intensive plots. We harvested branches immediately
after each tree was felled to prevent any needle loss
due to desiccation. Nine branches were harvested from
throughout the height continuum of the crown for each
of ﬁve trees per plot. Branches were harvested from all
aspects, although previous research found no effect of
aspect (McDowell et al. 2002b). The entire foliage mass
for each branch (Mb) was collected in industrial-size
paper bags and transported back to the laboratory. In
the laboratory, foliage from each branch was randomly
subsampled to determine speciﬁc leaf area (S, cm2/g).
Projected leaf area was determined using a video image
recorder and AgVision software (Decagon Devices,
Pullman, Washington, USA). The remaining foliage
was dried at 658C until the mass had stabilized and then
weighed. Because of the small stature of the trees in the
uncut control plot, we measured whole-tree leaf area for
four of the ﬁve sampled trees, and used the branch
regression approach for the ﬁfth, largest, tree. Foliage
was processed identically to the methods described
earlier.
Based on previous results (Hubbard et al. 1999,
Fischer et al. 2002, McDowell et al. 2002b), we used
branch diameter (d) to estimate Mb. Scatterplots of Mb
vs. d revealed that variance in Mb did not consistently
increase with larger values of d and the relationships
were linear; therefore we used standard linear regression
rather than weighted regression (Monserud and Mar-
shall 1999, McDowell et al. 2002b). The d vs. Mb
regressions had a mean r2 of 0.56, P , 0.01, when
averaged across all sample trees (n ¼ 31). Mean slopes
and intercepts for the regressions from each treatment
are presented in Table 2. We used tree-speciﬁc d vs. Mb
regressions to scale Mb up to the entire crown for each
of the sample trees. This scaling was done using
measurements of d collected on every live branch for
every tree immediately after the tree was felled. Branch
diameter d was measured with calipers 20 mm proximal
to the main stem in two perpendicular directions for all
branches.
Speciﬁc leaf area (S) exhibited a weak but consistent
increase with increasing distance from the tree tops for
all plots (r2 ranged from 0.19 to 0.42). Because of this

consistent trend of increasing S with increasing distance
from the tree top (or increasing proximity to the
ground), we applied plot-speciﬁc S – branch height
corrections prior to multiplying S to Mb for estimating
whole-branch leaf area. The treatment-speciﬁc slopes
and intercepts for S  branch height regressions are
presented in Table 2. Occasionally the predictions of
branch leaf area were negative when branches had
extremely small diameters. Negative leaf areas for these
branches were set to zero.
Sapwood area was estimated from the stemwood
cross sections for each tree. The sapwood–heartwood
boundary was usually clear; however, we applied
bromocresol green stain (Kutscha and Sachs 1962) to
verify all visual estimates. On each cross section,
sapwood depth was measured for four cambium-to-
heartwood transects located at right angles to each
other, with a random start location for the ﬁrst transect.
Sapwood depths were averaged and sapwood area was
estimated assuming concentric circularity.
Photosynthetic capacity
Photosynthetic capacity can inﬂuence D by increasing
or decreasing Pn and subsequently causing an inverse
change in ci/ca (Eq. 3). We examined photosynthetic
capacity using response curves of photosynthetic
assimilation to internal [CO2] (A vs. Ci curves). The A
vs. Ci curves were measured on four trees in the 7 m2/ha
intensive plot, ﬁve trees in the 23 m2/ha intensive plot,
and eight trees in the 45 m2/ha intensive plot. The
sample sizes varied because it became apparent during
our ﬁeld measurements that the 45 m2/ha plot had
greater intertree variability than the other two plots. We
made the measurements from 0700 to 1200 in the
morning on two consecutive sunny, cloudless days (4
and 5 June 2003). Foliage from the upper 10% of the
canopy was measured in situ using a moveable 20-m
boom lift (Sunstate Rentals, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA).
The A vs. Ci curves were measured with a LI-COR 6400
portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR, Lincoln,
Nebraska, USA). The cuvette irradiance was main-
tained at 1400 lmol of photonsm2s1 using a blue-red
light source, well above photosynthetic light saturation
for ponderosa pine (800 lmol of photonsm2s1,
Hadley 1969, Kolb and Roberrecht 1996). A vs. Ci
curves were generated by changing the cuvette CO2 in
the following order: 400, 300, 200, 100, 400, 600, 800,
and 1200 lmol/mol. We did not expose the foliage to
higher CO2 partial pressures because our goal was only
to ascertain the maximum catalytic activity of Rubisco
(Vcmax). After each exposure to a new CO2 level, net
photosynthesis was allowed to reach steady state
(cuvette CO2 coefﬁcient of variation ,2%) prior to
measurement. Three measurements were made per
sample per CO2 level over a 60-second period after
steady state had been reached. Vcmax was calculated
from the A vs. Ci curves using nonlinear, least squares
regression to ﬁt the values of these parameters to the
equations of the Farquhar et al. (1980) photosynthesis
model (Harley et al. 1992). Parameters were temper-
ature corrected to 258C using the equations of Leuning
(1997), and the activation energies from Harley et al.
(1992). Calculation of Vcmax was typically done using Ci
values ,300 lmol/mol when the slope was quasilinear
(Wullschleger 1993).
Water potential
Predawn foliage water potential from overstory trees
provides an index of soil water potential (Ws) within the
rooting zone if nocturnal transpiration is consistent
between treatments or is negligible (Donovan et al. 2001,
Bucci et al. 2004). The parameter Ws was measured twice
a month from May to September 1994 from the 45, 28,
18, and 7 m2/ha treatments (Kolb et al. 1998). Kolb et al.
measured predawn foliage water potential from 5 to 10
trees per treatment and from the lower and upper
portions of the canopy, but did not correct these values
for the hydrostatic gradient (0.01 MPa/m). We corrected
their values for the hydrostatic gradient based on branch
height above the ground. The corrected values were then
averaged and used to assess the response of Ws to stand
basal area. Midday leaf water potential (Wl) was also
TABLE 2.
Stand and individual tree structural regressions were used to predict branch leaf mass (Mb) from branch diameter (d ),
and speciﬁc leaf area (S) from the distance to the top of the tree.

HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE OF GAS EXCHANGE
measured in 1994 on the same trees as the Ws measure-
ments. We have summarized these for the entire
summer, averaged by treatment; in addition we calcu-
lated treatment mean Ws – Wl (Eq. 1). Other details on
sampling procedure are given in Kolb et al. (1998).
Ancillary gas exchange data
In conjunction with the 1994 Ws measurements, Kolb
et al. (1998) also measured leaf-level gas exchange twice
a month from May to September 1994 from the 45, 28,
18, and 7 m2/ha treatments. The Kolb et al. measure-
ments were conducted between 1000 and 1300 each day.
They measured Pn and g from three to seven trees per
treatment from the lower and upper crowns under
ambient humidity and temperature and with light
incident on the foliage . 1000 lmol photonsm2s1.
They did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in gas exchange
with crown position, so we have averaged the values to
provide crown mean rates of gas exchange. In the
current study we used the gas exchange data to: (1)
investigate the absolute rates of Pn and g and their ratio
(Eq. 3) for a single summer within our inference period,
and (2) examine the relationship between gas exchange,
Ws, and BAI.
Climatic response
We were curious if stand basal area treatments would
cause differential dependency of growth on drought. To
assess this question, we examined relationships between
BAI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for
each treatment in the 40 years following the initial stand
basal area manipulations. PDSI is a measure of
meteorological drought calculated from precipitation,
temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (Palmer
1965, Alley 1984). We used annually averaged instru-
mental PDSI data for Region 2 of Arizona, available
from the National Climatic Data Center (available
online).6 PDSI was used as the independent variable in
regression analysis with BAI and with basal area
normalized BAI (BAI/BA). Normalization was done to
account for the inherent differences in tree size that
occurred in the decades following the stand basal area
treatments, allowing us to examine the relative responses
of trees to drought.
Statistics
We tested the hypotheses that BAI and D varied
among stand basal area levels using regression analysis
of values averaged from 1962 to 2001 to account for
interannual variability due to climate or decadal
harvests. We did a similar regression analysis with Al:As
measured in 2003 as the dependent factor. To assess the
time period of signiﬁcant responses we used blocked
repeated measures analysis of variance for BAI and D in
which the blocks represent different basal area treat-
ments. Differences in Vcmax, Ws, and leaf-level Pn and g
among stand basal area treatments were tested using
analysis of variance. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the
regression results presented are the best statistical ﬁt of a
variety of regression forms tested. We conducted all tests
with SYSTAT 11.0 (SYSTAT 2004).
RESULTS
Overall response to stand basal area reductions
Average tree BAI increased in response to stand basal
area reductions (Fig. 1). Pre-thinning BAI did not differ
between any of the plots except the 45 m2/ha treatment,
which had lower BAI (P , 0.01). This difference is
probably due to our sample selection criteria, which was
to harvest the ‘‘average’’ tree based on height and
diameter. The average tree in the 45 m2/ha plot in 2003
was small; however, similar small trees in the other
treatments were probably removed by the 1962 thinning.
Post-thinning BAI differed among plots (P , 0.01). The
magnitude of BAI response to thinning was a negative
function of residual stand basal area (Fig. 2). When
calculated as a percentage of BAI of the 45 m2/ha
treatment, the mean growth increase for the 7, 14, 18, 23,
28, and 34 m2/ha treatments over 40 years was 1770,
947, 808, 597, 570, and 371%, respectively.
Carbon isotope discrimination also responded to
stand basal area reductions (Fig. 3). Prior to thinning
(1958–1961), D was not statistically different among
plots (P¼0.11, Fig. 3A); however, there was a difference
of almost 1.0ø across treatments. In order to equitably
compare responses without the interference of pretreat-
ment variation, we calculated normalized D that
accounts for within-plot, pretreatment differences using
the equation: Y ¼ D(year X)  mean D(1958–1961) (see
Carpenter et al. 1989 and Fig. 3B). Again there was no
difference in normalized D prior to thinning (P ¼ 0.16,
Fig. 3B). This normalization does not account for
climatic variation from year to year. Therefore, to
clearly test for the effects of stand basal area without
interference of climate, we standardized the pre-thinning
normalized data for each year (Fig. 3B) based on the
normalized data from the control, unthinned stand (45
m2/ha). Using Y from the equation presented above for
pre-thin normalization, the equation for normalization
by the control stand is: Ytrt X  Yctl. In this normal-
ization, control plot mean D is used as an index of
climatic variation that is free of thinning effects. Using
this ﬁnal normalized D, we again observed no pre-thin
differences (P ¼ 0.61). Normalized D (Fig. 3C) was
similar among basal area levels for four years following
treatment (P ¼ 0.45), but signiﬁcant differences occurred
for years 5–12 after the initial thinning in 1962 (P ,
0.01). Normalized D, 5–12 years after the initial
thinning, was negatively related to stand basal area
(Fig. 4). In other words, D declined with increasing stand
basal area during the period 5–12 years after thinning.
The long-term trend in D from the 45, 28, 14, and 7
m2/ha intensive plots shown in Fig. 5 exhibits some

interesting patterns. Fig. 5 (B,C) was calculated using
the same normalization schemes as in Fig. 3 (B,C).
Similar to Fig. 3A, the 45 m2/ha treatment had a slightly
above-average D prior to thinning and below-average D
for years 5–12 after the initial thinning in 1962 (Fig. 5A).
After correction for pre-thinning differences (Fig. 5B),
the 45 m2/ha treatment had the lowest D for years 5–12
after the initial thinning; however, this difference
disappeared in subsequent years with the exception of
1983–1985. After standardizing D from the three thinned
plots by the unthinned 45 m2/ha plot to account for
year-to-year climatic variation, it appears that D was not
different from the control plot for the ﬁrst four years
after the initial thinning, and then was substantially
different for approximately years 5–12 after thinning.
This result is similar to the pattern observed using the
replicated data set (Fig. 3C). Notably, there was no
apparent variation in normalized D with stand basal
area during the remaining decades except during an
unusually wet period in the mid 1980s, when D was
lowest for the control plot, and an unusually dry period
in the 1990s, when D was highest for the control plot.
Statistical comparisons between the intensive plots
were not conducted because only one single, pooled
sample was analyzed per treatment per year. However,
the patterns that emerged from the long-term data set
FIG. 1.

which had a single plot. Bars represent 6SE. The initial thinning treatment (1962) and subsequent thinning treatments (1972, 1982,
1992) are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. (B) Annual PDSI for Region 2 of Arizona (NCDC–NOAA). Negative PDSI values

were conﬁrmed with larger samples sizes for two years
(1992 and 2000) for the 7 and 45 m2/ha treatments. The
values for ﬁve trees per plot in the 7 and 45 m2/ha
treatments (mean and standard error) were 17.80 6
0.04ø and 17.79 6 0.06ø during the nondrought year
of 1992 (t test, P ¼ 0.83), and 16.1 6 0.08ø and 17.6 6
0.07ø during the drought year of 2000 (t test, P ,
0.001). These values are within 0.05ø of the pooled
sample values from those same years and treatments.
The relationship between long-term BAI from Fig. 1
and pre-thin normalized D from Fig. 5B differed among
basal area treatments (Fig. 6). Although the regressions
are weak (r2 ¼ 0.16–0.31), the slopes are signiﬁcantly
different among treatments (P , 0.001). The slope of
BAI vs. normalized D was negatively related to stand
basal area; as stand basal area declined, BAI was more
strongly related to incremental changes in normalized D.
Leaf area : sapwood area
Whole-tree leaf area and sapwood area both declined
with stand basal area. The regression equation describ-
ing the decline for leaf area is: Al ¼ 82.55 3 ln(basal
area) þ 308.6 (r2 ¼ 0.99, P , 0.01). The regression
equation describing the decline for sapwood area is: As¼
519.2 3 ln(basal area) þ 2086 (r2 ¼ 0.97, P , 0 .01).
Leaf area and sapwood area exhibited different
responses to stand basal area, however, resulting in a
strong negative correlation between Al:As and stand
basal area (r2 ¼ 0.93, P , 0.01; Fig. 7). Mean Al:As
ranged from a minimum of 0.04 m2/cm2 in the 45 m2/ha
stand to a maximum of 0.14 m2/cm2 in the 7 m2/ha
stand.
Photosynthetic capacity, water potential,
and in situ gas exchange
Photosynthetic capacity assessed using Vcmax calcu-
lated from A vs. Ci curves did not vary with stand basal
area (P¼0.61, data not shown). The values for the 7, 28,
and 45 m2/ha intensive plots (mean and standard error)
were 59.7 6 9.0, 49.6 6 2.3, and 62.1 6 11.1
lmolm2s1, respectively.
Net photosynthetic rate and Ws during the summer of
1994 clearly varied with stand basal area. Both Pn and
Ws were greatest in the 7 m2/ha intensive plot and
declined signiﬁcantly as basal area increased (r2¼0.99, P
¼ 0.01 for both, Fig. 8A, B). We also plotted BAI from
1994 for comparison (Fig. 8C), which showed a decline
consistent with the overall trend shown in Fig. 2.
Stomatal conductance showed a similar, but weaker
pattern with stand basal area as Pn (r2 ¼ 0.80, P ¼ 0.09,
data not shown). There was a positive, nonlinear
relationship between BAI and Ws (Fig. 9A), and a
positive linear relationship between BAI and Pn (Fig.
9B). Despite large differences in the absolute rates of gas
exchange among treatments, intrinsic water use efﬁ-
ciency (Pn/g) exhibited no trend with stand basal area (P
¼ 0.17, data not shown).
Midday W averaged over the entire summer of 1994
for the 45, 28, 18, and 7 m2/ha intensive plots was (mean
6 SE) 1.68 6 0.06, 1.62 6 0.07, 1.65 6 0.09, and
1.51 6 0.09 MPa, respectively. For the 7 m2/ha
treatment, Wl was signiﬁcantly less negative than the
other treatments (P , 0.01). For the 45, 28, 18, and 7
m2/ha intensive plots, Ws – Wl averaged 0.79 6 0.09, 0.95
6 0.08, 1.02 6 0.13, and 1.01 6 0.11 MPa, respectively.
For the 45 m2/ha treatment, Ws – Wl was signiﬁcantly
smaller than for the other treatments (P ¼ 0.015).
Climatic response
PDSI varied from 3.34 to 5.26 over the 40-year
period from 1962 to 2001. Negative PDSI values
represent drought and positive PDSI values represent
wet periods. There was no relationship between PDSI
and BAI for positive PDSI years, and when all years
were combined the relationships were weak (data not
shown). However, for negative PDSI years, BAI was
positively correlated with PDSI for all treatments (Table
3). The slopes of BAI vs. PDSI (using the negative PDSI
years only) were negatively correlated with stand basal
area (Fig. 10A). This pattern remained after normalizing
BAI by tree basal area (BAI/BA, Table 3 and Fig. 10B).
Regressions of long-term D data from Fig. 5B vs. PDSI
consistently showed weak, positive relationships. The
slopes and correlation coefﬁcients (r2) for the 45, 28, 14,
and 7 m2/ha intensive plots were: 0.9 (0.26), 0.12 (0.17),
0.17 (0.45), and 0.08 (0.11), respectively. There was no
relationship between the slope of D/PDSI and basal area
(P ¼ 0.71).
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that variation in stand basal
area has long-term effects on the growth (Figs. 1, 2, and
6), physiology (Figs. 3–5, 8, and 9), and structure (Fig.
7) of ponderosa pine. The results are consistent with the
hypothesis that gas exchange homeostasis is achieved
through a balance of leaf- and whole-crown adjustments
to changes in Ws (Eq. 1). Crown-scale D inferred from

HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE OF GAS EXCHANGE
tree rings increased during the ﬁrst decade after
reductions in stand basal area, indicating reduced water
use efﬁciency (Figs. 3 and 4), but after 12 years D
returned to values similar to the trees in the unthinned
treatment, suggesting that D was maintained near a ‘‘set
point’’ (Fig. 5; Ehleringer 1993, Ehleringer and Cerling
1995). Al:As, in contrast, showed a signiﬁcant long-term
response to reduced stand basal area (Fig. 7). This shift
in Al:As is consistent with maintenance of D near the
observed set point. We presume that other physiological
and architectural shifts may also have occurred (e.g.,
belowground); however, the observed shifts are consis-
tent with homeostatic theory at the whole-tree (White-
head and Jarvis 1981) and leaf level (Ehleringer 1993).
Further, the results observed here have implications for
future research and application of thinning and eco-
logical restoration treatments.
Growth response
Changes in both leaf-level Pn and Al likely contributed
to the large and sustained response of BAI to stand
basal area reductions. Regarding leaf-level Pn, the
increased D during years 5–12 after the initial thinning
(Figs. 3 and 4) indicates a substantial increase in ci/ca,
which probably resulted from increased g. Given the
increased CO2 diffusion to the outer walls of the
mesophyll cells facilitated by elevated g, it is almost
certain that Pn increased during this period as well
(Cowan 1985, Meinzer et al. 1993, Buckley et al. 1999,
McDowell et al. 2003). It is possible that photosynthetic
capacity also increased in the ﬁrst few years after the
thinning due to elevated soil nitrogen availability
(Feeney et al. 1998, Kaye and Hart 1998), which would
act to enhance Pn above and beyond the increase due to
elevated g. Although the D response largely diminished
12 years after the initial thinning, the absolute rates of Pn
and g continued to be elevated in low basal area
treatments 32 years later (Figs. 8 and 9). Therefore, at
least a portion of the sustained BAI increase after
thinning resulted from elevated Pn per unit leaf area.
The sustained BAI response to stand basal area
reductions was also a response to increased Al:As (Fig.
7). Density dependence of Al:As has been observed
previously (Keane and Weetman 1987, Long and Smith
1988). Increased Al:As allows greater light interception
per unit respiratory carbon loss from sapwood respira-
tion (Ryan et al. 1995, Magnani et al. 2000). The
advantage of greater light interception per tree offered
by elevated Al:As is probably particularly manifest
during wetter years when g is less of a constraint on A
and hence the role of light interception in whole-tree
carbon gain is greater. This is consistent with the higher
slope of BAI vs. D in low basal area treatments (Fig. 6),
i.e., individual crown light interception could become a
large driver of productivity during nondrought years so
that larger crowns facilitate greater carbon gain per unit
shift in D.
We cannot partition the importance of increased Pn
per unit leaf area vs. increased total leaf area per tree on
total carbon gain in this study. Additionally, carbon
allocation may have changed in response to thinning
that resulted in enhanced BAI, such as reduced below-
ground carbon allocation (Haynes and Gower 1995,
McDowell et al. 2001, Ryan et al. 2004) or increased
carbon allocation to defenses (Kolb et al. 1998, Wallin et
al. 2004). Nonetheless, we suspect that greater rates of
Pn per unit leaf area and the greater leaf area per tree
and per sapwood area all facilitated greater whole-
crown Pn and BAI in the low-density treatments.
Homeostatic theory
Homeostatic maintenance of whole-tree gas exchange
results from a balance between biochemical capacity of
foliage to conduct photosynthesis and hydraulic con-
straints imposed by soil water availability and the
conducting properties of tree vascular systems (White-
head and Jarvis 1981, Sperry et al. 1998, Whitehead
1998, Brodribb and Holbrook 2003, Katul et al. 2003).
Little variation in photosynthetic capacity occurred
among basal area treatments in our study, which is
consistent with other long-term studies on ponderosa
pine response to thinning (McDowell et al. 2003, Sala et
al. 2005). However, the variation observed in Al:As and
Ws  Wl across the continuum of stand densities is
consistent with the concept of maximizing transpiration
per unit leaf area while minimizing the safety margin for
xylem cavitation (Tyree and Sperry 1988, Sperry et al.
1998). Hydraulic theory suggests that trees balance
factors in Eq. 1 along with properties such as root
development and sapwood porosity to maximize Ws Wl
such that maximum water uptake from the soil is
achieved while minimizing the risk of catastrophic xylem
embolism were Wl to become too negative (Sperry et al.
1998, Ewers et al. 1999, 2000). Data from the summer of
1994 showed that trees in the thinned treatments had

HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE OF GAS EXCHANGE
signiﬁcantly greater Ws  Wl than trees within the
unthinned, 45 m2/ha treatment (1.01 vs. 0.79 MPa, P ,
0.01). Greater Ws  Wl facilitates water extraction from
the soil, thereby maintaining g for greater cumulative
amounts of transpiration. Trees within the 45 m2/ha
treatment, in contrast, probably initiated stomatal
closure to prevent cavitation at lower transpiration
rates, thereby limiting Pn. Therefore, it appears that as
stand density decreased, less total soil water was used
and, as a consequence, Ws became less negative, allowing
trees to experience increased Ws  Wl and presumably g
and Pn. Furthermore, as stand density decreased,
individual tree leaf area increased, and this, with
increased g, increased total individual tree water use.
Notably, the more positive midday Wl in the 7 m2/ha
treatment suggests that trees in the low basal area
treatments have a greater safety margin from cavitation
(Tyree and Sperry 1988), which may explain why these
trees were the only ones that grew rings in 2002 (a year
of particularly severe drought). This increased margin of
safety may confer an advantage to trees at this low basal
area during drought years. Similar increases in Ws and
Wl after thinning have been observed (Sucoff and Hong
1974, Donner and Running 1986, Skov et al. 2004,
Wallin et al. 2004, Simonin et al. 2006), but not in all
studies (Cregg et al. 1990, Schmid et al. 1991).
The results of our study also support the concept that
the homeostatic gas exchange set point, or the parameter
that is regulated to stay constant regardless of changes in
resource availability, is ci/ca (Ehleringer 1993, Ehleringer
and Cerling 1995). We calculated ci/ca, ci, and ca  ci
from our 40-year d13C data set and Eqs. 3–4 (data not
shown). Treatment differences were the same as those
shown in Figs. 3 and 5, including a decrease in ca  ci
and an increase in ci and ci/ca for only the period 5–12
years after the initial thinning. Over the 40-year period,
ci for all treatments rose from a minimum of ;170 to
;200 lmol/mol, and ca  ci rose from a minimum of
;130 to ;170 lmol/mol. In contrast, ci/ca oscillated
between 0.50 and 0.60 over the same period, but
exhibited no trend with time. Similar results have been
reported using foliage d13C in ponderosa pine thinning
studies in Northern Arizona (Skov et al. 2004, Wallin et
al. 2004). The exact reason for maintaining ci /ca
constant is not clear. However, it can be seen from Eq.
4 that ca  ci ¼ Pn/g, which at constant vapor pressure
deﬁcit equals Pn/E, where E is transpiration. Therefore,
Pn/g increased over the four decades for all stand
densities. It may be more appropriate to consider that
plants in water-limited environments operate to max-
imize Pn/E (Cowan 1982, Ehleringer et al. 1992) rather
than hold ci/ca constant per se. The rise in Pn/g over time
in our study may be driven by reduced hydraulic
conductance associated with increasing tree size, which
forces a reduction in g (Yoder et al. 1994, Hubbard et al.
1999, Kolb and Stone 2000, Monserud and Marshall
2001, McDowell et al. 2002a). When tree size is held
constant over time by sampling the young, inner rings of
variously aged trees, no increase in Pn/g occurs over time
(Marshall and Monserud 1996).
Climatic sensitivity and forest sustainability
The impacts of drought on forest growth and survival
are a signiﬁcant international concern, particularly in
the southwestern United States where drought has
initiated widespread limitations to photosynthetic gas

exchange of ponderosa pine (Feeney et al. 1998, Leavitt
and Wright 2002, Skov et al. 2004), and has severely
impacted growth and survival of ponderosa and pin˜ on
pine (Pinus edulis) (Allen and Breashers 1998, Ogle et al.
2000, Adams and Kolb 2004). High stand densities in
contemporary forests may be exacerbating the effects of
drought on these forests (Skov et al. 2004; N. G.
McDowell and D. A. Falk, unpublished data; but see
Zausen et al. 2005) because of the particularly extreme
competition for water in high basal area stands (Fig. 8).
We speculated that one beneﬁt of thinning would be to
reduce the negative effect of drought on growth. If this
hypothesis were true, then reductions in stand density
may be a proactive method to alleviate the negative
impacts of climate change on tree growth.
The results of this study show that tree growth in low
basal area treatments is more resilient to drought than
growth in high basal area treatments, e.g., 1989, 1996,
and 2000 (Fig. 1). This higher minimum BAI is
presumably a result of the numerous advantages that
the larger trees in the low basal area treatments have,
such as larger root systems (Dawson 1996), a greater
margin of safety from cavitation because of less xylem
tension (i.e., higher Wl), and greater Ws  Wl. Therefore,
it is reasonable to predict that as periodic droughts
continue into the future, ponderosa pine trees will have
greater growth and potentially greater survival in forests
where stand basal area has been reduced toward
presettlement levels.
Although BAI of low basal area treatments is more
resilient to drought than BAI of high basal area
treatments, the low basal area treatments were also
more sensitive to drought (Figs. 5, 6, and 10, Table 2).
Fig. 10A and Table 2 clearly show that the response of
BAI to incremental changes in PDSI increased with
decreasing stand basal area. Even after normalizing the
BAI data for the inherent growth differences associated
with tree size (e.g., relative growth rate), growth of trees
from low basal area treatments remained more sensitive
to PDSI than growth of trees from high basal area
treatments (Fig. 10B, Table 2). While trees in stands
with low basal area have numerous hydraulic advan-
tages mentioned previously, they may also be predis-
posed to greater variation in gas exchange associated
with variation in water availability. There are numerous
lines of evidence in support of this idea. First, D of the
thinned treatments was elevated above D of the
unthinned treatment during the particularly wet years
of 1983–1988 (average PDSI 3.2), and was lower during

HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE OF GAS EXCHANGE
the particularly dry years of 1996 and 2000 (PDSI¼2.4
and 3.3, respectively, Figs. 1B and 5B, C). This ﬁnding
suggests that gas exchange is more variable for thinned
than nonthinned treatments in response to drought.
Second, the range of D values is larger for thinned than
unthinned treatments (see X axis, Fig. 6). Third, the
response of growth to changes in gas exchange (BAI/D)
was steeper for lower basal area treatments, indicating
that incremental changes in gas exchange result in
increasingly larger changes in BAI with decreasing stand
basal area (Fig. 6). The reason for this greater gas
exchange and growth sensitivity to drought in the low
basal area treatments may be associated with the larger
leaf area per tree. During wet years, the positive gas
exchange response was distributed over a large leaf area,
allowing greater whole-tree photosynthesis and hence
greater BAI than trees with low leaf area. However,
during dry years, these large leaf areas may have
burdened the trees with a large transpirational demand.
In accordance with Eq. 1, large leaf area can cause
reduced g if soil water availability is limited. This
balance between transpiring leaf area and g has been
demonstrated over short times scales (Whitehead et al.
1996). In other words, trees in the high basal area
treatments were relatively unable to take advantage of
climatically wet years due to structural limitations (e.g.,
small root systems, low sapwood permeability), and
likewise, they were already so severely water stressed due
to competition that drought had little further effect on
gas exchange.
CONCLUSIONS
Reductions in stand basal area in semiarid forests are
likely to facilitate greater photosynthesis and growth of
trees above those of trees growing at high basal areas. A
primary driver of this response is the increased avail-
ability of soil water; however, the proximate cause is at
least partially a result of a homeostatic balance of gas
exchange at the leaf- and whole-crown levels. Short-term
shifts in the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal
conductance (D) were balanced via changes in above-
ground architecture (Al:As) that resulted over the long
term in greater leaf- and crown-scale photosynthesis.
These results are consistent with established theory
regarding the homeostatic maintenance of gas exchange
at the leaf and whole-plant levels. Notably, both the

greater in the lower basal area treatments, so ecological

rates (on an individual tree basis) but also greater
