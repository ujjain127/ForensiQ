Experience with universal bacterial culturing
to detect contamination of apheresis platelet
units in a hospital transfusion service

BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet
units poses one of the greatest risks of morbidity and
mortality to platelet transfusion recipients. A routine cul-
ture of all units (WBC-reduced apheresis platelet units)
was instituted on Day 2 over a 2-year period to reduce
this risk.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A sterile connecting
device was used to attach a small transfer pack on the
morning of Day 2 after collection, and 10 mL of the unit
were transferred to the small bag. After disconnection
from the unit, about half of this volume was transferred
to an aerobic culture bottle of an automated bacterial
detection system. Units were maintained in available
inventory until and unless a report was received of
growth in the sample. When available, the unit or a re-
tained aliquot was recultured if the initial sample was
positive. Units were held up to 2 days beyond their
5-day outdate and used for transfusion if no other suit-
able units were available to meet the clinical need or
were evaluated with in vitro testing on Day 8.
RESULTS: Of 2678 units cultured, 16 (0.6%) were posi-
tive on initial culture. Thirteen could be recultured, and
all of these samples were negative. Shortly after the
2-year period of the study, two units (split from the
same collection) were documented as growing coagu-
lase-negative Staphylococci 12 hours after sampling.
Units transfused on Day 6 or 7 (n = 40) yielded ex-
pected clinical responses, and CCI available on 21 re-
cipients 10 to 60 minutes after transfusion demonstrated
acceptable results (mean, 14,400 ± 8800; median,
12,191; 90% > 7500). More than 96 percent of units
tested on Day 8 had pH greater than 6.2 and continued
to demonstrate swirling.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine culturing of apheresis platelet
units is feasible, can be accomplished with a low rate of
false positivity, and can detect contaminated units. The
cost of such a protocol could be mitigated with exten-
sion of the storage period, and clinical experience with
units held for 6 or 7 days was satisfactory.
B
acterial contamination poses one of the great-
est risks of morbidity and mortality faced by the
recipients of platelet transfusions. Approxi-
mately 1 in 22,000 to 1 in 3000 units of platelets
are contaminated with bacteria originating from the do-
nor’s skin or bloodstream.1,2 Although only a portion of
these result in clinically recognized post transfusion sep-
tic events and not all of these are fatal, careful follow-up
of platelet transfusion recipients in France has docu-
mented that the death rate from bacterially contaminated
units is seven per million apheresis units transfused, or 1
in 140,000.3 In the United States, longitudinal study of
platelet transfusion recipients in one institution has
documented the risk of sepsis after receipt of apheresis
platelets as 75 per million (1/13,000) and 402 per million
(1/2500) after whole blood-derived platelet units; the
risks of fatality were documented as 14 per million
(1/71,000) and 62 per million (1/16,000), respectively, for
these two platelet sources.4 These risks exceed those of
HIV and HCV transmission by more than an order of
magnitude.5,6
Various approaches have been suggested to reduce
the chance of bacteria being collected with the unit or to
detect their presence. Augmented skin cleansing prepa-
rations and diversion of the first milliliters of blood may
reduce by 75 to 90 percent the risk of skin commensal
bacteria entering the unit.7-9 Consumption of glucose by
contaminating bacteria may be detected directly or
through changes in pH that then may also be reflected as

loss of swirling.10-14 The sensitivity of these techniques
appears suboptimal, although averaging 75 percent, and
a large, potentially fatal, inoculum (in excess of 106 CFU/
mL) must be present before the necessary change can be
detected. Similarly, microscopic examination of a smear
from the unit shortly before transfusion, using either
gram staining or a fluorescent stain, such as acridine or-
ange, have sensitivities in the range of 105 to 106 CFU per
mL with a substantial false-positive rate.15,16 A variety of
methods to detect bacteria in platelet units are under
development by commercial manufacturers.
In bacteriology, culture is regarded as the “gold stan-
dard” for sterility testing. This approach poses challenges
in transfusion medicine, however, because the initial in-
oculum may be so low (often projected at 0.1-10 CFU/
mL) that detection by culture would require culturing so
large a portion of the unit that its therapeutic effective-
ness would be diminished significantly. Furthermore,
blood banks and transfusion service laboratories do not
culture units routinely and may lack automated equip-
ment that facilitates large-scale culturing. The inevitable
time lag between obtaining the culture and detecting
growth further complicates the management of platelet
units because of their short shelf life.
To reduce the substantial threat posed by bacterial
contamination of platelet units, we began culturing all
apheresis platelet units in May 1999. Our approach was
modeled after techniques implemented successfully in
several European blood centers17-20 and was also based
on observations in our laboratory and elsewhere that a
small volume cultured on Day 2 after spiking bacteria
into a platelet unit would consistently contain bacteria
despite a low initial inoculum.12,21 By retaining units be-
yond their usual 5-day outdate, we accumulated data
augmenting that obtained in a formal clinical trial of ex-
tended platelet storage.22 Furthermore, transfusion of
platelet units on Day 6 or 7 of storage, when in-dated
units were unavailable to meet pressing clinical needs,
demonstrated the clinical utility of platelets stored up to
7 days. This manuscript reports the first 2 years of our
experience of routine culture of platelet units.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedure for sampling and culturing
All units of platelets entering the transfusible inventory
but not issued before the morning of Day 2 were cultured.
All of these were WBC-reduced apheresis platelet units.
Approximately 90 percent were collected on-site; ap-
proximately 75 percent of these were collected using a
cell separator (Spectra LRS Turbo, Gambro BCT, Lake-
wood, CO), and the remainder were collected using an-
other cell separator (MCS+, Haemonetics, Braintree, MA).
The standard procedure for donor arm preparation be-
fore on-site collection included an iodophor and polyvi-
nyl pyrolidone scrub (0.75% iodine) for 30 seconds fol-
lowed by application and drying of a povidone iodine
solution (1% iodine). Units were held at 22 to 24C on a
flat-bed rotator in a monitored environment throughout
storage. Initially, units were discarded after reaching the
end of their usual 5-day dating period. Beginning ap-
proximately 6 months into the protocol, units were held
in quarantine after reaching midnight of Day 5 until they
were transfused or until the morning of Day 8 (when
subjected to in vitro analyses). All units were subjected to
visual examination before transfusion to ensure the
maintenance of swirling.
On the morning of Day 2 after collection, or, for units
collected by an external supplier, on receipt of the unit,
the unit was cultured in the transfusion service labora-
tory. The unit was mixed well by hand, and all of it was
transferred to a single bag (if the contents were being
stored between two bags). A 150-mL transfer pack (Fen-
wal, Baxter, Round Lake, IL) was attached by use of a
sterile connecting device (SCD312, Terumo, Elkton, MD),
and 5 to 10 grams (10 mL) of the unit were transferred to
the transfer pack. Following separation of the transfer
pack by heat sealing, a sampling site coupler was inserted
into the sample bag, the septum of the needle access was
swabbed with an alcohol swab, and a 5- to 9-mL sample
was withdrawn from the transfer pack into a syringe us-
ing a 16- or 20-gauge needle. The cap of an aerobic blood
culture bottle (FA, bioMerieux, Durham, NC) was re-
moved and swabbed with a fresh alcohol swab. The con-
tents of the syringe were then transferred to the bottle
using the same needle used for sample aspiration. (This
bottle is intended to receive this volume [5-9 mL] of
blood for patient blood cultures.) The bottle was
promptly delivered to the Microbiology Laboratory (De-
partment of Pathology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
Center, Lebanon, NH) and incubated in an automated
bacterial detection system (BacT/Alert, bioMerieux) at 35
to 37C for up to 5 days or until growth was detected by
the system. If a report of growth was received while the
unit remained in inventory, the unit was immediately
quarantined and the unit recultured. If no report of
growth had been received by the time the unit was re-
leased for transfusion, approximately 5 mL were retained
in one of the two platelet storage bags of the unit to allow
reculture in case of a later report of growth from the Day
2 sampling. (This retention aliquot was added to the pro-
tocol approximately 6 months into the trial. We believed
this would help assess the specificity of the protocol.) The
organisms detected in positive cultures of platelet units
were identified using standard microbiologic techniques.
Our hypothesis was that growth of any bacteria
would be detected in the automated bacterial detection
system before they reached a clinically critical inoculum
in the unit. This was based on knowledge of growth
curves in platelet packs (80th percentile of detection, 48

hr)21,23 and that the platelet units were being held at a
temperature lower than the culture bottles. Therefore,
units were made available for transfusion at any time
they were needed clinically following labeling (usually on
Day 1).
Transfusion experience
In-date platelet units meeting all standard criteria for re-
lease were issued to patients as needed. Culture results
were not sought before release of units. On occasion, the
inventory of suitable platelet units became depleted and
could not be replenished from either internal or external
sources (3 hr distant) before a definable clinical need for
transfusion. In such circumstances, the pathologist cov-
ering the transfusion service was contacted and, if clini-
cally appropriate, specifically authorized the issuance of
a Day-6 or Day-7 unit that continued to have no detect-
able bacterial growth in the automated bacterial detec-
tion system and if swirling was evident.
The platelet transfusion routine in this institution in-
cludes determination of a CCI 1 hour (10-60 min) after
transfusion to assess posttransfusion recovery whenever
possible.24,25 The CCI was calculated according to a stan-
dard formula using the following approximation of body
surface area: body surface area (in cm2) = (body mass in
kg)0.425  (height in cm)0.725  71.84.26 In addition, the
patient’s response to each transfusion using platelets
stored for 6 or 7 days was assessed.
In vitro analyses
Platelet units that remained available on the morning of
Day 8 (approx., 10-12 hr after passing midnight on Day 7
after collection) were examined by a trained, experienced
laboratory staff member to assess qualitatively the pres-
ence or absence of swirling. A sample was taken for de-
termination of pH measured at 37C (Model 855, Bayer,
Norwood, MA).
RESULTS
During the first 24 months of this protocol, 2678 units of
WBC-reduced apheresis platelets were cultured. Of these,
16 (0.6%) grew bacteria (Table 1). Aliquots or the units
themselves were available to reculture in 13 cases. All of
these repeat cultures were negative despite the repeat
cultures occurring a day or more after the initial culture
(i.e., after additional time for any contaminating bacteria
to proliferate). Five of the units had been transfused be-
fore detection of bacterial growth in the initial samples.
The patients’ physicians were notified, and blood cul-
tures were collected from the patients, all of which were
negative. The patients had no unusual symptomatology
associated with these transfusions as determined by
chart review and interviews. Aliquots had been reserved
and remained available for reculture in three of these
cases; all of these follow-up cultures were negative.
Incidents of bacterial growth appeared to cluster
around the introduction of new laboratory personnel to
the culturing protocol. Despite careful training of staff
before beginning to perform the steps of the protocol,
documentation of competency in its techniques, and ad-
herence to a written standard operating procedure, con-
taminated samples in the first week or two of new staff
taking responsibility for this aspect of laboratory opera-
tions were not uncommon. Additional training resulted
in a reduction of aliquots contaminated in the process of
sample collection.

CULTURING OF APHERESIS PLATELET UNITS

The culturing protocol was continued after the
2-year study period. In the subsequent 6 months, two
units (split from the same apheresis collection by an ex-
ternal supplier) grew coagulase-negative Staphylococci
within 12 hours of culture on Day 2. Repeat culture of one
of the units confirmed this finding.
During the 2-year study period, six febrile transfu-
sion reactions following platelet transfusions (0.2% of
transfused units) were reported. In one case, a tempera-
ture rise of 2C or more was noted, but neither blood
culture of the patient nor repeat culture of a retained
aliquot of the unit was positive. None of these cases had
other clinical evidence suggestive of bacterial contami-
nation as the cause of the fever following transfusion.
Ninety-one units collected with the Spectra LRS were
available for further testing on the morning of Day 8.
Swirling was detected in 87 units (96%). The pH of these
units was 6.86 ( 0.245) (measured at 37C) and was
above 6.20 (6.30 at 22C) in 88 (97%). (One unit that had
no detectable swirling had a pH > 6.20.) The highest pH
recorded was 7.26 (7.47 at 22C). Fewer units collected on
the MCS+ were available for study, but the results of ana-
lyzing them on Day 8 were similar (data not shown).
Because of periodic inventory shortages and the dis-
tance to external suppliers, 40 transfusions using Spectra
LRS units stored for 6 or 7 days were given to patients
who required platelets without delay. All of these ap-
peared to yield expected clinical results. In 21 of these
transfusions, the patient’s clinical condition allowed
evaluation of CCIs measured 10 to 60 minutes after trans-
fusion. These Day-6- and Day-7-units yielded a CCI of
14,400  8800 (median, 12,191); 90 percent of the CCIs
were above 7500, and all but one was above 5000 (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
Our experience with routine culturing of platelet units
demonstrates that this protocol is practical in an Ameri-
can tertiary care medical center and can contribute to the
improvement of transfusion recipient safety. Although no
units could be confirmed to contain bacteria during the
initial 2-year study period, the discovery of a bacterially
contaminated collection shortly thereafter places the
contamination rate we encountered at approximately 1
per 3000 units, a rate commonly quoted in the litera-
ture.27
We interpret the first 16 occurences of initial culture
positivity during the 2-year study period as most likely
representing false-positive results, that is, introduction of
bacteria that were not present in the unit during the sam-
pling process. The 13 cases in which a reserved aliquot
was culture-negative on subsequent culture reinforces
this contention. The finding of the same bacterium in the
two parts of a split “double” plateletpheresis collection
shortly after the study period ended would appear to be
a documented case of contamination occuring around
the time of collection.
Five units had been transfused by the time that bac-
terial growth had been detected. None of the patients
appeared to acquire an infection as a result of the trans-
fusion, and reculture of the aliquots reserved from three
of these units revealed no growth. These three units
would appear not to have been contaminated. The true
status of the two other units (without reserved aliquots
available for reculturing) that were positive on initial cul-
ture but already transfused without incident cannot be
determined.
The clinical risks associated with bacterially con-
taminated platelet units presumably increase with the
length of storage of the platelet unit and the additional
time allowed for bacterial proliferation. After develop-
ments in bag technology allowed the FDA to extend the
storage period for platelets from 3 to 5 and ultimately 7
days, the agency noted an increase in the number of re-
ports of bacterially contaminated platelet units.28 The
FDA subsequently reduced the dating
period from 7 to 5 days to limit the time
during which bacterial proliferation
could occur before transfusion. The im-
portance of the time over which the
unit was being held at room tempera-
ture was highlighted by Morrow et al.29
who noted that although less than 10
percent of their institution’s platelet
transfusions occured on Day 5 of stor-
age, these transfusions accounted for
57 percent of septic reactions. In the
preliminary report of the Bacterial Con-
tamination (BaCon) study coordinated
through the CDC, all platelet units im-
plicated in clinically apparent septic re-
actions had been stored for 4 or 5
days.30

Our experience corroborates the European practice
in using an automated culturing system to detect bacteria
and to extend the storage period of platelet units.18,31
However, the culture protocol used in our laboratory has
not been validated as capable of detecting all instances of
bacterial contamination. Kinetic studies in plateletpher-
esis units inoculated with commonly encountered organ-
isms to 1 CFU per mL and then subjected to repetitive
5-mL automated cultures illustrated that cultures were
100 percent sensitive beginning on Day 2 of storage.12 A
similar study using a variety of organisms reported
growth in all but one sample (sensitivity >99%) when cul-
tures were taken at this point.21 An earlier study of the
growth curves of a variety of organisms inoculated into
platelet units validates that culture of a small aliquot on
Day 2 is sufficient to detect bacteria if present.23 How-
ever, it is recognized that some slower-growing organ-
isms, such as some Staphylococcus epidermidis, may not
be detected rapidly in an automated culture system.21
Validation of the sensitivity of this protocol, however,
might necessitate culturing units twice (once early in
storage and again at a later time) to ensure detection of
low inoculum in the unit. (This second culture point per-
haps might be at unit expiration, Day 5 or Day 7, or at
least 24 hr after the initial sampling, a time at which the
growth of any initial inoculum to a detectable level could
be reasonably assured.) Even assuming a contamination
rate of 1 per 3000, over 11,000 units would have to be
cultured to ensure (with 80% power and 95% CI) that the
protocol was detecting a sufficient proportion of truly
contaminated units so that extension of the storage pe-
riod would not decrease the bacteriologic safety of recipi-
ents. Recruitment of centers to participate in such a pro-
tocol (or sponsors of it) would be daunting. Nevertheless,
the value of routine culturing may be inferred from this
report and the publications detailing the European expe-
rience.
The report of culture positivity after transfusion for
one-quarter of the platelet units showing initial positivity
might be regarded as diminishing the clinical utility of
this protocol. However, results from repeat cultures or
the clinical situation suggest that all of these were not
true-positive cultures. Even in cases of true contamina-
tion, the bacteria are likely to grow more rapidly in the
(warmer) culture environment than in the unit itself, and
detection in the culture bottle would appear likely before
the inoculum in the bag reached a critical level. The units
with documented bacterial contamination were detected
by automated culture in only 12 hours.
Because the storage time for platelets is shorter than
for any other component, more platelets outdate than
any other type of component; implementation of a sys-
tem to reduce the chance of transfusing a bacterially con-
taminated unit could reduce platelet unit outdating
through increased storage time. In 1994, for example,
18 percent of platelets were reporting as outdated.32
This contrasts with much lower outdate rates (<5%) seen
during the period when platelets could be stored for
7 days.33,34 Because almost two-thirds of platelet trans-
fusions are now given as plateletpheresis components
at a cost of approximately $500 per preparation, this
outdating incurs a substantial cost in the healthcare
system and reduces the availability of platelets signifi-
cantly.35 The ability to extend the outdate, such as to
7 days, would make an important contribution to health-
care efficiency and platelet availability. Several European
centers have begun using this approach to ensure sterility
of platelet units and reap the benefit of extended shelf
life.17,18,31 We previously reported that our (variable)
costs for this culture protocol (excluding only those
costs related to the capital expense of the automated cul-
ture cabinet) was $16.50 per unit.36 The projected outdate
rate today with 7-day storage of platelets is difficult to
estimate because production, component type distribu-
tion, and logistics have all changed since the change of
platelet storage from 7 to 5 days 18 years ago. However,
even a modest reduction in outdating would be expected
to provide an economic advantage to the blood supply
system while improving patient safety with respect to
bacterial risks. Additional savings might be achieved if
such a bacterial detection technique were viewed as sup-
porting prestorage pooling of platelet units (as is com-
monly performed in European centers). This would sim-
plify handling of platelets for hospital transfusion
services and permit use of a single filter to be applied for
prestorage WBC reduction of platelets derived from
whole blood.
Applying this culture approach more broadly across
the US blood banking system remains a challenge. In
situations where hospitals hold platelet units only for
short periods before their transfusion, the culture would
need to be performed at the blood center. This would
necessitate several changes in current systems. First, a
reliable system to notify hospitals of a positive culture
result would need to be established to interdict the trans-
fusion of a distributed, bacterially contaminated unit.
Several European centers have created computerized
alert systems to accomplish this task, and many US blood
centers created just such a system when NAT was imple-
mented without a requirement that these test results be
available before distribution of the units. More signifi-
cant, perhaps, would be the alteration of the mindset of
blood suppliers to accept that bacterial test results were
still pending when releasing platelet units to hospitals.
Although 7-day storage of platelets has previously
been shown to provide viable, functional platelets, exten-
sion of the storage period to 7 days will require validation
that the current systems for collecting, processing, and
storing platelet units provide adequate clinical effi-
cacy.37-41 The results of our experience, that took advan-

tage of our unique location and platelet supply logistics,
support such an extension. The pH results after extended
storage indicated that almost all of the units held through
7 days of storage were likely to contain platelets that were
viable and functional. The transfusion of units beyond 5
days of storage resulted in CCIs that were clearly ad-
equate to support patient hemotherapy needs, and al-
most all (90%) were above the usual definition of a “suc-
cessful” transfusion increment.42 These transfusion
results in patients bolster the contention based on clini-
cal trials in this laboratory and elsewhere that platelets
can be stored for 7 days and retain clinical efficacy that is
indistinguishable from that of those stored for 5 days de-
spite the documented diminution of functionality, recov-
ery, and survival.22,43 This assertion is also a logical ex-
trapolation of previous experience that although there is
undoubtedly the accumulation of a functional lesion as-
sociated with increasing storage time of platelets, this is
not clinically distinguishable when transfusing platelets
of various storage ages.44 Concern has also been ex-
pressed that, with the advent of WBC reduction of plate-
let units, removal of WBCs would greatly reduce oxygen
consumption and allow the pH to rise dramatically dur-
ing storage, injuring the platelets as readily as a fall in pH
would.45,46 Changes in anticoagulant ratios with apher-
esis collections have undoubtedly changed initial levels
of acidity in platelet units as well. We found no instances
of pH elevation to or beyond physiologic levels in the 91
units of WBC-reduced platelets tested on Day 8, and el-
evation of pH to levels that would truly be injurious to
platelets (>7.6 using some types of agitators) seems un-
likely.22,47
Our experience is shared in the hope of encouraging
others to develop and implement similar protocols to im-
prove safety for platelet transfusion recipients. In combi-
nation with clinical trials demonstrating adequate func-
tionality, recovery, and survival of platelets stored for 7
days, we hope that experiences such as ours will embol-
den regulatory authorities to extend the storage time for
platelets in conjunction with use of a bacterial detection
system and thus allow improvement of patient safety
with minimization—or complete avoidance—of addi-
tional expense.
