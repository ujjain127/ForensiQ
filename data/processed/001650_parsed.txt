What I will cover: 
 Major Components 
 Focus: Great American Woodstove Changeout 
 Progress to date 
What Is EPA’s Voluntary Residential  
Wood Smoke Reduction Initiative? 
Major components 
 Great American Woodstove Changeout Campaign 
(Main focus) 
 “Burn Clean” National Education and Outreach 
Campaign 
 Supporting Efforts to Address Emissions from 
Fireplaces and Outdoor Wood Boilers 
What is a Woodstove Changeout  
Campaign? 
 A voluntary, incentive-based (cash rebates) effort 
to encourage owners of old, inefficient woodstoves 
to replace or “changeout” their stove with a 
cleaner burning hearth appliance, 
like: 
 Gas stoves 
 Wood pellet stoves 
 EPA-Certified wood stoves

Woodstove Changeouts: 
The Opportunity… 
 10 million stoves in use, 7.5 million old stoves 
 Cleaner burning, more efficient technologies available 
 Can measure the benefits, <$2,000/ton of PM2.5 
Graphic adapted from California EPA publication. *EPA is 
planning to conduct further research on pre-NSPS woodstove 
emission estimates. As such, these emission estimates may change.

4 Elements of the National  
Woodstove Changeout Campaign: 
 Raise awareness/focusing national attention 
 Implementing Pilots (Libby, MT & SW PA) 
 Develop partnerships/fostering collaboration 
 ALA, DOE, HUD, Chimney Sweeps, Home Inspectors 
 Target specific areas/being opportunistic 
 PM2.5 non-attainment, funding availability 
 Provide tools to help S/L/T begin programs 
 Outreach materials, funding options, health/cost benefits info 
Progress to date – Woodstove  
changeout pilots 
 Libby, MT kick-off (June, 05) 
 Goal: Replace 1200 stoves by 2007 
 $1 Million donated by industry, $100K from EPA, $50K state 
 $1 Million Congressional earmark 
 Phase I, low-income ~150 stoves installed 
 Phase II, 470 applications received to date 
 SW Pa kick-off (Sept., 05) 
 $100K EPA grant to help fund changeouts for low income 
 $80K from Allegheny County 
 $470M in health benefits if all 30,000 old stoves were changed out 
Progress to date – Supplemental  
Environmental Projects 
Several enforcement agreements negotiated 
to pay for clean stoves: Total ~ $700K 
 2 in Washington State: Bellingham ~$200K 
 2 in Ohio: Dayton ~$75K, Marietta ~245K 
 1 in VA: Christiansburg ~$45K 
 1 in NM: Questa ~$100K

Growing the Initiative:  
What is EPA doing? 
 EPA Demonstration Grants (FY 06): 
 Hope to have funds available for demonstrations 
in 2-3 locations 
Growing the Initiative:  
What is EPA doing? 
 Enforcement Settlement Agreement Funds: 
 Marketing woodstove changeout as a cost 
effective tool for addressing PM2.5 and toxics 
emissions to regulators (6 settlements so far) 
 If we can demonstrate cost effectiveness and 
easy to do, potential for large $ 
 (e.g., Toyota $20 million for diesel retrofits) 
Growing the Initiative:  
What is EPA doing? 
Develop new incentive ideas with stakeholders aimed at 
programmatic solutions for removing wood stoves. 
 Home inspectors/realtors (safety) 
 Utilities (Duke, Progress energy, Bonneville Power, TVA) 
 HUD, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Tribes 
 DOE Low-income Weatherization Program perfect fit for 
receiving settlement agreement and other funds 
Residential Wood Smoke Reduction  
Initiative 
Other components include: 
 National Education and Outreach Campaign – Partnership with 
HPBA, American Lung Association is critical 
 Voluntary Fireplace Consensus Test Method and National 
Building Code 
 Voluntary Outdoor Wood-fired Hydronic Heaters Consensus 
Test Method 
 At this time we do not plan to revise the woodstove NSPS 
Summary/Feedback 
 There is a great deal of energy and support inside and outside 
EPA 
 There are many facets and opportunities to the initiative 
 We look forward in supporting and working with S/L/Ts in
