O North Carolina is a net exporter of  solid 
waste. Much of it going to Virginia and South 
Carolina.
O In 1997, the Supreme Court determined that 
garbage was a commodity that could be 
traded across state lines.
O Landfills are becomely increasingly difficult to 
site and expensive to construct.
O Landfill operators have the right to reject 
any waste for disposal in their landfill, even if 
state regulations allow landfill disposal of such 
wastes.
O Modern day landfills are not dumps. 
O Highly regulated and highly engineered, ongoing  
construction projects for the life of the landfill.
O No scavenging is ever allowed.
O All wastes are required to be covered  with soil at end of 
the work day.
Medical Waste

Medical waste means any solid waste 
which is generated in the diagnosis, 
treatment, or  immunization of human 
beings or animals.

Regulated Medical Waste
Regulated Medical Waste
O Regulated medical waste means blood 
and body fluids in individual containers 
in volumes greater than 20 ml (about 
the size of a test tube), microbiological 
waste, and pathological waste .
O Roughly 9 percent to 15 percent of the 
waste stream at hospitals is regulated 
medical waste.
O Regulated medical waste must be 
treated prior to disposal.
Blood and Body Fluids
Blood and Body Fluids
O Blood and body fluids means liquid 
blood, serum, plasma, other blood 
products, emulsified human tissue, 
spinal fluids and pleural and peritoneal 
fluids. 
O Dialysates, urine, and feces are not
blood or body fluids under this 
definition.
O Preferred method of treatment- dispose 
of in a commode.
Microbiological Waste
Microbiological Waste
O Microbiological waste means cultures 
and stocks of infectious agents, 
including, but not limited to, specimens 
from medical, pathological, 
pharmaceutical, research, commercial 
and industrial laboratories.
O Can be autoclaved, incinerated, or 
treated with disinfectant chemicals 
(bleach 1:5).
Pathological Waste
Pathological Waste
O Pathological waste means human 
tissues, organs and body parts; and the 
carcasses of animals that were known
to have been exposed to pathogens or 
that died of a known or suspected 
disease transmissible to humans.
O Only method of treatment- incineration
(and other approved methods).
Disposal of Sharps
Disposal of Sharps
O The rules do not require treatment of 
sharps before disposal. 
O They must be packaged in a container 
that is rigid, leak-proof when in an 
upright position and puncture resistant.
O The package then may be disposed of 
with general solid waste.

Not Defined as RMW in NC
O Medical waste such as  dressings and 
bandages (even when blood soaked), 
sponges,disposable instruments, used 
gloves, and tubing.
O These items are not included in the 
definition of regulated medical waste 
and may be disposed of without 
treatment in the general solid waste 
stream.
O Many generators choose to ship and 
incinerate non-regulated medical waste 
such as gloves, bloody bandages, 
dressings, and tubing.
O Household waste (home injectors) is not 
included in the definition of medical 
waste and is not subject to the medical 
waste management rules.
O Household garbage has on average 100 
times more pathogenic microorganisms 
than general medical waste.
O Generators are responsible for ensuring 
that waste is disposed of properly.
O There is a  "50 Pound per Month" 
record-keeping exemption for small 
generators.
O Some facilities, such as long-term care 
facilities, generate medical waste but 
little or no regulated medical waste.
O Hospitals are only 3% of generators, but 
account for 70% of medical waste.
O Alternative medical waste treatment 
technologies are listed on the website: 
wastenotnc.org/programs/medical
OSHA
O OSHA specifies certain features of the 
regulated waste containers, including
appropriate tagging. This is meant to 
protect waste industry workers.
O OSHA definition of regulated waste is not 
intended to designate waste that must be 
incinerated or otherwise treated before 
landfilling. Does not address disposal.
O OSHA - definition of regulated waste may 
include waste such as bloody gauze, blood 
saturated dressings, used gloves, or 
tubing. 
O US EPA does not regulate medical 
waste in North Carolina.
O North Carolina does not require that 
sharps be incinerated.
O North Carolina does not prohibit 
landfilling of items that contacted blood 
and body fluids (trauma scenes).
O Transport of regulated medical waste 
must comply with US Dept. of 
Transportation and NC Waste 
Management rules.
O North Carolina does not require cradle to 
grave tracking of medical waste.
This means we do not know who the 
generators and transporters are. Contact a 
regulated waste treatment provider to find a 
transporter.
O Waste Management regulates (permits 
and inspects) commercial medical waste 
treatment providers.
Reduce and Reuse...
Reduce and Reuse...
O Eliminate unused items from custom 
surgical packs (once pack is opened, 
unused items are discarded).
O Identify items that are not used regularly 
enough to justify inclusion in various 
packs.
O Tell manufacturer when one outdate 
item causes entire pack to be outdated 
(e.g. tetracaine in spinal tray).
O Estimated cost savings $30,000/yr
O Est. waste prevention: 11,000 lbs/yr
O Purchase washable  surgical and 
isolation gowns, and sterilization trays.
O Convert surgical drapes into biopsy 
cloths.
O Consider switching to reusable medical 
instruments (e.g. stainless steel trays 
and laparoscopic instruments).
O Sanitize and reuse plastic fracture pans.
O Sanitize and reuse graduated 
measuring containers.
O Estimated cost savings: $60,000/yr
O Est. waste prevention: 50,000 lbs/yr
O Determine if cloth towels can be reused 
and later sold as rags.
O Use cloth diapers.
O Use worn diapers as cleaning rags.
O Contract with haulers of RMW to 
provide reusable containers for “red 
bag” wastes and sharps.
O Estimated cost savings: $200,000/yr
O Est. waste prevention: 230,000 lbs/yr

RECYCLE
RECYCLE
O Organizations exist that recycle unused 
medical supplies- ace bandages to 
sutures.
O Accept used but working medical 
equipment - autoclaves to wheelchairs.
O REMEDY - find a link at our website.
O HERO - Healthcare Equipment and 
Recycling Organization at 
greennature.com
O Supplies and equipment donated to 
national and international charities.
Benefits of Recycling
Benefits of Recycling
O Unused medical supplies are diverted to 
needy charities around the world. REMEDY 
attorneys can help resolve liability issues.
O Hospitals save money on waste that does not 
need to be treated and taken to the landfill.
O Valuable landfill space is preserved.
Incinerators are regulated by three DENR 
divisions:
1) Division of Waste Management
Solid waste - due to ash. Ash is tested and if found 
to be high in hazardous materials then it is 
disposed of at hazardous waste landfill.
2) Division of Water Quality
Water Quality - due to water that is  used to 
quench ash. It is taken to waste water treatment 
plant.
3) Division of Air Quality
Air Quality - due to effluent from  the smokestack.
O The cost of treating medical waste that 
does not require treatment adds to the 
cost of healthcare. 
O 1.75 cents/lb. vs 55 cents/lb.
O Waste reduction strategies preserve  
valuable landfill space and save  money.
