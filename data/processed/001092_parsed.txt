EDUCATION 
-Ph.D. 2002, Oceanography. ìBiogeochemistry of the mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs): A new 
perspective on UV-absorbing compounds via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.î University of 
Washington with Dr. John I. Hedges (deceased). 
-M.S. 1996, ìDistribution of mycosporine-like amino acids in particulate and dissolved organic matter 
pools.î with Dr. Maria Vernet (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) and Dr. Nigel Crawford (UCSD). 
-B.S. 1995, Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego. 
RESEARCH INTERESTS 
•  
Understanding the effects of UV radiation on the physiology, ecology and biogeochemistry of 
aquatic systems, especially those undergoing current changes in UV flux such as Polar Regions.  
•  
Understanding the cellular mechanisms employed by autotrophic organisms for protection from 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation principally via the use of sunscreen compounds, the production of 
antioxidants or the implementation of cellular repair mechanisms. 
•  
Development an implementation of innovative new analytical approaches, with a focus utilizing mass 
spectral techniques such as proteomics and applying new genomic techniques.
