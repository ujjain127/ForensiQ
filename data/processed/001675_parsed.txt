W
ithin the past decade medication errors have
emerged as a significant patient safety concern
and have been shown to account for up to
7,000 deaths per year.
1 One intervention aimed at reduc-
ing the incidence of medication errors is improving writ-
ten or electronic communications, particularly in patient
medical charts. In 2004 The Joint Commission intro-
duced the “Do Not Use” list of abbreviations2 as part of
the requirements for meeting National Patient Safety Goal
2, which addresses the effectiveness of communication
among caregivers. Goal 2B requires health care organiza-
tions to maintain a standardized list of abbreviations,
acronyms, and symbols that are not to be used.3
In addition to the “Do Not Use” list, the organization
is required to develop additional restrictions pertaining to
the use of abbreviations. In May 2005, the Joint Commis-
sion’s required “Do Not Use” list was reaffirmed4,5 (Table 1,
page 578). Despite the list’s availability since 2004, non-
compliance remains a frequent finding (23%) during Joint
Commission surveys. Furthermore, annual Joint Commis-
sion survey results have shown a decreasing trend (from
75.2% to 64.2%) in compliance in hospitals from 2004 to
2006.6
Communication failures are the most common root
cause of sentinel events, accounting for more than 60% of
events from 2002 through 2006.7 Frequently, communica-
tion lapses are the result of using abbreviations when con-
veying medication orders. Staff responsible for reading,
interpretation, and processing medication orders may not
recognize or may misconstrue an abbreviation, resulting in
the alteration of the intended meaning. An example com-
monly reported is the misinterpretation of the letter “U”
intended to represent the word “units” being frequently
interpreted as a 0 (that is, “10U” is misread as “100”
units). If not caught, this error would likely result in the
administration of an inappropriate dose, potentially harm-
ing patients.8 To our knowledge, however, the deleterious
effect of using abbreviations has not been previously quan-
tified. The purpose of this study was to provide further
evidence about patient safety risks that result from using
abbreviations.
The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) MEDMARX®
program is a national medication error reporting program
that allows subscribing facilities (hospitals and their relat-
ed health systems) to report and track medication errors in
a standardized format. MEDMARX uses the National
Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting
and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for Categorizing
Medication Errors to measure error outcomes, in which
Categories E through I indicate patient harm.9,10 The valid-
ity of this instrument was recently reaffirmed.11 The char-
acteristics and impact of abbreviation use are summarized
and analyzed in this article on the basis of error records
submitted to MEDMARX between 2004 and 2006.

identified and exported to a worksheet format. Machine
reading of the records was done using keywords (from the
“Do Not Use” list and previous USP publications12,13) in
filter mode. Figure 1 (above) outlines the methodology of
the study. The researchers also read any record that could
not be machine read, looking for evidence of any abbrevi-
ation that was involved in the errors. Any record that
could not be associated with a particular abbreviation was
discarded from the sample.  
Each record that remained in the final data set was eval-
uated, using the Index for Categorizing Medication
Errors, for the node (or phase in the medication use
process), the level of staff associated with making the error,
and the type of error that resulted. When records were
assessed for the types of error involved in the event, the
number of times a type of error was selected rather than
the number of records containing that error type was used
for calculations because each error record may have con-
tained more than one type of error. Errors were also exam-
ined by discipline (medicine, pharmacy, or nursing)
involved in the event. All data were analyzed using
descriptive statistics.
Findings 
SAMPLE
From 2004 through 2006 a total of 643,151 medication
errors were reported to the MEDMARX program from
682 facilities. Of these errors, 29,974 (4.7%) were attrib-
utable to abbreviation use.  Through machine and staff
reading, records were grouped into themes or discarded.
Approximately 39.4% (n = 11,821) of the abbreviation
errors were excluded due to lack of information provided
from the reporter in the error description to allow classifi-
cation of the abbreviation. The final sample size consisted
of 18,153 medication error reports. These reports were
distributed into the appropriate recurring themes, here-
after referred to as abbreviation groups. 
The primary variables measured included (1) volume or

ABBREVIATION GROUPS
The frequency of abbreviation groups involved in med-
ication errors is summarized in Table 2 (page 579). The
most common abbreviation resulting in a medication error
was the use of “QD” in place of “once daily,” accounting
for 43.1% of all errors, followed by “U” for units (13.1%),
“cc” for “mL” (12.6%), “MSO4” or “MS” for “morphine
sulfate” (9.7%), and decimal errors (3.7%). Drug name
abbreviations other than MSO4 (morphine sulfate) or
MgSO4 (magnesium sulfate) were represented by the
abbreviation group “drug name.” Abbreviations for drug
names using the stem (for example, nitro = nitroglycerin)
were placed in the abbreviation group “stem.”
ERROR OUTCOME
The majority of errors were associated with an NCC
MERP categorization of A, B, or C (28%, 67.2%, and
3.8%, respectively). Using the sample size available for
evaluation as the denominator (n = 18,153); 0.3% of
errors resulted in patient harm (NCC MERP Categories E
through I). The most common abbreviations resulting in
patient harm are summarized in Table 3 (page 580).
NODE WHERE ERROR ORIGINATED
Eighty-one percent of the errors occurred at the pre-
scribing node of the medication process, while errors
occurring at the transcribing and dispensing nodes
occurred with much less frequency, representing only 14%
and 2.9% of errors, respectively. Administration, monitor-
ing, and procurement combined represented less than 2%
of errors.  
STAFF INVOLVED
Abbreviation errors originated more often from 
medical staff (78.5%) in comparison to nursing (15.1%),
pharmacy (4.2%), other health care providers (1.3%), 
and non–health care providers (0.9%). As shown in Table
4 (page 581), the abbreviations with the greatest incidence
differed among staff. For example, the top abbreviation
errors among medical staff were “sc” (90.4%; 319/353
occurrences), “HS” (87.8%; 424/483), and “cc” (83.7%;
1705/2036), while the top abbreviations among nursing
staff were “IU” (46.2%; 6/13), “stem”drug names,
(29.4%; 5/17 incidents), and “TID” (27.8%; 20/72). The
use of “BID” (21.2%; 35/165), “µg” (20.9%; 14/67
occurrences), and “d/c” (20.3%; 25/123) were identified
as the abbreviation errors with the greatest incidence with-
in the pharmacy staff.

TYPES OF ERROR
Errors involving abbreviations were also examined by
the types of error associated with the event. A total of
19,048 error type selections were reported in 18,153
records and sorted to their respective abbreviation groups.
Overall, the three most common types of error resulting
from abbreviation use were prescribing (67.5%), improp-
er dose/quantity (20.7%), and incorrectly prepared med-
ication (3.9%). When evaluating the frequency of types of
error by the five most frequently reported abbreviations
(QD, u, cc, MSO4 or MS, and decimal—the inappropri-
ate use of leading or trailing zeros), the error-type inci-
dence was very similar, with prescribing (68.8%) as the
most common type of error, followed by improper
dose/quantity (21.9%) and incorrectly prepared medica-
tion (3.5%). Furthermore, if the top five abbreviations
were removed from the data pool (decreasing the data pool
to n = 3474), the incidence of error type would still be
greatest among prescribing (61.8%) and improper dose
quantity (15.4%).
Abbreviations and
Miscommunication: Case Examples 
CASE 1
A 62-year-old patient on hemodialysis was treated for a
viral infection with acyclovir. The order for acyclovir was
written as “acyclovir (unknown dose) with HD.” The order
was misinterpreted as TID (three times daily). Intravenous
acyclovir should be adjusted for renal impairment and
given after hemodialysis once daily. The patient received
three doses daily during a two-day period, resulting in a
rapid mental decline, delirium, and subsequent death.
CASE 2
A hydromorphone epidural was prescribed for a patient
and written as “2 µg/mL.” The pharmacist incorrectly
entered the order as “500 mg in 250 mL” and prepared
and labeled the medication as “2 mg/mL.” The error was
perpetuated when the nurse incorrectly interpreted the
labeled medication and administered a 1,000-fold dose
variance. The patient developed marked respiratory
depression requiring intubation and mechanical ventila-
tion, in addition to compromised cardiac function requir-
ing chest compressions and pharmacological intervention.
The epidural was removed and naloxone was administered
as a continuous infusion to antagonize the effects.
CASE 3
A 53-year old male patient whose chief complaint was
mid-sternal chest pain was evaluated by a cardiologist. On
evaluation the physician believed that the pain was not
cardiac in nature, but rather of gastrointestinal origin. An
order for “MDX/GI” cocktail was written. Pharmacy pre-
pared the compound, which is composed of Mylanta®
(aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and sime-
thicone), diclomine, and Xylocaine® (lidocaine). On
administration, the patient experienced difficulty breath-
ing, followed by respiratory distress. A code was called and

Discussion
Medication errors are often associated with illegible hand-
writing of orders, which often include abbreviations. With
the increased adoption of information technology, the use
of abbreviations in drug data libraries and computer-entry
screens will continue to pose a threat to patient safety. The
results of this study provide further evidence that abbrevi-
ation use remains prevalent and can result in patient harm
despite the introduction of the National Patient Safety
Goal to improve communication and restrict the use of
abbreviations. Few studies have quantified the extent of
such errors in terms of volume or error severity. Since the
adoption of The Joint Commission list of prohibited
abbreviations, it appears that awareness has led to
increased reporting of medication errors stemming from
abbreviation use. In addition, the reporting of abbrevia-
tions as a cause of medication errors before the introduc-
tion of the Joint Commission National Patient Safety
Goals in 2002 represented 1% of all reported medication
errors, compared with an average of 4.5% since (2003-
2006).14 Continued reporting of errors associated with
abbreviations is critical in the identification of error-prone
practices and the improvement of patient safety.
Although the incidence of patient harm is low, any inci-
dence which can be avoided is a target toward which
everyone should strive. A simple risk-versus-benefit analy-
sis of abbreviation use versus prohibition will reveal that
whereas using abbreviations may
save minutes, prohibiting abbrevia-
tions may save lives. 
Abbreviation errors originated
at the prescribing node more often
than all other nodes combined.
One may argue that errors origi-
nating at this node are less prob-
lematic because the pathway
between prescribing and patient
receipt of the order is designed to
intercept errors; however, they do
present unnecessary risk. Funda-
mentally, removal of the originating causes of the error
(that is, abbreviations) is more sensible than relying on
quality control measures to intercept the error before it
reaches the patient.
A study performed by Bates et al.15 revealed that
approximately 30% of all handwritten prescriptions
required clarification and correction by a pharmacist to
prevent an error. Pharmacy and nursing are often charged
with contacting the prescriber when abbreviations con-
found orders. This often causes conflict between the
health care professions, further deteriorating communica-
tion. Potential solutions to this dilemma include engage-
ment of medical staff leadership, accountability for
habitual offenders, rewards for nonusage, and education.  
The identification of which staff members contribute
to the medication errors associated with individual abbre-
viations highlights areas for further staff development.
Education targeted at illustrating the dangers of abbrevia-
tion use is essential. If data and illustrative case reports
(perhaps organization-specific) are presented, awareness of
the perils of abbreviation use will be heightened.
Identifying by discipline the most common abbreviations
that resulted in errors may be of value for designing inter-
ventions aimed at various health professionals. For exam-
ple, physician education initiatives should include limiting
the use of “sc,” “hs,” and “cc”—the most common infrac-
tions. A similar approach may be taken for pharmacy and
nursing.  
Education is often not enough; enforcement is required
to ensure that abbreviations are not used.16 This may be
done by holding health care professionals accountable for
infractions. Medical staff leadership must be engaged to

exert peer pressure and support for the policy. Likewise, an
endorsement from the pharmacy and therapeutics com-
mittee may also be a good source for awareness and
enforcement policy for pharmacy departments. Senior
nursing leaders share a similar responsibility for eliminat-
ing the use of inappropriate abbreviations by nursing staff.
Peer-initiated programs tend to have better staff accept-
ance. Therefore, the identification of key leadership figures
respective to each discipline responsible for implementing
peer accountability is a crucial element for success.
Several negative outcomes may develop as a result of
lapses in communication originating from commonly
used, error-prone abbreviations. For example, prescribing
errors have the propensity to be perpetuated and result in
patient harm when abbreviated drug names are confused
with other products, scheduling instructions are unclear,
or units of measure are ambiguous. Improper dosages that
are excessive may lead to medication toxicity. Conversely,
improper dosages that underdose may lead to subthera-
peutic drug levels, which could contribute to increased
hospital stays, treatment failures, and in the case of antibi-
otics, drug resistance. Improper medication preparation
results in unnecessary drug expenditure and waste, in
addition to potentially exposing patients to unnecessary
pharmacologic agents.

data. Reporter bias or inexperience may have contributed
to conservative categorization of errors. This was seen par-
ticularly in the “U,” “MSO4,” and “MgSO4” groups
because reporters tended to be more conservative in
assigning the error to an NCC MERP Index category.
Furthermore, reporting may be biased to find only those
errors that are associated with abbreviations from The
Joint Commission’s “Do Not Use” abbreviation list, result-
ing in a higher ranking for those abbreviations than oth-
ers. In addition, the incidence of patient harm associated
with abbreviation use was based on a small sample size in
several of the top five abbreviations associated with patient
harm. Another limitation, which is discussed in greater
depth in the Conclusion and Recommendations, is the
large number of records (39.4%) excluded because of the
lack of error description and subsequent identification of
the error causing abbreviation. This decreased the viable
sample size and thus eliminated records with the potential
to identify additional error-prone abbreviations or to
strengthen data supporting prohibition of error-prone
abbreviations.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Nearly 5% of all errors reported to MEDMARX from
2004 through 2006 were attributable to abbreviations.
Armed with the understanding that communication is the
leading cause of sentinel events and that abbreviation use
hinders communication, limiting abbreviation use im-
proves patient safety and patient care. In addition, error-
prone abbreviations are preventable and therefore are a
logical area for improvement. Although the use of abbre-
viations may be more time efficient, it comes at the
expense of creating barriers to communication, which is
detrimental to patient safety. This study provides further
support to the “Do Not Use” list.
This analysis of nearly 30,000 medication error reports
involving abbreviations suggests that health care organiza-
tions should examine other additions to the “Do Not Use”
list. Some atypical abbreviations resulted in patient harm
and are worthy of consideration for inclusion in facility-
specific lists. Good candidates for incorporation into such
lists include drug name abbreviations (for example, PCN,
DCN, TCN), stem abbreviations (amps, nitro, succs), µg
(mcg), cc (mL), and dose scheduling (BID, TID, QID).*
As previously stated, 39.4% of the 29,794 errors in
which abbreviations were identified as the cause of error
could not be used in data analysis because of insufficient
error descriptions, meaning that the exact abbreviation
was unidentified. This is of concern because these data
have the potential to benefit clinical practice through illus-
tration of potential harm associated with these abbrevia-
tions. When reporting medication errors, it is essential for
the reporter to include the key points that adequately
■Initiate a campaign to eradicate the use of abbrevia-
tions in clinical practice; an interdisciplinary approach is
essential.
–Use “Dear Doctor” letters
–Post prohibited abbreviation lists on hospital 
identification badges, in patient charts, newsletters,
an intranet site, computer screen savers, and
announcement boards.
–Use peer-initiated accountability.
–Give rewards for non-usage.
■Educate staff on the harmful effects of abbreviations.
■Minimize the use of abbreviations; write out the drug
name, schedule, unit of measure.
–Prohibit use in patient charts, preprinted order
forms, computer programs.
■Clarify intent to avoid misinterpretation if abbreviations
are found.
■Introduce computerized physician order entry (CPOE)
in a manner that minimizes the use of abbreviations.
■Review all computer-entry software for potential 
abbreviation issues.
■Prohibit the use of abbreviations in all facility publica-
tions (e.g., newsletters).
