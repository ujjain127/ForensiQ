Generic Drugs
A generic drug is a copy of a brand 
name drug. It works the same as the 
brand name drug.
Are generic drugs safe? Yes.
•  The FDA requires that all drugs 
are safe and effective. Generic 
drugs use the same substances 
and work the same way in the 
body as brand name drugs. So 
they have the same risks and 
beneﬁts as the brand name drug.
Are they as strong as brand name 
drugs? Yes.
•  The FDA demands that generic 
drugs are just as strong, pure, and 
stable as brand name drugs. They 
must also be the same quality.
Will they take longer to work in my 
body? No.
•  Generics work in the same way 
and in the same amount of time as 
brand name drugs.
Why are they cheaper?
•  New drugs are developed under 
patents. A patent gives only that 
one company the right to sell the 
drug for a period of time. This 
protects those who create the 
drug and pay to research, develop, 
and market it.
•  Other companies can apply to the 
FDA to sell a generic when the 
patent is about to expire. Generic 
companies do not have the same 
up-front costs to research and 
develop the drug. They can sell 
their drug at a lower cost because 
their makers don’t have the costs 
of creating the new drug.
•  Also, once generic drugs are 
approved, there are more people 
trying to sell the drug. This keeps 
the price down.
•  Today, almost half of all 
prescriptions are ﬁlled with 
generic drugs.
Are brand-name drugs made in 
better factories? No.
•  Both brand name and generic 
drug factories must meet the 
same standards. The FDA will not 
let drugs be made in poor quality 
factories. The FDA inspects about 
3,500 factories a year to make 
sure they meet the standards. 
Often the same factories make 
both brand name and generic 
drugs.

TAKE TIME TO CARE... For yourself, for those who need you.
Why don’t the drugs look the 
same?
•  In the United States, laws do 
not allow a generic drug to look 
exactly like the brand name drug. 
A generic drug must use the same 
substances as brand name drugs. 
Colors, ﬂavors, and some other 
inactive parts may be different.
Does every brand name drug have 
a generic form? No.
•  Brand name drugs are protected 
by patent for 20 years. When 
the patent expires, other drug 
companies can create generics. 
But they must be tested by the 
maker and approved by the FDA.
