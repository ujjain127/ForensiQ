Appendix A:  Content Framework Summary Documents 
 
This appendix presents information about the NAEP 2003 and TIMSS 2003 
mathematics content frameworks used for item classifications at the expert panel meeting.   
 
Exhibit A-1 is the summary document that was used by the expert panel for the 
classification of items to the content strands, topics, and subtopics in the NAEP 2003 
mathematics framework. 
 
Exhibit A-2 is the summary document that was used by the expert panel for the 
classification of items to the content domains, topic areas, and objectives in the TIMSS 2003 
mathematics framework. 
 
These summary documents are based on the NAEP 2003 and TIMSS 2003 framework 
and assessment specifications documents, but have been reformatted and adapted slightly to 
facilitate the classification process.   
 
Framework summary documents were not prepared for PISA; expert panel content 
classifications based on the PISA framework were made only at the overarching idea level, and 
there are no topics or subtopics specified in the PISA framework.  For more information about 
the PISA framework, see OECD (2003).

or kilograms is the common usage at these levels. 
Countries in which mass is the common usage for 
grades 4 and/or 8 will frame items accordingly. 
1a: Select and use appropriate standard units to find 
measures of length, area, volume, perimeter, 
circumference, time, speed, density, angle,

* More properly mass, but weight expressed in 
grams or kilograms is the common usage at these 
levels. Countries in which mass is the common 
usage for grades 4 and/or 8 will frame items 
accordingly.

Appendix B:  Levels of Mathematical Complexity 
 
Exhibit B-1 is the document that was used by the expert panel for the mathematical complexity 
classifications.  The summary document is based on the prepublication version of the NAEP 2005 
framework that was available at the time of the expert panel meeting but has been reformatted and 
adapted slightly to facilitate the classification process. 
 
Exhibit B-1. Levels of mathematical complexity adapted from the NAEP 2005 mathematics 
framework 
 
Low Complexity 
Moderate Complexity 
High Complexity 
This category relies heavily on the 
recall and recognition of previously 
learned concepts and principles.  
Items typically specify what the 
student is to do, which is often to 
carry out some procedure that can be 
performed mechanically.  It is not 
left to the student to come up with an 
original method or solution.   
 
Items in the moderate-complexity 
category involve more flexibility of 
thinking and choice among 
alternatives than do those in the low-
complexity category.  They require a 
response that goes beyond the 
habitual, is not specified, and 
ordinarily has more than a single 
step.  The student is expected to 
decide what to do, using informal 
methods of reasoning and problem-
solving strategies, and to bring 
together skill and knowledge from 
various domains.   
High-complexity items make heavy 
demands on students, who must 
engage in more abstract reasoning, 
planning, analysis, judgment, and 
creative thought.  A satisfactory 
response to the item requires that the 
student think in an abstract and 
sophisticated way.   
 
The following are some, but not all, 
of the demands that items in the low-
complexity category might make: 
• 
Recall or recognize a fact, term, 
or property; 
• 
Recognize and example of a 
concept; 
• 
Compute a sum, difference, 
product, or quotient; 
• 
Recognize an equivalent 
representation; 
• 
Perform a specified procedure; 
• 
Evaluate an expression in an 
equation or formula for a given 
variable; 
• 
Solve a one-step word problem; 
• 
Draw or measure simple 
geometric figures; or 
• 
Retrieve information from a 
graph, table, or figure. 
 
The following illustrate some of the 
demands that items of moderate 
complexity might make: 
• Represent a situation 
mathematically in more than one 
way; 
• Select and use different 
representations, depending on 
situation and purpose; 
• Solve a word problem requiring 
multiple steps; 
• Compare figures or statements; 
• Provide a justification for steps in 
a solution process; 
• Interpret a visual representation; 
• Extend a pattern; 
• Retrieve information from a 
graph, table, or figure and use it 
to solve a problem requiring 
multiple steps; 
• Formulate a routine problem, 
given data and conditions; or 
• Interpret a simple argument. 
 
Items at the level of high complexity 
may ask the student to do any of the 
following: 
• Describe how different 
representations can be used for 
different purposes; 
• Perform a procedure having 
multiple steps and multiple 
decision points; 
• Analyze similarities and 
differences between procedures 
and concepts; 
• Generalize a pattern; 
• Formulate an original problem, 
given a situation; 
• Solve a novel problem; 
• Solve a problem in more than one 
way; 
• Explain and justify a solution to a 
problem; 
• Describe, compare, and contrast 
solution methods; 
• Formulate a mathematical model 
for a complex situation; 
• Analyze the assumptions made in 
a mathematical model; 
• Analyze or produce a deductive 
argument; or 
• Provide a mathematical 
justification.

Considerations in Selecting Classification Methods 
 
The cross-classification approach (classification of items in one assessment to the other 
assessment framework) was selected for the examination of content and grade match so that there 
would be multiple content profiles for each assessment.  This method also prevents each assessment 
from being evaluated through only one perspective, which may or may not be reflective of its 
purposes.  This approach takes advantage of the multiple ways of describing content found in the 
frameworks and enables direct comparisons across the assessments.   
 
For the classifications based on cognitive processes and skills, a common classification 
system was chosen—levels of mathematical complexity from the NAEP 2005 framework.  There 
were several reasons for deciding, first, to use only a single classification system and, second, for 
selecting this NAEP 2005 dimension for the common system.  With regard to the first decision, the 
study organizers recognized that classifications in these dimensions likely would require more 
discretionary judgment than those in content areas, and thought a single rubric would be the most 
realistic to implement under the time constraints.  With regard to the second decision, although all 
three 2003 mathematics assessment frameworks compared in this study include a dimension related 
to cognitive skills and processes, the classification system from the NAEP 2005 framework focuses 
on the characteristics of items rather than on inferred cognitive abilities of students, which may vary 
widely from student to student.  Furthermore, it is expected to be in use in NAEP for several years to 
come, making it a potentially valuable link to similar comparison studies in the future. 
 
Reliability Analyses 
 
 
For the classification of items, the expert panel was divided into three groups to review items 
by content area (as described in section 3).  To measure the extent to which the different content area 
groups were interpreting the common rubric in similar ways, a common set of items was classified by 
all three groups with respect to mathematical complexity level.  The degree to which the three groups 
classified these items in the same categories on this dimension serves as a measure of the reliability 
of these classifications.  The set of 60 items (30 from NAEP and 30 from TIMSS), which reflects 
approximately 9 percent of the total item classifications across both assessments, was taken from 
across the mathematics content areas and grade levels.  This was not a random sample, but a 
representative set chosen to cover the main categories addressed in the study (content area and grade 
level).  Some effort was also made to ensure that there were at least some items from each of the 
cognitive categories based on the original assessment developers’ classifications (cognitive domains 
in TIMSS and mathematical abilities in NAEP).  Reliability items were classified at regular intervals 
throughout the classification process.  Given the limited time available for the expert panel meeting, 
the 30 items from each assessment was the maximum number of items that could be included in the 
reliability set. 
 
The reliability set of 30 items from each assessment (NAEP and TIMSS) was composed of 
10 items from the number category and 5 items from each of measurement, geometry, data, and 
algebra.  This reflects 10 items from each of the three primary content groups into which the expert 
panel was divided (number, measurement/geometry, and data/algebra).  For the reliability results, 
each group contributed 10 classifications from their primary content areas and another 20 secondary 
classifications for reliability items from the other content areas.  Due to time constraints, one of the 
D-2 
three groups only provided secondary classifications for 5 of the 20 items outside their primary 
content area.  This group contributed primary classifications for items in data and algebra, and 5 
secondary classifications from the number category.  Therefore, the set of 15 items that have 
classifications from all three groups do not reflect any items from measurement and geometry; for 
those items, reliability data are based on only two classifications.  With respect to other item 
characteristics (e.g., grade level, item format, and NAEP mathematical ability category), the set is 
still balanced and representative of the full reliability set. 
 
The multiple classification data for the reliability set were analyzed based on the percentage 
of classifications where there was agreement.  Classification reliability statistics were computed in 
two ways, as follows: 
 
• 
The percentage of total comparisons: based on the number of comparisons where there was 
agreement between any two groups (i.e., groups 1 and 2, groups 2 and 3 and groups 1 and 3) 
across ALL items; and 
 
• 
The percentage of items: based on the number of items where there was agreement across 
ALL three groups. 
 
The results from these two types of analyses are shown in tables D-1 and D-2. 
 
The results of the reliability analyses shown in table D-1 (based on number of comparisons 
across any two groups) were checked to evaluate any impact of removing the 5 number and 10 
measurement/geometry NAEP items with data from only two groups.  The results showed no change 
in the reported percentage agreement (78 percent).  Thus, the full set of reliability data were used for 
the analyses shown. 
 
There was reasonably high agreement across groups on classification to the three levels of 
mathematical complexity (low, moderate, and high).  The results indicate 79 percent agreement for 
all comparisons between any two groups across all items (table D-1).  These results reflect agreement 
across all groups for 69 percent of all items (table D-2).  When broken down into the NAEP and 
TIMSS items, the results are similar.  For items where there was not total agreement across groups, 
disagreement was always to “adjacent” categories (i.e., low/moderate and moderate/high).  There 
were no instances of disagreement between low and high complexity.

NOTE: Data are based on 30 NAEP items and 30 TIMSS items that were classified by three expert panel groups and reflect all comparisons 
between any two groups (i.e., groups 1 and 2; groups 2 and 3; and groups 1 and 3).  One group classified only 15 of 30 NAEP items in the 
reliability set, meaning that agreement on the classification for 15 NAEP items was based on the classifications of two groups instead of three.  
This results in a total number of comparisons of 60 for NAEP items (instead of 90) and 150 overall.

NOTE: Data are based on 30 NAEP items and 30 TIMSS items that were classified by three expert panel groups and reflect comparisons across 
all three groups for each item.  One group classified only 15 of 30 NAEP items in the reliability set; the percentage agreement for NAEP items 
includes only the items that were classified by all three groups.

Progress (NAEP) 2003 Mathematics Assessment and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003 Assessment. 
 
In sum, the main focus of the present study is a content comparison—classification of items 
to the content framework of the other assessment—which was done by the separate content-area 
subpanels.  The reliability tables are included only to provide some indication of the extent to which 
the expert panelists agreed on the other metric that used a common rubric (mathematical complexity 
level).  Expert panelists typically spent less time reviewing and classifying the items in the reliability 
set that were outside of their primary content areas, and the results from these secondary 
classifications should not be viewed as a complete replication of the process used by the primary 
group which was most familiar with the items in the respective content areas.  Therefore, only the 
primary group classifications were used in the reporting of results for mathematical complexity level. 
 
Data Processing 
 
After the expert panel meeting, the facilitators of each group met to review the methods used 
and the data collected to ensure consistency.  In some cases, methods or reporting conventions were 
slightly different between groups.  For these cases, the facilitators reviewed their notes and the notes 
of individual panel members to standardize the data.  Datasets were produced that included the 
standardized expert panel classifications for all items from each assessment (including multiple 
classifications on the reliability set) as well as original classification information for each item 
provided by the assessment developers.  The raw data containing all original panelist classifications 
and comments from each subgroup were also available for analysts and were consulted in the writing 
of this report.

Scoring guide 
In this question the student was given information in two different ways—a fractional part and a number of items—
and the student needed to justify that these two interpretations of the same situation were consistent.  To answer the 
question, the student needed to observe that the fractional part has meaning in terms of the number of items, or that 
the number of items can be represented as a fractional part of the whole amount.  Students were permitted to use a 
calculator. 
Correct 
They can both be right because ¼ of 20 = 5 and 20 – 5 = 15 
OR 
¼ is 5 and ¾ is 15 
OR 
 
Sara ¼ or 5 
Brendan ¾ or 15 
| | | | | 
| | | | |   | | | | |   | | | | | 
 
Partial 
¼ is 5 
OR  
¾ is 15 
OR 
“Sara has 5” (5 must be connected to Sara; if states Sara has 5 because 20 – 15 = 5, item is scored as incorrect). 
Incorrect 
Incorrect response (includes 20 – 15 = 5,  5 + 15 = 20, and switching names)

Ted wants to purchase floor covering for the hallway shown above. He knows there are many ways 
to find the area of the hallway. One way is to divide the hallway into the sections shown below and 
then add together the area of each section. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Area of Hallway = Area of Region I + Area of Region II 
Area = (5 x 10) + (7 x 5)

Scoring guide 
In this question the student was asked to draw and explain three different ways to divide an L-shaped region to 
determine the area.  The student was also required to give an expression representing the area for each of the 
different divisions of the region (however, the student was not asked to calculate the area of the region).  There 
are many possible ways to do this but to earn full credit the student needed to show three different divisions of the 
region, label the lengths in each figure correctly, and write an expression for the area consistent with each figure.  
This question requires visualization and knowledge of one or more formulas for finding area. 
Any division of the figures into rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, or parallelograms is acceptable.  Student either 
needs to show (5 x 5) + (5 x 12), for example OR label all appropriate dimensions in the figure to give credit for 
25 + 60.  However, “25 + 60” is not acceptable if dimensions are not labeled. 
Extended 
Three figures divided correctly with no incorrect labels and three correct expressions for area. 
Satisfactory 
Three figures divided correctly with no incorrect labels and two correct expressions for area. 
Partial 
Two figures divided correctly with no incorrect labels and one or two correct expressions for area of those 
figures. 
OR 
Three figures divided correctly with no incorrect labels and one correct expression for area. 
Minimal 
One figure divided correctly with no incorrect labels and correct expression for area of that figure. 
OR 
Two or three figures divided correctly with no incorrect labels and no correct (or missing) expressions for area of 
figures. 
Incorrect

plans it offers.  
 
They must pay a set fee each month and there are different rates for each minute they talk. These 
rates depend on the time of the day or night they use the phone, and on which payment plan they 
choose. Both plans include time for which phone calls are free. Details of the two plans are shown 
in the table below.

Scoring guide 
In this question the student was asked to compare the sale price of a stereo, after 3 weeks, based on two different 
ways for reducing the price.  In one store, the price was reduced each week by a fixed amount (10% of $100, or 
$10).  In the other store the price was reduced each week by a varying amount (10% of the current price, which is 
less each week). To earn full credit, the student needed to indicate that the price would be less at the first store 
after 3 weeks and explain how the solution was obtained.  Students were permitted to use a calculator. 
Solution: 
A. Cheaper at Price Pleasers 
 
At Price Pleasers the stereo would be $80 after 2 weeks. 
At Bargain Plus, it would cost $81. 
OR 
Successive 10% reductions of the original price will yield greater savings than successive reductions of 10% of 
the reduced price. 
Correct 
Correct response—cheaper at Price Pleasers with an explanation that compares price at each store after 2 weeks 
($80 vs. $81). 
OR 
Cheaper at Price Pleasers with an explanation that generalizes as described in solution above. 
NOTE: Score CORRECT if incorrect answer is B or C with a clear statement that Price Pleasers is cheaper and 
explanation is correct and complete. 
Partial 
Cheaper at Price Pleasers with anything less than a complete explanation. 
OR 
Computes the correct amount for at least 2 weeks for either Price Pleasers or Bargain Plus, but conclusion is 
missing, incomplete, or incorrect (if the store is not identified the score is still a 2) 
Incorrect 
Incorrect response. 
 
 
One store, Price Pleasers, reduces the price each week of a $100 stereo by 10 percent of the 
original price.  
 
Another store, Bargains Plus, reduces the price each week of the same $100 stereo by 10 percent 
of the previous week's price.  
 
After 2 weeks, how will the prices at the two stores compare? 
 
(A) The price will be cheaper at Price Pleasers. 
(B) The price will be the same at both stores. 
(C) The price will be cheaper at Bargain Plus. 
 
Explain your reasoning.

Scoring guide 
This question was a word problem that asked students to consider two values—the number of letters and the 
number of postcards—even though the student was only asked for the number of letters.  This question could be 
solved in several ways.  A student could reason numerically to find the number of letters and the number of 
postcards, possible by using a guess-and-check strategy or by creating a table.  Another possibility was to set up 
and solve a system of two linear equations in two unknowns.  To earn full credit, students needed to show how 
they obtained the answer.  Students were permitted to use a calculator. 
Solution: 
8 letters 
.20 (6) + .33(8) = $3.84 
Students may use a variety of strategies to solve this, including guess and check, formal algebra, or others.  For 
example, 
# postcards 
# letters

Therefore .20x + .33(14-x) = 3.84 
So x = 6 and y = 8

Scoring guide 
 
Question 1 
Full credit 
168.3 cm (unit already given). 
No credit 
Other responses. 
 
Question 2 
Full credit 
Gives the correct interval, from 11-13 years. 
OR 
States that girls are taller than boys when they are 11 and 12 years old.  (This answer is correct in daily-life 
language because it means the interval from 11-13). 
Partial credit 
Other subsets of (11, 12, 13), not included in the full credit section. 
No credit 
Other responses. 
 
Question 3 
Full credit 
The key here is that the response should refer to the “change” of the gradient of the graph for female.  This can be 
done explicitly or implicitly. Full credit is for explicitly mentioning about the steepness of the curve of the graph 
or for implicit comparison using the actual amount of growth before 12 years and after 12 years of age. 
Refers to the reduced steepness of the curve from 12 years onwards, using daily-life language, not mathematical 
language. 
OR 
Refers to the reduced steepness of the curve from 12 years onwards, using mathematical language. 
OR 
Comparing actual growth (comparison can be implicit). 
No credit 
Student indicates that female height drops below male height, but does NOT mention the steepness of the female 
graph or a comparison of the female growth rate before and after 12 years. 
OR 
Other incorrect responses.  For example, the response does not refer to the characteristics of the graph, as the 
question clearly asks about how the graph shows the answer.
