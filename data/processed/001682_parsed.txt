basis of any necessary compliance or follow-up objectives.  Each agency will promptly
notify the other when there is a change in an assigned contact person.
B. 
Coordination of Investigations 
Upon request, FDA and NRC will assist each other, to the fullest extent possible, in the
investigation of incidents or complaints involving products of mutual regulatory concern.  
For the purposes of this MOU, investigations will be considered to include inspections in
response to incidents or events, as well as, formal investigations initiated in accordance
with each agency's internal procedures, (Agreement States will be involved as
appropriate to the specific situation).  During the term of this agreement, joint inspections
or observer invitations can be requested or extended by either agency, when deemed
necessary, to ensure that information obtained from an investigation is collected, shared
and acted upon in a timely and coordinated manner.  Both agencies will make every
reasonable effort to accommodate joint inspection or observer requests depending upon
availability of personnel and current FDA or NRC priorities.  Each agency will assign one
or more persons to assure that investigations are coordinated in a manner that
maximizes regulatory efficiency and minimizes duplication of effort.  Each agency will
promptly notify the other when there is a change in an assigned contact person.

appropriate) will be exercised to the extent authorized by law, and by NRC and FDA
directives, statutes, and regulations, and will be consistent with the respective agency's
mission.
Both agencies recognize the need to protect from public disclosure, data and information
that are exchanged between the agencies and that fall within the definition of trade
secret, or confidential commercial or financial information.  Both agencies agree to
exchange proprietary information in accordance with applicable regulations.  If FDA
provides NRC with trade secret information, there shall be an additional written
agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the appropriate liaison officers
in accordance with 21 CFR 20.90.  If a request calls for a disclosure determination
regarding proprietary information such as a Freedom of Information Act request, 
response to a Congressional inquiry, or in cases where either agency must comply with
various regulatory or public information responsibilities, for any such information obtained
from the other agency, that agency will be notified of the request.  The notified agency will
be responsible for making any needed contact with the submitter of the protected
information and accept the responsibility for evaluating the submitter's comments prior to
rendering the disclosure determination.
