The Grand Jury charges:
COUNT 1
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MAIL FRAUD
1.
From on or about April 2000, through on or about July 19, 2005, in the
Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, and elsewhere, in and outside of the United
States, Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased, NASSER M. KAHOOK, aka NORMAN,  ABDEL
NASSER JUDEH, GUY M. BOCIAN, and MOHAMMAD RIBHI KAHOOK, aka MIKE
-2-
ALKHUQ willfully and knowingly combined, conspired, confederated and agreed with
each other and  with others both known and unknown to the Grand Jury  to commit the
following offense against the United States:  To devise a scheme and artifice to defraud
and for obtaining money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and
promises and for the purpose of executing the scheme and artifice and attempting to do so,
to knowingly place and cause to be placed in an authorized depository for mail matter
things to be sent and delivered by the United States Postal Service, to wit, checks of the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, other tobacco companies,  and of agents of those
companies to be sent and delivered by the United States Postal Service, all in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 1341.
The schemes alleged in this count are as follows:
 I.
THE R. J. REYNOLDS BUY DOWN SCHEME
2.
At all times relevant to this count, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company and other
companies selling such cigarette brands as Camel, Doral, Salem, Monarch, Winston,
Phillip Morris,  Newport, Parliament, Kool, Virginia Slim, and Pall Mall (collectively
referred to herein as  “cigarette companies”) engaged in sales promotions programs to
encourage retailers of cigarette products to sell selected brands by offering reimbursements
or rewards to retailers based upon the number of cartons or packages of cigarettes sold by
the retailers. One such promotional plan was referred to as a “Buy Down Program”
wherein a representative of the tobacco company would audit wholesaler’s billings to a
particular store to determine the gross payment due the retailer for cartons sold.  Under the
-3-
"Buy Down Program," R.J. Reynolds would reimburse the retail vendor for the difference
in price between the promoted price and the regular price of cigarettes.  For example, if the
retailer sold cigarettes at a promotional price of $4.00 off per carton, R. J. Reynolds would
subsequently reimburse the store owner $4.00 per carton sold.
a.
It was part of the conspiracy,  that at various times throughout the
course of the conspiracy , that Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased, NASSER M. KAHOOK, aka

KAHOOK, aka MIKE ALKHUQ, were associated in fact with each other and with various
retail establishments (referred to hereinafter as “stores”), either as owners, corporate
representatives, managers,  or operators of the stores at various locations in Northeast
Ohio.  Some of the locations were from time to time  known by the following business
names and identifications, under which names they would contract and make claims for
rebates for various sales promotions:

with persons representing themselves to be the owners/operators of the above-referenced

e.
It was a further part of the conspiracy that the defendant, Ribhi M.
Kahook, deceased, and other conspirators would, at various times, obtain and use  invoice
numbers from Adco Distributors Inc. and Anchor Cigar and Candy Co. Inc., wholesalers of
cigarette, candy,  and other convenience store goods, as well as invoices of other
wholesalers,  which the conspirators  presented as documenting  the underlying purchases
of cigarette products by their stores, upon which rebate claims were being made on the
“RJRT Buydown Summary Sheets” and presented to an R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company 
-8-
sales representative. 
f.
It was a further part of the conspiracy that, throughout the course of
the conspiracy, the defendant, Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased, would meet with a sales
representative for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and cause the false and fraudulent
rebate claim information to be entered into the sales representative’s laptop computer for
transmission by wire of the reimbursement claims into the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company’s headquarter computer system for the purpose of approving rebates to the stores
listed above.  Based upon these transmissions, reimbursement checks were mailed to the
claimant stores from Winston Salem, North Carolina to Akron, Ohio, and its environs.
3.
During the course of the conspiracy and to effect its objects, the following
overt acts were committed in the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division and
elsewhere:
Transmission of claims and receipt of funds
On  the dates listed below, in the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern
Division, and elsewhere, the defendants,  for the purpose of executing the conspiracy, did
cause to be placed into the laptop computer of an R.J. Reynolds Company sales
representative signs, signals, and data which were to be transmitted to the  R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to support the fraudulent rebate
claims, which signs, signals and data were transmitted on or about the date indicated and
based upon which signals a rebate check was issued on the dates listed below.  The 
proceeds received from each rebate claim which the defendants caused to be deposited are
as follows, each such transaction set being an overt act of conspiracy:

THE COUPON REBATE SCHEME
4.
Coupons are legal documents that offer consumers discounts on the purchase
of products such as grocery items.  The coupons are issued by the manufacturers of products
and are often distributed to the public though direct mail to consumers or are attached to
products sold.  The coupons give a financial discount to the purchaser of a product.  The
discount is provided by a retailer, who is then entitled to reimbursement from the
manufacturer issuing the coupon.
-14-
a.
Using the same stores, accounts, businesses and individuals identified
above, it was further part of the conspiracy that Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased, NASSER M.
KAHOOK, and other conspirators at various times during the course of the conspiracy would
order quantities of cigarettes purportedly to supply one or more of the stores with inventory,  
claim promotional rebates based on the retail sale of those inventories, and then later return
some of those cigarettes to wholesalers while using coupons from the ordered cigarettes to
claim reimbursement as if those coupon’s value had been redeemed by the purchaser at retail
sale.
b.
It was part of the conspiracy that Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased,
NASSER M. KAHOOK, and other conspirators at various times during the course of the
conspiracy would gather large quantities of coupons from  cigarette packages and other
sources and submit those coupons to cigarette manufactures to obtain rebates to which they
were not entitled. 
c.
It was further part of the conspiracy that Ribhi M. Kahook, deceased,
NASSER M. KAHOOK and other conspirators would redeemed multiple coupons for a
consumer in exchange for cartons of cigarettes, exceeding the retail value of the cartons of
cigarettes and then claim reimbursement for those coupons as if only one coupon had been
refunded at the point of sale.
5. 
During the course of the conspiracy and to effect its objects,  the following
overt acts were performed in the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division and elsewhere:
Overt Acts Concerning Coupons
(1)
On February 21, 2004,  NASSER M.  KAHOOK discussed with
-15-
Mansour M. Kahook the fact that Ribhi Kahook  had been scamming with cigarettes, his
profits reaching $70,000. 
(2)
On February 23, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK asked Ribhi Kahook 
if Ribhi had received any checks.  Ribhi Kahook  replied he had a check from R.J. Reynolds
for $1,300.   Ribhi told NASSER he wanted to order four hundred cartons of cigarettes, as it
will clear him $1,200 based upon a $3 promotional coupon in each carton being offered by
Pall Mall.  NASSER warned Ribhi to be careful as “we are being watched by the
Government.”  Ribhi advised NASSER that “the government doesn’t look at something
small  as long as we do not do something big.”
(3)
On February 24, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK complained to Jeff
Lake that Ribhi Kahook bought over $110,000 worth of cigarettes in six weeks.
(4)
On February 25, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK complained to Abu
Ibrahim (located at Starfire Express) about Ribhi sending his son Basher to take 56 cases of
soda from Starfire Express.  NASSER told Ibrahim “we received a check for $6,000 and
another for $4,000.”  NASSER told Ibrahim, on top of all this,  he ordered cigarettes for
$10,000 and has a payment to Adco for $7,500".  NASSER told Ibrahim that Ribhi is hiding
the money in his son Basher’s name. NASSER told Ibrahim to write a list of all Ribhi’s
cigarette activities. 
(5)
On February 25, 2004, Ribhi Kahook spoke with NASSER M.
KAHOOK and told him he had an order of cigarettes coming tomorrow and not to worry
about paying as “we are getting a rebate check from Charlie” and that he was going to pay
(Adco) for  500 cartons and then place an order for $25,000.
-16-
(6)
On February 25, 2004, an unknown male (UM) told NASSER M.
KAHOOK that Ribhi ordered 400 cartons of cigarettes and ordered more for tomorrow “so
we can use them for the coupons”.  The UM told NASSER  “the people form Newport will
be coming out to pay us tomorrow”. NASSER asked  how many are left and is told only 100.
NASSER responded “OUT OF 9,000".  NASSER instructed the UM to check for sure as “we
had 7,280 cartons”.
(7)
On February 26, 2004, Mansour M. Kahook spoke with NASSER M.
KAHOOK about the need for cash and that nobody will question Ribhi when he takes
cigarettes “out the back door.”  They further discussed that Ribhi didn’t like going to the
bank, so he bothers them to do so.
(8)
On February 27, 2004, NASSER M.  KAHOOK told Abu Sherik,
telling him “we need to get together and become a buying power so we can dictate terms”.
Sherik told NASSER he is buying a lot of cigarette cartons, gets the deal and then returns
them. Sherik agreed they should get together and become a buying power.
(9)
On February 27, 2004, (Abu Ibrahim {Rafat Al-Eisawi}) Ibrahim told
NASSER M.KAHOOK  they had received delivery of cigarettes for $16,753, mostly
Newport brand, and that Ribhi was not there.  Ibrahim told NASSER he gave the cigarette
company a company check.  NASSER asked for a report of yesterday’s transactions. 
(10)
On February 28, 2004, NASSER M.  KAHOOK called Ribhi Kahook
at Starz Market and they discussed the amount of money they had available. Ribhi stated he
ordered cigarettes for Monday. NASSER and Ribhi discussed  Abu Ibrahim’s not wanting to
charge people and make good money. Ribhi  indicated that yesterday he sold 3 cartons for
-17-
$120 to a woman who had a $40 coupon.
(11)
On March 3, 2004, Ribhi Kahook spoke with NASSER M.  KAHOOK
concerning the “Winston” people and preparing coupons for redemption. NASSER asked if
GUY BOCIAN had gotten some. 
(12)
On March 12, 2004, Barry Adelman told NASSER M.  KAHOOK that
Adelman wanted his cigarettes back. NASSER told him to do what he has to do.
(13)
On March 15, 2004, Barry Adelman told NASSER M. KAHOOK that
Adelman heard they were getting cigarettes from a competing supplier.  NASSER M.
KAHOOK denied it.  Adelman indicated he was going to send a representative to look at the
cigarettes for the coupons. 
(14)
On March 16, 2004, NASSER M.  KAHOOK called Ihab at Starfire
Express, who told NASSER they were expecting the Newport representative the next day
and they would get a big fat check. 
(15)
On March 22, 2004, NASSER M.  KAHOOK spoke with Rafat Al-
Eisawi, an individual named but not indicated herein, who reported that Tawfeek brought the
money today and they received a check from Phillip Morris. Eisawi will call R.J. Reynolds.
NASSER told him to have the money ready.
 
-18-
(16)
On March 22, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK told Mike (LNU)  “just
get the cigarette check from him and bring it.”
(17)
On March 22, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK spoke with Rafat Al-
Eisawi, who reported that everything has been processed regarding the coupons. Eisawi told
NASSER it takes 4-5 weeks and nothing has been sent by R.J. Reynolds.
(18)
On April 12, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK asked Rafat Al-Eisawi
about the Brown and Williamson check, and they discussed taking cigarettes back. 
(19)
On April 12, 2004, Mansour M. Kahook asked NASSER M. 
KAHOOK about the Brown and Williamson check that Abu Ibrahim {Rafat Al-Eisawi} had
received. 
(20)
On May 5, 2004, NASSER M. KAHOOK asked Ihab Traish if “she”
had counted the coupons yet.  NASSER asked the amount, probably $11,000. 
(21)
On May 12, 2004, James Lucas spoke with Ribhi Kahook and told him
about getting a subpoena regarding R.J. Reynolds. Ribhi and Lucas discussed an attorney to
represent Lucas. Ribhi and Lucas will meet at 8 a.m. tomorrow.
(22)
On May 12, 2004, Mansour M. Kahook told NASSER M. KAHOOK  
that the “cross eyed” man (Lucas) called Ribhi. Mansour told NASSER that they will meet 
at 8 a.m. tomorrow. 
(23)
On May 14, 2004, Ribhi Kahook told Mansour M. Kahook that he told
(the person he had met with) to hire the attorney Na’el recommended.  Mansour M. Kahook
asked if he was going to hire the attorney. Mansour M. Kahook said that the important thing
was that “he do what Na’el said and not get scared.”
-19-
(24)
On May 14, 2004,  Tawfeek Kahook discussed with NASSER M.
KAHOOK an attorney who would represent the “cross eyed guy”. 
(25)
Between August 31, 2004 and July 19, 2005 Carolina Manufacturing
Services, an agent of R. J. Reynolds in Winston Salem, N.C., mailed checks to Starfire
Express in Akron, Ohio totaling $67,876.28 based upon coupons fraudulently presented for

M. GHEITH, JAMES HIGGINBOTTAM, aka REVEREND JIM, and NUNZIE V.
FRAGOLA , did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together
and with diverse other persons, both known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to unlawfully,
knowingly and willfully conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, and own all or part of
an illegal gambling business, which used illegal slot machines, instant bingo parlors, and
instant bingo tickets, which was conducted in such a manner as to violate the laws of the
State of Ohio (Ohio Revised Code Sections 2915.01, 2915.02,  2915.03, and 2915.07) which
gambling business involved five or more persons who conducted, financed, managed,
supervised, directed, and owned all or part thereof, and which gambling business was in
substantially continuous operation in excess of 30 days and had a gross revenue in excess of
$2,000 a single day, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1955.
21.
It was part of the conspiracy that NASSER M. KAHOOK, aka NORMAN, 
NUNZIE V. FRAGOLA and others, solicited charitable organizations to enabled them to
operate gambling businesses which operations would appear to be in compliance with the
laws of the State of Ohio. The laws of the State of Ohio permit certain charitable gambling
operations which must be conducted only to produce revenues for a “charitable
organization”.  All money or assets from the games of chance after deductions only of prizes
paid out during the conduct of the games must be transferred to the charity. A “charitable
organization” means a tax exempt organization which has received a determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service stating that it is exempt from federal taxation under
subsection 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
-44-
22.
It was the object of this conspiracy to conduct gambling operations to produce
income, profits, and revenues for the individual co-conspirators, their associates, businesses
and relatives,  and in order to do this, charities were solicited to allow the use of their name
as the beneficiary or sponsor of the gambling businesses.
23.
It was further part of the conspiracy that for-profit gambling operations were
conducted through the use of the names of charities so it would appear to the public, local
officials, and law enforcement agencies that the gambling operations were being conducted
in compliance with State of Ohio gambling laws and regulations.
24.
It was further part of the conspiracy that “Instant Bingo Video Gambling
Machines” (slot machines) were placed in store fronts and the co-conspirators represented to
the general public, their gambling customers, law enforcement officials and courts, that they
were not slot machines which are prohibited by state law.
25.
It was further part of the conspiracy that bank accounts were opened to
facilitate the payment of expenses of the store fronts, make some limited contributions to
some charities, and pay business expenses of associated enterprises operated by the
conspirators from funds derived from gambling.
