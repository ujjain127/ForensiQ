PREFACE 
The Generic Code Sheet Menu is a set of Decentralized Hospital Computer Program 
options that help users create code sheets, group them into batches for transmitting to a 
central computer, and transmit the batches.  The package also helps users, organize, copy, 
and delete code sheets. 
This user's guide uses a simple, procedural format to explain how to perform the above 
tasks.  The chapters and sections in this guide reflect the structure of the submenus and 
options, which will help users learn the structure of the Generic Code Sheet Menu as they 
follow the instructions in the guide.

1 chapter Introduction 
1.1 The Generic Code Sheet Package 
The Generic Code Sheet Package is a set of menus and options in the Decentralized 
Hospital Computer Program (DHCP).  The Generic Code Sheet Package allows users to 
create, edit, and transmit code sheets from DHCP to a central computer system.  Users 
can use the Generic Code Sheet Package to help them create a code sheet, or users can 
create code sheets manually. 
1.2 How to Use This Manual 
This manual explains how to use the Generic Code Sheet Package by explaining how to 
use the system to perform simple, manageable tasks.  The authors of this manual have 
listed these tasks in successive order so that each instruction builds on the functionality 
and information from the previous instructions.  This will allow new users to use this 
manual as a tutorial by following the instructions from beginning to end.  Experienced 
users can use this manual as a reference tool by using the index and table of contents. 
1.3 Reference Numbering System 
This manual uses a special paragraph numbering system to allow users to understand 
how the sections of the manual relate to each other.  For example, this paragraph is 
section 1.3.  This means that this paragraph is the main paragraph for the third section of 
Chapter 1.  If there were two subsections to this section, they would be numbered 
sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.  A paragraph numbered 1.3.5.4.7 would be the seventh 
subsection of the fourth subsection of the fifth subsection of the third subsection of 
Chapter 1.  All clear?  Actually, all this means is that users that want to divide their 
reading into manageable lessons can concentrate on one section and all of its 
subsections, e.g., section 1.3.5.4 and all of its subsections would make a coherent lesson. 
1.4 Package Management, Legal Requirements and Security 
Measures 
In order to use the Generic Code Sheet Package, users are given access to the Generic 
Code Sheet Package options.  Some of these menu options may be additionally controlled 
by the use of access “keys”.  These access keys are administered to individual users by 
the Information Resources Management Service at their facility.

1.5 Package Operation 
This document explains how to use the Generic Code Sheet Package to create and amend 
code sheets.  Novice users will be unfamiliar with the information that some of the 
Generic Code Sheet Package prompts require.  The Generic Code Sheet Package 
provides three levels of explanations for the prompts.  Enter a question mark at the 
prompt to read a description of the prompt, two question marks to read a more complex 
explanation of the prompt, and three question marks to read a complete description of the 
prompt and read a list of acceptable responses to the prompt.

2 chapter Create a code sheet 
2.1 Introduction 
The principal use of the Generic Code Sheet Menu is to create code sheets.  Code sheets 
are used to create data in a format that other computer systems can use.  Prior to DHCP, 
users completed paper forms, which were transcribed onto punch cards.  The punch cards 
would be mailed to a central computer for processing.  Today, users create code sheets 
and transmit the data electronically to the central computer.  This makes data entry faster, 
cheaper, and more accurate. 
2.2 Menu Path 
Select Create a Code Sheet from the Generic Code Sheet Menu.  Enter a Station Number.  
Enter the batch type at the Select Generic Code Sheet Batch Type Name: prompt for the 
type of code sheet you want to create.  If you do not know the batch type, enter three 
question marks at the prompt and the system will list the available batch types.

2.3 Four Code Sheet Examples:  Nursing Social Work, 
Consulting/Attending, and Financial Management 
 
Each code sheet has different questions for you to answer as you create the code sheet.  
Due to the long list of code sheets, only four types are explained here.  For detailed 
explanations of the prompts for a code sheet not listed here, contact your local IRM 
service. 
 
2.3.1 Nursing Code Sheet Prompts 
2.3.1.1 Select Batch Type and Segment Name 
Enter Nursing at the Select Generic Code Sheet Batch Type Name: prompt.  Choose a 
segment name at the Select Generic Code Sheet Transaction Type/Segment Name: 
prompt.  A segment is a group of code sheet types that make up a batch type.  For 
example, 'Nursing' is a group of segments or code sheet types.  The batch type describes 
the destination computer system for transmissions.  The segment name determines the 
type of code sheet. 
The system will assign an identification number to the code sheet.  WRITE THIS 
NUMBER DOWN!  You will need it to edit the code sheet or assign it to a batch.

7 Chapter Stack Menu 
7.1 Introduction 
 
The Stack Menu is a new menu of options that manage stacks of Financial Management 
System (FMS) code sheets.  The Generic Code Sheet system does not assign FMS code 
sheets to batches; instead, the system adds these code sheets to a special file called a 
stack file, which allows the system to transmit the code sheets as a single file in a form 
that FMS can interpret. 
7.2 Retransmit Stack File Document 
7.2.1 Introduction 
This option allows users to retransmit FMS code sheets.  Users will use this option if 
FMS rejects the stack entry for a code sheet or an entire stack.

8.1 Introduction 
 
The 'Transmit Code Sheets' option transmits a batch (group) of code sheets to a central 
computer for processing. 
 
Note: Do not attempt to use this option to transmit FMS code sheets.  FMS code 
sheets are transmitted from a special file called a stack file as they are 
created.  If you want to retransmit an FMS code sheet or determine the 
status of a code sheet, use the options in the Stack Menu. 
8.2 Step 1

11 chapter 11  technical overview 
11.1  Introduction 
This chapter explains how the Generic Code Sheet system performs its functions.  The 
section below lists the major data components of the Generic Code Sheet System and 
how they interact. 
11.2  Data Components 
11.2.1 The Code Sheet File 
The Generic Code Sheet system uses a code sheet file, 2100 GENERIC CODE SHEET, 
to define the data fields for applications that use the Generic Code Sheet system.  The 
Generic Code Sheet system uses VA FileMan to manage data entry and code sheet file 
retrieval.  
11.2.2 The Batching Routine 
The Generic Code Sheet system uses a routine to assign code sheets to a batch and 
prepare batches for transmission by extracting the data elements from the physical fields 
within the code sheet.  This routine records and reformats the data elements into the 
format required by the receiving system. 
11.2.3 The Batch Transmitting Routine 
The Generic Code Sheet system uses a routine to transmit batches of code sheets.  This 
routine copies the code sheet data into a VA Mailman message addressed to the network 
queue.  
11.2.4 The Code Sheet Management Subsystem 
The Generic Code Sheet system uses a subsystem to record the generation, batch 
assignment, and transmission history of all code sheets.  
11.3  Related Documentation 
This document is one of a suite of documents that refer to the Generic Code Sheet system 
and its superordinate systems.  To understand the structure and function of the Generic 
Code Sheet system, read the Generic Code Sheet User Manual, the Generic Code Sheet 
Technical Manual, the VA MailMan Technical Manual, and the VA FileMan Manual. 
Technical Overview 
 
Generic Code Sheet 2.0 User's Guide 
March 1995

11.4   Functional Description 
 
The Generic Code Sheet System uses file 2100 GENERIC CODE SHEET to store the 
fields and the actual code sheets.  Fields ranging from .001 to 51 are reserved for system 
use.  Fields numbered from 52 to 99 are reserved fields used for multiple types of code 
sheets (generic fields, i.e., STATION NUMBER, etc.).  A request should be made to the 
GECS REQUEST mail group on FORUM for approval to create fields in this range.  
Fields for specific packages (i.e., Dental Service, etc.) should use fields in  the number 
range dependent on the responsible ISC.  For example, the global node used to store 
Dental Code Sheets for the Washington ISC would be DENTDAS2, where DENT is the 
namespace, DAS is the system identifier, and the Washington ISC code is 2.  The entire 
global node would be '^GECS(2100,DA,"DENTDAS2",'.  If all the fields cannot be 
placed on this node, use the same node name concatenated with a character of the 
alphabet starting with the letter 'A'.  For example: DENTDAS2A, DENTDAS2B, 
DENTDAS2C, etc.  The following table indicates the available field number for each 
ISC: 
 
Albany ISC       
fields 100 to 199   and   fields 1000 to 1999 
Washington ISC 
fields 200 to 299   and   fields 2000 to 2999 
Birmingham ISC 
fields 300 to 399   and   fields 3000 to 3999 
Chicago ISC     
fields 400 to 499   and   fields 4000 to 4999 
Salt Lake City ISC 
fields 500 to 599   and   fields 5000 to 5999 
San Francisco ISC 
fields 600 to 699   and   fields 6000 to 6999 
Dallas ISC 
 
fields 700 to 799   and   fields 7000 to 7999 
 
Specific input templates pertaining to a package should be set up in the following format: 
package namespace, SPACE, batch type followed by the ISC code number, SPACE, a 
description.  For example, the Dental Service Code sheets input template would be 
defined by 'DENT DAS2 01 TRANSACTION TYPE CODE SHEETS' where DENT is 
the namespace for the Dental Package, DAS is the system identifier, 2 is the Washington 
ISC code, and 01 TRANSACTION TYPE CODE SHEETS is the description. 
11.5   Namespace Conventions 
The namespace used for all routines is 'GECS', with file numbers ranging from 2100 to 
2101.7.

11.6  Key Variables 
Key variables for the package are as follows: 
 
 
GECS(, GECSA(, GECSC(, GECSSYS 
 
11.7   Security Keys 
This version of the Generic Code Sheet Package uses the security key GECS SETUP to 
determine if a user is allowed to access the 'Initialize a Code Sheet Type' option. 
11.8   Globals 
All data is stored in the GECS global.  Files are extracted from this global as follows: 
 
2100 Generic Code Sheet 
2101.1 Generic Code Sheet Batch Type 
2101.2 Generic Code Sheet Transaction Type/Segment 
2101.3 Generic Code Sheet Transmission Record 
2101.4 Generic Code Sheet Template Maps 
2101.5 Generic Code Sheet Counter 
2101.6 Generic Code Sheet Lock 
2101.7 Generic Code Sheet Site

12 chapter   development issues 
12.1   Introduction 
This chapter explains how to define a code sheet.  It is intended for developers. 
12.2   Step 1 
Prepare the fields for the code sheet by using the 'Modify File Attributes' option of 
FileMan.  The fields will go into File 2100, Generic Code Sheet.  Each field will 
correspond to a data block on the actual code sheet.  Use filed numbers and global nodes 
assigned to the application and ISC.  Also, use any necessary output transforms for 
massaging the data to fit the data block of the actual code sheet. All output transforms 
MUST contain a check for data in the variable GECSOT in order for the input template 
maps to build correctly. For example: I $D(GECSOT) S Y=+Y.  Here is an example of 
setting up the fields associated with the following dental code sheet: 
 
                   1         2         3 
column #  123456789012345678901234567890 
data      DENT460061594JONES,RICHARD 
 
where columns 1-4 always is the type DENT  
columns 5-7 is the station number  
columns 8-13 is the date in the form MMDDYY  
columns 14-26 is the patient name (last, first) 
 
Enter the following information at the prompts: 
 
Select OPTION: 4 MODIFY FILE ATTRIBUTES 
MODIFY WHAT FILE: GENERIC CODE SHEET// 2100 GENERIC CODE SHEET 
 
Select FIELD: 2000 TYPE

'HELP'-PROMPT: ANSWER MUST BE 1-13 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH  
Replace  
XECUTABLE 'HELP': 
 
Next, create an output transform on the PATIENT NAME field: 
 
Select OPTION: 6 UTILITY FUNCTIONS 
 
MODIFY WHAT FILE: GENERIC CODE SHEET// 2100 GENERIC CODE SHEET 
 
Select UTILITY OPTION: OUTPUT TRANSFORM 
Select FIELD: 2003 PATIENT NAME 
PATIENT NAME OUTPUT TRANSFORM: I $D(GECSOT) S Y=Y_$E("[13 SPACES HERE]",$L(Y)+1,13) 
 
12.3   Step 2 - Create The Input Template 
Create an input template for the code sheet using the 'Enter or Edit File Entries' option. 
The fields in the input template correspond to the fields set up in step 1 above and must 
conform to the naming convention described in the Technical Overview Section of the 
Technical Manual. They should appear in the order in which they appear in the actual 
code sheet. If the input template is modified after the template map is built. the template 
map should be rebuilt (use the option 'Build Template Maps' in the Generic Code Sheet 
System).

THEN EDIT FIELD: 2002 PATIENT NAME  
STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: DENT DSA2 EXAMPLE 
ARE YOU ADDING 'DENT DSA2 EXAMPLE' AS A NEW INPUT TEMPLATE? Y (YES) 
12.4   Step 3 - Add Options to the Options File 
Add the options for your package to the OPTION File (19) that will be used for the 
generation and transmission of code sheets for your package.  Use VA FileMan and enter 
the options in your assigned package namespace.  Make the option type either MENU or 
ACTION.  For action options, you MUST set the variable GECSSYS to the selectable 
batch type.  Make a call for the option to the appropriate label in the GECSCALL 
routine.

15 GLOSSARY 
Batch Priority 
The batch priority indicates the priority of transmission 
of the code sheet within the patch.  A code sheet with a 
batch priority of 3 will be transmitted (in the same batch) 
before a code sheet with a batch priority of 4. 
Batch Type 
The batch type is set in which the code sheet definitions 
are grouped.  For example, the code sheets for Medicine 
are all grouped under the batch type ‘MEDICINE’.  
Security prevents unauthorized users from accessing 
code sheets outside of their selectable batch type. 
Batching 
Batching is the method for grouping a set of code sheets 
into a set.  The group of code sheets can then be 
transmitted within the same message.  Batching is 
usually done by ‘batch type’ (service) or by ‘system 
identifier’ (AMIS). 
Configuration 
A particular selection of hardware and software 
resources that are tailored to provide optimum usage of 
ADP systems.  This includes the type of CPU, type and 
number of Disk Drives, type and number of terminals, 
amount of main storage and so on. 
Control Characters 
The result of pressing the CTRL key and a letter key 
simultaneously. 
Data 
The information (facts, numbers, and symbols) entered 
into the system for processing and/or storage.   
Device 
Any part of the computer system other than the central 
processing unit, memory, or their associated structures.  
A device can be a physical piece of equipment, such as a 
terminal or a line printer, or a logical piece of equipment. 
DHCP 
The Decentralized Hospital Computer Program.   
FileManager 
Also known as FileMan.  A set of MUMPS routines used 
to enter, maintain, access and manipulate related data in 
a file.  It is the basic system used by all VA applications 
in creating all the files.

Global 
Either a simple global variable or global array stored on a 
disk. See Global Variable. 
Global Variable 
A variable which is stored on disk, usually as part of a 
global array.   
MailMan 
An electronic mail, teleconferencing, and networking 
system which is an integral part of the Kernel. 
MUMPS 
Massachusetts General Hospital Utility 
Multiprogramming System.  Also known as M.  This is 
the computer language used by all VA DHCP 
applications. 
Namespace 
A naming convention followed in the VA to identify 
various applications and to avoid duplication.  The 
namespace is used as the prefix for all routines and 
globals used by the application. 
Package 
A set of MUMPS routines, files, documentation and 
installation procedures that support a specific function 
within DHCP.   
Purging 
Purging is the process of removing old code sheets and 
batches from the system.  This only removes the data 
associated with a code sheet or batch number and NOT 
the actual definition of the code sheets or batches. 
Routine 
A collection of lines, saved, loaded, called, or overlaid as 
a single unit.  A set of computer instructions or symbolic 
statements combined to perform a task. 
Security Key 
Functions very much like your house or office key.  
Certain options may be locked with a key and that key 
assigned only to authorized users.   
Site Configurable 
A term used to refer to features in the system that can be 
tailored according to the needs of particular sites.  
System Identifier 
The system identifier is a three character code that 
identifies the code sheet type.  For example, AMS 
represents Amis code sheets, NSY represents staffing 
management code sheets, WGE represents wage survey 
code sheets, etc.

Transaction Type/Segment The transaction type/segment is the name of the actual 
code sheet.  For example, 223 would be the MAS AMIS 
223 code sheet, etc. 
Transmission 
Transmission is the process of electronically sending a 
batch of code sheets to a specified location through the 
VA network mail system.
