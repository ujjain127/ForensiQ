PECAN
L. J. Grauke and Tommy E. Thompson
USDA–ARS Pecan Breeding & Genetics, 
College Station, Texas
Cherryle. Seedling selection made by Win-
cen Williams, Grand Bay, Ala. Origin: used by 
Williams to topwork his orchard of Success and 
Schley trees in southern Alabama in the 1980s 
and given his wife’s name (pronounced Cherry 
Lee). A local pecan buyer, impressed by the nut’s 
quality, brought the selection to the attention of 
William Goff at Auburn University. Evaluated 
by Goff for pecan scab [Fusicladosporium ef-
fusum (Winter) Partridge and Morgan-Jones] for 
several years and currently rated as moderately 
susceptible (between Desirable and Stuart), 
and not recommended for unsprayed orchards. 
Evaluated by R.D. O’Barr at LSU Pecan Re-
search-Extension Station, Shreveport, La., who 
noted its excellent ﬂ avor. Nut: oblong elliptic 
to oblong, round in cross section, with obtuse 
apex and base; 43 nuts/lb, 55% kernel; kernels 
with medium dorsal grooves that do not trap 
packing material, slightly tapered dorsal ridge, 
shallow basal cleft.
Edisto. Seedling selection from the Edisto 
River drainage, near St. George, in Dorchester 
County, S.C. Origin: the tree grew on topo-
graphically high ground within a swamp that 
was later drained for agriculture, on land that 
was part of the original homestead of the Knight 
family, founders of Knightsville. Seed may have 
been introduced by native Americans or early 
settlers. The original tree is about 5 ft in diameter 
and approaches 120 ft in height. Gregg Knight, 
in his 1980s, noted that nearby trees planted by 
his grandparents in the late 1870s were in the 
2 to 3 ft diameter class. Anthony Fischinger 
submitted nuts of the tree for evaluation in 1999, 
and scions were obtained for grafting in the 
National Clonal Germplasm Repository. Nut: 
ovate with obtuse apex and rounded base; round 
in cross section; shell smooth, with few mark-
ings; 91 nuts/lb, 49% kernel; kernels golden, 
with broad, triangular dorsal ridge, relatively 
open dorsal grooves, and a prominent basal 
cleft and ventral groove.
Keilers (Stockbauer). Seedling selection 
made by Werner G. Keilers from yard tree 
growing in Travis Heights area of Austin, 
HORTSCIENCE VOL. 39(6) OCTOBER 2004
1514
Texas, in the early 1980s. Origin: Keilers was 
interested in patenting the selection, but that 
was not pursued. Graftwood was shared with 
the USDA–ARS Pecan Station in Brownwood, 
Texas, in 1983 under the name Keilers. He 
also shared graftwood with John Haschke 
of Harwood, Texas, who shared it with Fred 
Stockbauer of Victoria, Texas. Stockbauer 
was impressed with nut size and quality of the 
selection and began propagating it in the early 
1990s, and it began to be called Stockbauer. 
Graftwood of Stockbauer came in 1994 to the 
pecan collections of the USDA–ARS National 
Clonal Germplasm Repository, established in 
1984 to include collections of the Brownwood 
station.  Analyses using eight microsatellite 
primers showed the two accessions to be identi-
cal. They have indistinguishable nut characters, 
dichogamy and disease reactions. Keilers was 
assigned Plant Introduction number (PI) 518067. 
Nut: obovate to elliptic, blocky with obtuse 
apex and base, often with a slight point at base; 
prominent thick, dark stripes at apex; round in 
cross section; 42 nuts/lb, 60% kernel; kernels 
golden to light brown, with medium, slightly 
tapered dorsal ridge, relatively narrow dorsal 
grooves; slight basal cleft; deep, usually open 
ventral groove. Tree: protogynous with midsea-
son pollen shed and early pistillate receptivity. 
Susceptible (rated 3 on 1 to 5 scale, 5 = most 
susceptible) to pecan scab [Fusicladosporium 
effusum (Winter) Partridge and Morgan-Jones] 
and somewhat susceptible (rated 2 on 1 to 4 scale, 
4 = most susceptible) to veinspot (Gnomonia 
nerviseda Cole). 
Silverback. Seedling selection by Howard 
Gorrell, from tree growing in his yard in Okmul-
gee, Okla., Origin: grown from a volunteer nut 
that germinated about 1979. Low percent kernel 
due in part to very thick primary septum (to 3.2 
mm) and well developed secondary septum. First 
propagated in 1989, based on appearance of nuts 
in 1988 crop and released to nurserymen in 1995. 
Nut: orbicular with truncate apex that is char-
acteristically pinched at suture; rounded base; 
round to slightly compressed in cross section, 
appearing almost quadrangular; shell with wide, 
dark markings at apex; 33 nuts/lb, 50% kernel; 
kernels cream to golden, with medium broad, 
slightly triangular dorsal ridge, deep but wide 
dorsal grooves, and a prominent, wide ventral 
groove and small basal cleft. Tree: protandrous. 
Rated somewhat resistant (2 on 1 to 5 scale, 5 = 
most susceptible) to pecan scab under limited 
observations in College Station, Texas.

VC1-68. Pecan used as a proprietary root-
stock by Linwood Nurseries, Turlock, Calif., for 
planting in southwestern U.S. orchards. Origin: 
seedling selection from Phoenix, Ariz., made 
by Virgil Cripe in 1968 The name reﬂ ects the 
number 1 selection made by Virgil Cripe (VC) 
in 1968. Nut: oblong with acute apex and asym-
metrical, somewhat acute base; ﬂ attened in cross 
section; 48 nuts/lb, 48% kernel; kernels golden, 
with medium, straight dorsal ridge, relatively 
deep but open dorsal grooves; basal cleft usually 
shallow; ventral surface of kernel often cupped, 
with broad ventral groove. Nuts are large but 
relatively thick shelled and with a very thick 
middle septum, resulting in low kernel percent-
age. Tree: protandrous with early pollen shed 
and midseason pistillate receptivity. Extremely 
susceptible (rated 5 on 1 to 5 scale, 5 = most 
susceptible) to pecan scab. Nuts germinate well 
and seedlings are uniform and vigo

PRUNUS ROOTSTOCK
T.G. Beckman
USDA–ARS Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut 
Research Lab, Byron, Ga.
Krymsk 1TM. A clonal Prunus tomentosa x 
P. cerasifera hybrid rootstock for peach. Origin: 
developed by G. Eremin at the Vavilov Research 
Institute in Krymsk, Russia. Released in 1996 
for testing as VVA-1. Tree: Krymsk 1 is easily 
propagated by softwood and hardwood cuttings. 
Trees budded to Krymsk 1 are well anchored 
and more cold and drought tolerant than trees on 
peach seedling. Budded tree size is ca 60% of 
that on peach seedling. Krymsk 1 is not tolerant 
of drought but is tolerant of heavy, wet soils. 
Compatible with most apricots, most European 
plums and some Japanese plums. (Goodfruit 
Grower 49(10):11; 1998).
Krymsk 86TM. A clonal Prunus cerasifera x 
P. persica hybrid rootstock for peach. Origin: 
developed by G. Eremin at the Vavilov Research 
Institute in Krymsk, Russia. Released in 1986 
for testing as Kuban 86. Tree: Krymsk 86 is 
easily propagated by softwood and hardwood 
cuttings. Krymsk 86 is nonsuckering and toler-
ant of calcareous soils. Trees budded to Krymsk 
86 are more cold tolerant and precocious than 
trees on standard peach seedling. Budded tree 
size is about 80% of that on peach seedling. 
Krymsk 86 is more tolerant of waterlogging than 
peach seedling. Compatible with most almonds, 
apricots, European plums and Japanese plums.

Beltsville, Md. Selected from a wild population 
of Fragaria virginiana collected in Minnesota 
in 1986; tested as SG-89. Fruit and Plant:

responses, and fruit development. High degree 
of resistance to infection by highly virulent 
strains (Xf3, Xf6, 1425, and ATCC 33239) of 
X. fragariae. The type of resistance exhibited 
is hyposensitive in that inoculated tissues do 
not rapidly develop into necrotic areas and
