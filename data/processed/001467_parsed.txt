• Quantifying patterns of biodiversity has been 
hampered by poor taxonomic knowledge of 
small and uncommon organisms, woefully 
incomplete surveys over large areas (in the 
US and elsewhere), inadequate coupled 
models of field data and high-resolution 
remote sensing data, and little systematic 
monitoring to detect the status and trends of 
all but the most common or charismatic 
species.
Challenges with Fingerprinting Biodiversity
• Fingerprinting biodiversity in the US is 
facilitated by more complete taxonomic 
information for many taxa and long-term 
systematic monitoring of some taxa (e.g., 
birds, fishes, native and non-native vascular 
plants, mammals, amphibians) that jointly 
may provide some insights on the patterns of 
other biological groups.  Adequate data are 
at least available to test this basic 
assumption.
Challenges with Fingerprinting Biodiversity
• Because there currently exists no coherent 
scientific or technological framework for 
biodiversity assessments (especially at 
continental scales), we embarked on a 
multidisciplinary research study to advance 
the science and technology of mapping and 
modeling patterns of biodiversity (i.e., 
biological fingerprinting).
Background Justification for the Project
• We also sought to document the patterns of 
the invasion of harmful non-native plants, 
fishes, and birds in the U.S.
Researc Objectives: Based on Interdisciplinary 
Research Incorporating 
• Data from several remote sensing satellites;
• Synthesis of biodiversity field data sets from 
Department of Interior (USGS, BLM, NPS, BOR), 
Department of Agriculture (USFS, APHIS, ARS), 
non-government organizations (The Nature 
Conservancy, NatureServe), and universities; 
• New Multi-scale Geospatial Modeling-Mapping 
Algorithms (Web Intrenet Tools); and 
• High-Performance Computing Capabilities 
(HPCC-NASA-USGS) to document, map, and 
forecast the distributions and abundances of 
selected native and non-native plants and 
animals in the United States.
Researc Objectives: Based on Interdisciplinary 
Research Incorporating 
• Our state of the art research approach is proving 
successful at local and landscape scales. 
• We focused on Tamarix spp. (tamarisk, salt 
cedar) and Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) as test 
species for high-resolution mapping and 
modeling of harmful invasive species; however, 
our study has expanded well beyond these two 
species examining other invasive plant species, 
wildlife and pathogens. 
• In addition, we tested a new field pixel nested plot 
(PNP- Kalkhan et. al., 2007a,b) sampling design 
with link to geospatial information data for using 
geostatistical modeling and thematic mapping 
applications into forecasting biodiversity, 
environmental,  and ecological parameters.

CART models statistically partition the dependent data into two homogenous 
groups, repeating the procedure for each group in a continuing process that 
forms a hierarchal tree based on the predictive strength of each environmental 
variable (Evangelista et al. In Press).

Using the Envelope model, the number of non-native species was tracked 
over time in selected counties in Washington (Jarniviche et al. In Review).
• Understanding the geography and topography of the 
continental U.S. helped set the stage for evaluating patterns 
of species diversity. 
• Data from the 3,004 county centroids showed that as latitude 
increased from Mexico to Canada, mean annual temperature 
sharply declined (r = -0.91), and mean annual precipitation 
declined (r = -0.42) with exceptions no doubt in mountainous 
areas.  
• Due to the shape and topography of the US, increasing 
latitudes coincided with increasing distance to coastlines (r = 
0.54) and increasing mean elevation (r = 0.48)
The Geographic Setting
 We are not yet satisfied that we achieved our 
objectives.  Each of our data sets could be 
improved, as could the ancillary data layers 
used in geospatial modeling and the models 
themselves.
Conclusions and Future Directions
 This is the first attempt to evaluate patterns of 
native and non-indigenous vascular plants, birds, 
and fishes at multiple spatial scales relative to 
environmental factors, human population, and 
cross-correlations among the biological groups.  
Additional data on plant species richness are 
needed for many counties in the US (i.e., those 
with less than a few hundred native plant species 
seem suspiciously low).  
Conclusions and Future Directions
 Non-indigenous fish data have not all been 
refined to the 8-HUC (Hydolocgic Unit 
Code) drainage scale.  Additional data at 
higher resolutions will be helpful in refining 
spatially predictive models of species 
richness and density.
Conclusions and Future Directions
 Need to more closely link richness and 
density to abundance, cover, and 
dominance, and to link species-level data to 
habitat quantity, quality, and connectedness 
by roads and waterways (i.e., corridors of 
invasion) and barriers to invasion.  
Conclusions and Future Directions
 Caveats aside, we are gaining a much more 
robust general geospatial model –thematic 
maps of successful invasions by multiple 
biological groups.  The general patterns 
observed here provide insights into changes 
needed for prevention, early detection and 
rapid response, research, control, and 
monitoring.
