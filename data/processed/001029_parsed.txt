GENERIC DRUG ENTRY 
PRIOR TO PATENT EXPIRATION:
AN FTC STUDY
Executive Summary and Legislative Recommendations
Pharmaceutical drug products have
become increasingly important to providing
consumers with a myriad of treatments and
cures that increase life expectancy and
enhance lives.  It is critical to maintain
appropriate incentives for the development
of new drug products, because the necessary
research and development is risky and
costly.  Innovation in the pharmaceutical
industry, spurred in part by competitive
market forces, continues to bring enormous
benefits to Americans. 
At the same time, expenditures on
pharmaceutical products continue to grow
and often outpace expenditures for other
consumer products.  Pharmaceutical
expenditures concern not only consumers,
but government payers, private health plans,
and employers as well.  Generic drugs offer
opportunities for significant cost savings
over brand-name drug products.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments to
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
have shaped substantially the current legal
environment governing Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of generic
drug products.  Hatch-Waxman established a
regulatory framework that sought to balance
incentives for continued innovation by
research-based pharmaceutical companies
and opportunities for market entry by
generic drug manufacturers.  The
Amendments compensate brand-name
companies, in certain circumstances, for a
lengthy drug approval process, which can
shorten the effective life of patent protection
for drug products.  The Amendments also
streamline the procedures for bringing
generic drug products to the market.
Beyond any doubt, Hatch-Waxman
has increased generic drug entry.  Generic
drugs now comprise more than 47 percent of
the prescriptions filled for pharmaceutical
products ‚Äì up from 19 percent in 1984, when
Hatch-Waxman was enacted.
In spite of this record of success, two
of the provisions governing generic drug
approval prior to patent expiration (the 180-
day exclusivity and the 30-month stay
provisions) are susceptible to strategies that,
in some cases, may have prevented the
availability of more generic drugs.  These
provisions continue to have the potential for
abuse.  
The Commission has taken antitrust
law enforcement actions against certain
brand-name and generic drug companies
whose allegedly anticompetitive agreements
took advantage of one or the other of these
provisions.  Through vigorous enforcement
of the antitrust laws, the FTC has taken an
active role in ensuring that consumers
benefit from competition in the
pharmaceutical industry.
  This study examines whether the
conduct that the FTC challenged represented
isolated instances or is more typical, and
whether the 180-day exclusivity and the 30-
month stay provisions of the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments are susceptible to strategies to
ii
delay or deter consumer access to generic
alternatives to brand-name drug products. 
The study focuses solely on the procedures
used to facilitate generic drug market entry
prior to expiration of the patent(s) that
protect the brand-name drug product.  The
study does not address other procedures for
generic entry, and it does not address the
patent restoration features of Hatch-
Waxman.
To accomplish the study, the
Commission subpoenaed documents and
information from brand-name and generic
drug manufacturers, and examined instances
since 1992 in which generic applicants filed
an application with FDA seeking to enter the
market with a generic version of a drug
product prior to expiration of the brand-
name drug products‚Äô patents.1  An increasing
number of generic applicants have sought
entry prior to patent expiration.  During the
1980s, only 2 percent of generic applications
sought entry this way, but from 1998 to
2000, approximately 20 percent of the
generic applications sought entry prior to
patent expiration.  
The brand-name drug products
included in the study represent some of the
largest drug products as measured by annual
sales.  They include ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drugs2
such as Capoten, Cardizem CD, Cipro,
Claritin, Lupron, Neurontin, Paxil, Pepcid,
Pravachol, Prilosec, Procardia XL, Prozac,
Vasotec, Xanax, Zantac, Zocor, Zoloft, and
Zyprexa.
Based on the data obtained through
the study, we make two primary
recommendations concerning the 30-month
stay provision and the 180-day exclusivity to
mitigate the possibility of abuse that deters
more generic drugs from becoming
available.3
Recommendation 1: Permit only one
automatic 30-month stay per drug
product per ANDA to resolve
infringement disputes over patents
listed in the Orange Book prior to the
filing date of the generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA.
The Current 30-Month Stay Provision:  A
30-month stay of FDA approval of a generic
applicant4 is invoked if a brand-name
company receives notice of a generic
applicant‚Äôs paragraph IV certification and
files suit for patent infringement within 45
days of that notice.  Filing of the lawsuit
stays FDA‚Äôs approval of the ANDA until the
earliest of: (1) the date the patents expire;
(2) a determination of non-infringement or
patent invalidity by a court in the patent
litigation; or (3) the expiration of 30 months
from the receipt of notice of the paragraph
IV certification.
1 These applications are technically referred to as
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) containing
a paragraph IV certification.  
2 As used herein, ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù is defined as a
drug product that appears in the top 20 drug products (as
ranked publicly by annual gross sales) during one of the
years covered by this study.
3 The study did not provide data on whether, or
how, the suggested recommendations might affect brand-
name companies‚Äô and generic applicant‚Äôs incentives to
enter the market with new brand-name or generic drug
products.
4  For ease of discussion purposes, the term
‚Äúgeneric applicant‚Äù means those applicants who have filed
an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification.  See
Appendix A for a glossary of frequently used terms.

Key Facts From the Study:
To What Extent Does 30 Months
Approximate the Time Typically Required
for FDA Review of a Generic‚Äôs ANDA or
for Resolution of the Contemplated Patent
Infringement Litigation?
Thirty months historically has
approximated the time required for FDA
review and approval of the paragraph IV
ANDAs of generic applicants that were not
sued, and for district and appellate court
resolutions of ANDA-related patent
infringement litigation.  On average, the
time required for FDA review and approval
was 25 months and 15 days from the
application filing date in those cases where
generic applicants filing a paragraph IV
certification were not sued (and thus could
begin commercial marketing once they had
FDA approval).  On average, the time
between the filing of a patent infringement
lawsuit and a district court decision in the
case was 25 months and 13 days.  On
average, the time between the filing of a
patent infringement lawsuit and a court of
appeals decision in the case was 37 months
and 20 days.
In the future, patent infringement
litigation brought by brand-name companies
against generic applicants that have filed
ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications
may take longer to resolve.  The data suggest
that cases involving multiple patents take
longer than those involving fewer patents. 
As of June 1, 2002, for 6 out of the 7 cases
that have been pending for more than 30
months before a decision from a district
court, the brand-name company has alleged
infringement of 3 or more patents. 
Prior to 1998, for only 1 out of the 9
‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drug products in which the
brand-name company sued the first generic
applicant did the brand-name company
allege infringement of 3 patents.  Since
1998, for 5 of the 8 ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drug
products where the brand-name company
filed suit against the first generic applicant,
the brand-name company alleged
infringement of 3 or more patents.  Thus,
future 30-month stays may expire more
frequently before the parties obtain a
decision of a court in the patent infringement
litigation.        
Has the Study Identified Any
Circumstances That Can Prevent FDA
Approval of Generic ANDAs Beyond 30
Months?
Yes.  If a brand-name company lists
an additional patent in the Orange Book
after the generic applicant has filed its
ANDA, more than one 30-month stay may
be generated.  The generic applicant is
required to re-certify to this later-listed
patent, and if, upon notice of the generic‚Äôs
re-certification, the brand-name company
sues within 45 days, then FDA approval of
the generic‚Äôs previously filed ANDA is
stayed for an additional 30-months from the
notice date or until a court decision in the
newly instituted patent litigation.   
From 1992 through 2000, brand-
name companies have listed patents in the
Orange Book after an ANDA has been filed
for the drug product in 8 instances; 6 of
these 8 instances occurred since 1998.  For
the 8 drug products, the additional delay of
FDA approval caused by the additional 30-
month stay (beyond the first 30-month stay)
ranged from 4 to 40 months.  In all 4 of the
iv
cases so far with a court decision on the
validity or infringement of a later-issued
patent, the patent has been found either
invalid or not infringed by the ANDA.  
 Arguments exist that the later-issued
patents, which have provided the basis for
additional 30-month stays, do not meet
FDA‚Äôs requirements for listing patents in the
Orange Book.  (These arguments are
discussed in detail in Appendix H to the
Report.)  Under current court rulings and
FDA procedures, however, it is very difficult
for generic applicants to test these
arguments.  Recent court opinions have held
that Hatch-Waxman does not provide a
private right of action through which generic
applicants may challenge a patent listing in
the Orange Book.  The FDA has stated that
it lacks the resources and the expertise to
review patents to determine whether they are
properly listed.
Reasons for the Recommendation:
One 30-month period historically has
approximated the time necessary for FDA
review and approval of the generic‚Äôs ANDA. 
Thus, it does not appear that the 30-month
stay provision, as applied once to each
ANDA for patents listed in the Orange Book
prior to the ANDA‚Äôs filing date, has a
significant potential to delay generic entry
beyond the time already necessary for FDA
approval of the generic‚Äôs ANDA.  The data
also do not indicate that court decisions in
ANDA-related patent litigation typically are
reached much earlier than 30 months from
notice of the generic‚Äôs ANDA.
The expiration of the 30-month stay
may have more significance in the future, if
ANDA-related patent litigation begins to last
longer than was the case from 1992-2000. 
Generic applicants may rely on expiration of
the 30-month stay more frequently as the
first point at which they may decide whether
to enter the market, rather than to wait for a
court decision on ANDA-related patent
litigation that may take longer than 30
months. 
The history thus far of multiple 30-
month stays caused by the filing of later-
issued patents appears problematic,
however.  The 4 courts that have ruled so far
on the patents causing more than one 30-
month stay each have found the relevant
patent to be invalid or not infringed.  The
other 4 drug products with multiple 30-
month stays involved patents whose listing
in the Orange Book could have been the
subject of non-frivolous challenges by the
generic applicant, had either FDA review of
listability or a private right of action to
challenge listability under Hatch-Waxman
been available.
Multiple 30-month stays prevented
FDA approval of the generic applicants‚Äô
ANDAs for 4 to 40 months beyond the
initial 30-month period.  FDA approval may
have occurred more quickly in the absence
of the multiple 30-month stays, because the
data indicate that FDA approval has
occurred, on average, within 25 months and
15 days for generic applicants with
paragraph IV certifications that were not
sued.
Even without an additional 30-month
stay, later-listed patents still receive the
usual protections of patent infringement
litigation.  The brand-name company may
sue for patent infringement with respect to
any of its patents that it believes may be
v
infringed by a generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA,
and may seek a preliminary injunction, just
as other patent holders do against alleged
infringers.5
One minor change to the patent
statute, which would clarify when brand-
name companies can sue generic applicants
for patent infringement, would ensure that
brand-name companies have recourse to the
courts to protect their rights under later-
issued patents.  Congress may wish to
overrule a recent district court decision,
Allergan, Inc. v. Alcon Labs, Inc., 200 F.
Supp. 2d 1219 (C.D. Cal. 2002), which
questions the rights of brand-name
companies to sue for patent infringement
regarding patents obtained or listed after an
ANDA with a paragraph IV has been filed. 
Under the plain language of 35 U.S.C.
¬ß 271(e)(2), however,  all ANDAs constitute
acts of infringement sufficient to establish
the existence of a case or controversy with
respect to all patents that claim any drug or
any method of using the drug that may be
infringed by generic marketing under an
ANDA ‚Äì regardless of whether the patent
has been listed in the Orange Book or has
been the subject of a paragraph IV ANDA
(as opposed to a different kind of ANDA). 
To permit only one 30-month stay
per drug product per ANDA6 should
eliminate most of the potential for improper
Orange Book listings to generate 
unwarranted 30-month stays.  However, it
should be noted that, currently, the FDA
does not review the propriety of patents
listed in the Orange Book, and courts have
ruled that generic applicants have no private
right of action to challenge those listings. 
As a result, there is no mechanism to delist
an improperly listed patent from the Orange
Book.  The lack of such a mechanism may
have real world consequences in that the
Commission is aware of at least a few
instances in which a 30-month stay was
generated solely by a patent that raised
legitimate listability questions. 
There have been various suggestions
to address this situation, each with its own
pros and cons.  One proposal has been to
establish an administrative procedure
through which generic applicants could
obtain substantive FDA review of listability. 
The FDA, however, has taken the position
that it lacks the expertise and resources
necessary to perform such a review, and its
solely ministerial review of Orange Book
listings has been upheld by the courts.  At a
minimum, it appears useful for the FDA to
clarify its listing requirements (see
Appendix H).
Another remedy that may warrant
consideration would permit a generic
applicant to raise listability issues as a
counterclaim in the context of patent
infringement litigation already initiated by
the brand-name company in response to a
paragraph IV notice from the generic
applicant.  This would permit resolution of
the issue in the same district court
proceeding in which other aspects of the
relevant patents were at issue.  It remains
unclear how frequently such a provision
5 Thus, the usual patent protections would remain
for brand-name companies whose patents may be listed in
the Orange Book after the filing of a generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA solely because it took a long time for the Patent
Office to issue the patent.
6 This would be applied only to resolve
infringement disputes over patents listed in the Orange
Book prior to the filing date of the generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA.
vi
would be used.  
Recommendation 2:  Pass legislation to
require brand-name companies and
first generic applicants to provide
copies of certain agreements to the
Federal Trade Commission.  
The Current 180-Day Marketing
Exclusivity Provision:  The first generic
applicant to file an ANDA containing a
paragraph IV certification is awarded 180
days of marketing exclusivity, during which
the FDA may not approve a subsequent
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA for the same drug
product.  The 180-day exclusivity period is
calculated from either the date of the first
commercial marketing of the generic drug
product or the date of a court decision
declaring the patent invalid or not infringed,
whichever is sooner.  Through this 180-day
provision, Hatch-Waxman provides an
incentive for companies to challenge patent
validity and to ‚Äúdesign around‚Äù patents to
find alternative, non-infringing forms of
patented drugs.  The 180-day marketing
exclusivity provision was intended to
increase the economic incentives for a
generic company to be the first to file an
ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification and get to market.
Key Facts From the Study:
How Frequently Has FDA Granted 180-
Day Exclusivity?
The regulatory landscape
implementing 180-day exclusivity has
shifted over the last several years.  Before
1992 (a time period not included in this
study), the FDA granted 180-day exclusivity
to 3 generic applicants.  From 1992 until
1998, the FDA did not grant 180-day
exclusivity to any generic applicant.  Since
1998, when the FDA changed its regulations
in response to a court ruling, and more
ANDAs containing paragraph IV
certifications have been filed, the FDA has
granted 180-day exclusivity to the first
generic applicant for 31 drug products. 
Thus, the 180-day exclusivity has been
granted for 31 out of the 104 drug products
for which a first generic applicant filed an
ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification from 1992 through 2000.
Has the 180-Days Exclusivity Been
Triggered Most Often by a Court Decision
or by the First Generic‚Äôs Commercial
Marketing? 
For 19 of the 31 drug products,
commercial marketing triggered the running
of the first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day
exclusivity.7  For the other 12 drug products,
a court decision favorable to the generic
applicant triggered the 180-day exclusivity.
 
How Have Generic Applicants Fared in
Patent Infringement Litigation?
   
Generic applicants have prevailed in
73 percent of the cases in which a court has
resolved the patent dispute.8  The rate at
7 The data further indicate that, when not sued,
first generic applicants begin commercial marketing, after
receiving FDA approval, in a timely manner that triggers
the running of the 180 days and thus would allow FDA
approval of subsequent eligible generic applicants once the
180 days has run. 
8 These statistics include other cases in addition
to those involving the 12 drug products where a court
decision triggered the 180-day exclusivity.  For example,
during a time when FDA did not consider a district court
decision sufficient to trigger the 180-day exclusivity, some
generic applicants began commercial marketing following
vii
which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit reversed district court
decisions of patent invalidity and non-
infringement for drug products in this study
was 8 percent.
When Did Generic Applicants Enter the
Market?
In most instances, generic applicants
have waited to enter the market until at least
a district court has held that the patent
covering the brand-name company‚Äôs drug
product was invalid or not infringed by the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA.
Are There Circumstances in which the
180-Day Exclusivity Has Been ‚ÄúParked‚Äù
For Some Period of Time, So That the
First Generic Applicant Does Not Trigger
It, and FDA Approval of Any Subsequent
Eligible Generic Applicant Would Be
Precluded?
 Yes.  During the time period of the
study, there were 20 final settlements of
ANDA-related patent litigation.  Fourteen of
the 20,9 at the time they were executed, had
the potential to delay the start of the first
generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity.10  If
the 180-day exclusivity for the first generic
applicant does not run, then the FDA may
not approve any subsequent eligible generic
applicants.  Once the 180-day exclusivity
runs, the FDA may approve any additional
generic ANDAs that have been filed and
meet regulatory requirements. 
Under 2 of these 14 settlement
agreements, the first generic applicant did
begin commercial marketing, but each
generic was marketing the brand-name
company‚Äôs product as a generic ‚Äì neither
was marketing under its own ANDA.  As
discussed in more detail below, it is unclear
whether this type of ‚Äúcommercial
marketing‚Äù is sufficient to trigger the
running of the 180-day exclusivity.  
In addition to the 20 final settlement
agreements, there were 4 interim settlement
agreements pursuant to which the patent
litigation continued, but the parties agreed
upon certain conditions in the meantime. 
The Commission has challenged interim
settlements for 3 drug products.11  In those
agreements, the Commission alleged that the
brand-name drug company paid the first
generic applicant not to enter the market,
thereby retaining its (unused) 180-day
marketing exclusivity and precluding FDA
from approving any eligible subsequent
generic applicants.  
Have Such Agreements Continued
Following FTC Enforcement Action in this
Area?
Between April 1999 (shortly after
FTC investigations in this area became
expiration of the 30-month stay and a favorable decision of
a district court.  In each of these instances, the generic
applicant ultimately prevailed in the appellate court, but
commercial marketing, not the district court decision,
triggered the 180-day exclusivity.
9 Ten brand-name companies and 10 generic
companies used these types of agreements with respect
to14 drug products.
10 In some cases, this delay did not occur due to
subsequent events.

public) and the end of the period covered by
this study, brand-name companies and first
generic applicants have not entered
agreements similar to the interim agreements
challenged by the FTC.
Reasons for the Recommendation:  
The data in the study suggest that the
generic applicants have brought appropriate
patent challenges:  generic applicants
prevailed in nearly 75% of the patent
litigation ultimately resolved by a court
decision.12  Moreover, most generic
applicants have waited to enter the market
until at least a district court has held that the
patent covering the brand-name company‚Äôs
drug product was invalid or not infringed by
the ANDA.  This may reflect the fact that a
generic applicant‚Äôs potential liability for lost
profits on the brand-name drug usually will
vastly exceed its own potential profits after
market entry.
The data also indicate that, when not
sued, first generic applicants, upon receiving
FDA approval, begin commercial marketing
in a timely manner that triggers the running
of the 180 days and allows FDA approval of
any subsequent eligible generic applicant
once the 180 days has run.  Thus, the data
suggest that, in and of itself, the 180-day
exclusivity provision generally has not
created a bottleneck to prevent FDA
approval of subsequent eligible generic
applicants.
Require Brand-Name Companies and First
Generic Applicants to Provide Copies of
Certain Agreements to the Federal Trade
Commission 
Issues that merit antitrust scrutiny,
however, may arise when brand-name
companies and first generic applicants reach
agreements that have the potential to ‚Äúpark‚Äù
the first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day
exclusivity for some period of time. 
Fourteen of the 20 final settlement
agreements obtained through the study had
this potential as of the time they were
executed.  Such agreements may be
procompetitive or competitively neutral. 
But they also may raise antitrust issues, as
was alleged to be the case in the interim
settlement agreements the FTC challenged.
Given this history, we believe that
notification of such agreements to the
Federal Trade Commission and the U.S.
Department of Justice is warranted.  We
support the Drug Competition Act of 2001
(S. 754) introduced by Senator Leahy, as
reported by the Committee on the Judiciary,
which would require that if a brand-name
company and a generic applicant enter into
an agreement that relates in any way to the
180-day exclusivity or which concerns the
manufacture, marketing, or sale of either the
brand name drug or its generic equivalent,
then both companies must file a copy of the
agreement (or a complete written summary
of any oral agreement), along with copies of
any other related agreements, with the
Commission and the Department of Justice.
Minor Recommendations to the 180-Day
Exclusivity Provision:
It is unclear whether a few types of
12 The data do not establish, however, whether
even more appropriate patent challenges might have been
brought if the period of generic market exclusivity was
longer than 180 days.
ix
factual circumstances trigger the running the
180-day exclusivity.  Three minor changes
would clarify that these circumstances
should trigger the 180-day exclusivity and
thus reduce any potential for the 180-day
marketing exclusivity provision to function
as a bottleneck to subsequent generic entry.
Minor Recommendation 1:  Clarify that
‚Äúcommercial marketing‚Äù includes the first
generic applicant‚Äôs marketing of the brand-
name product.
The data revealed 2 instances when
the brand-name company and the first
generic applicant settled the patent
infringement lawsuit with a supply
agreement, and 3 other instances in which an
optional supply agreement was one part of a
patent settlement.  In all instances, the
agreements contemplated that the brand-
name company would supply the generic
applicant with the brand-name drug product,
so that the generic applicant could market it
as a generic version.  Currently, it is
somewhat unclear whether marketing of the
brand-name product by the first generic
applicant constitutes ‚Äúcommercial
marketing‚Äù sufficient to trigger the 180-day
exclusivity.13
To avoid situations in which the
running of the 180 days is not triggered
because of this uncertainty, it would be
desirable to clarify that ‚Äúcommercial
marketing‚Äù includes any marketing by the
first generic applicant, even under a supply
agreement with the brand-name company. 
In some circumstances, such commercial
marketing may be the only event that can
trigger the running of the 180-day
exclusivity.  For example, if there is a
second generic applicant, but it is not sued
by the brand-name company, then there will
not be a court decision to trigger the 180
days, and only the first generic applicant‚Äôs
commercial marketing under the supply
agreement could start the running of the 180
days and thus, after 180 days, free the FDA
to approve any eligible subsequent generic
applicants.   
Minor Recommendation 2:  Codify that the
decision of any court on the same patent
being litigated by the first generic applicant
constitutes a ‚Äúcourt decision‚Äù sufficient to
start the running of the 180-day exclusivity.
There is some question as to which
court‚Äôs decision is sufficient to activate the
‚Äúcourt decision‚Äù trigger of the 180-day
exclusivity.  Two courts of appeal have
held,14 and the FDA has issued guidance, 15
that any court‚Äôs decision on whether the
13 In response to a citizen petition involving the
30 mg strength of Procardia XL, the FDA determined that
the first generic applicant was ineligible for 180-day
exclusivity, because the generic applicant and the brand-
name company had settled their patent litigation and
effectively changed the generic applicant‚Äôs certification
from a paragraph IV to a paragraph III.  In addition, and
under alternative reasoning, the FDA determined that even
if the first generic applicant was eligible for the 180-day
exclusivity, that exclusivity already had been triggered by
the generic applicant‚Äôs marketing under a supply agreement
with the brand-name company.  See FDA Letter to Deborah
A. Jaskot, Docket No. OPP-1446/CP1 (Feb. 6, 2001).  This
letter leaves  somewhat unclear whether a supply agreement
alone would be sufficient to satisfy the commercial
marketing trigger for the 180-day exclusivity.  See, also,
Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Tommy G. Thompson,
2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24234 (N.D. WV Apr. 18, 2001).

patent at issue is invalid or not infringed is
sufficient to trigger the running of the first
generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity.
On balance, we believe this is the
correct result, but there are pros and cons. 
On the one hand, the rule would make it less
likely that agreements between brand-name
and generic companies that had the effect of 
‚Äúparking‚Äù the 180-day exclusivity for some
period of time could forestall FDA approval
of a subsequent eligible generic applicant. 
This is because, if the brand-name company
sues the second (or later) generic applicant,
and that generic applicant won its patent
litigation, then the 180-day exclusivity of the
first generic applicant would begin to run
from the date of the later generic applicant‚Äôs
favorable court decision.  Such
circumstances may arise; the data showed
that brand-name companies sued later
generic applicants in nearly 85% of the
cases.  The rule would be consistent with the
mandate in the legislative history of Hatch-
Waxman to ‚Äúmake available more low-cost
drugs,‚Äù16 because the rule would assist in
eliminating potential bottlenecks to FDA
approval of subsequent eligible generic
applicants.
 
Such a rule also could speed generic
entry when the second generic applicant‚Äôs
lawsuit is resolved prior to that of the first
applicant.  This appears to be appropriate
given the low reversal rate of district court
opinions of patent invalidity and non-
infringement.  For example, under this rule,
if both the first and second generic
applicants are sued, but the court hearing the
second generic applicant‚Äôs case is the first to
arrive at a decision, then that court‚Äôs
decision would trigger the running of the
first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity,
regardless of whether the first generic
applicant had received FDA approval.  The
data revealed 1 such case.
On the other hand, as illustrated in
the preceding paragraph, the operation of
this rule could deprive the first generic
applicant of its ability to market under the
180-days exclusivity, even though the first
generic applicant had been diligently
pursuing resolution of its patent litigation. 
This result could dampen the incentive to
become the first generic applicant.17 
Moreover, if the later court issues a non-
infringement decision, the reasoning
underlying the holding may not apply to the
first generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA, depending
upon the facts of the case. 
Minor Recommendation 3:  Clarify that a
court decision dismissing a declaratory
judgment action for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction constitutes a ‚Äúcourt decision‚Äù
sufficient to trigger the 180-day exclusivity.
One court of appeals has held that a
dismissal of a declaratory judgment action
for lack of a case or controversy is a ‚Äúcourt
decision‚Äù of non-infringement sufficient to
trigger the 180-day exclusivity.18  We
believe that the court‚Äôs reasoning is
persuasive and should be adopted.  
16 H.R.Rep. No. 98-857, pt. 1, 98th Cong., 2d
Sess., at 14 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2647,
2647.
17 By contrast, the absence of such a rule also
could dampen the incentive for later generic applicants to
develop eligible ANDAs containing paragraph IV
certifications.  
18 Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. v. FDA, 182
F.3d 1003 (D. C. Cir 1999).
xi
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia confronted a situation
in which the brand-name company did not
sue any of the generic applicants for patent
infringement, presumably because the brand-
name company‚Äôs patents were not infringed
by the ANDA.  To trigger the first generic
applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity (because it
had not yet been approved by the FDA), the
second generic applicant sought a
declaratory judgment that its ANDA did not
infringe the brand-name product‚Äôs patents. 
The district court hearing the case dismissed
the lawsuit for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, because the brand-name
company indicated that it would not sue the
second generic applicant for patent
infringement, thus eliminating its reasonable
apprehension of a patent infringement suit
and the existence of a case or controversy. 
This dismissal also estopped the brand-name
company from suing the generic applicant in
the future.
The Court of Appeals determined
that the dismissal for lack of case or
controversy was, in fact, a court decision,
because the brand-name company indicated
that the second generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA
did not infringe the relevant patent.  As a
result, the dismissal activated the court
decision trigger.  Such a rule eliminates the
potential for a bottleneck created by a first
generic applicant that does not exercise its
commercial marketing rights.

Chapter 1  Introduction and Background
Introduction
In April 2001, the Commission
began an industry-wide study focused on
certain aspects of generic drug competition
under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.1 
The Amendments provide certain methods
by which generic drug manufacturers can
obtain approval to market a generic version
of a brand-name product.  The study‚Äôs
purpose was to provide a more complete
picture of how generic drug competition has
developed under one method the
Amendments established:  generic entry
prior to expiration of the brand-name
company‚Äôs patents on the relevant drug
product.2  This report sets forth the results of
the study.3
The study was prompted, in part, by
the Commission‚Äôs enforcement actions
against alleged anticompetitive agreements
that relied on certain Hatch-Waxman
provisions.4  The study was designed to
determine whether such agreements are
isolated instances or more typical, and
whether particular provisions of the Hatch-
Waxman Amendments are susceptible to
strategies to delay or deter consumer access
to low-cost generic alternatives to brand-
name drug products.
The study also was requested by
Representative Henry Waxman, one of the
co-sponsors of Hatch-Waxman, who asked
the FTC to ‚Äúinvestigate and produce a study
on the use of agreements between and
among pharmaceutical companies and
potential generic competitors and any other
strategies that may delay generic drug
competition throughout the U.S.‚Äù  Other
members of Congress have proposed
legislation to amend various portions of
Hatch-Waxman, including the sections that

Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984)
(codified as amended 21 U.S.C. ' 355 (1994)).
2 The study did not examine how generic
competition has developed under the other methods the
Amendments established.  Nor did the study examine
whether Hatch-Waxman provisions have achieved another
purpose of the Amendments:  to compensate brand-name
companies for lost patent life due to the time needed for
FDA‚Äôs safety and efficacy review process.
3 Appendix A contains a glossary of frequently
used terms and their meanings under Hatch-Waxman.

order), available

same issues are raised by another case in which the
Commission settled similar allegations, see American
Home Products, Docket No. 9297 (Feb. 19, 2002) (decision
and order) available at
<http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/02/ahpdo.pdf>.   See also

Decision (Jul. 2, 2002), available at
<http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/07/scheringinitialdecisionp1.
pdf>.  The Commission also has accepted for public
comment a consent order settling charges that Biovail
illegally acquired an exclusive patent license and
wrongfully listed that patent pursuant to another provision
of the FDA‚Äôs regulations implementing Hatch-Waxman.

Consent Order, (Apr. 19, 2002), available at

Moreover, the Commission has accepted for public
comment a consent order settling charges that Elan and
Biovail entered into a supply and distribution agreement
for a generic drug product that may have unreasonably
restrained their incentives to compete against each other.

are the subject of the Commission‚Äôs study.5 
 Finally, the study was motivated, in
part, by the prospect of a substantial sales
volume of brand-name drug products
coming off patent in the next several years.6 
This represents an enormous opportunity for
the generic drug industry and, conceivably,
a commensurate threat to the brand-name
pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name
pharmaceutical drug manufacturers seeking
to protect the sales of brand-name drugs
may have an incentive and ability to enter
into agreements with would-be generic
competitors, or engage in other types of
activities, that would slow or thwart the
entry of competing generic drug products. 
The Commission has developed
significant expertise regarding competition
in the pharmaceutical industry.  The
Commission has, for example, brought
antitrust enforcement actions affecting both
brand-name and generic drug
manufacturers.7  Commission staff have
conducted empirical analyses of competition
in the pharmaceutical industry, including in-
depth studies by the staff of the Bureau of
Economics.8  The Commission has provided
testimony before Congress,9 and
Commission staff have filed comments with
the Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù)
regarding competitive aspects of Hatch-
Waxman implementation.10  In addition,
individual Commissioners have addressed
the subject of pharmaceutical competition
before a variety of audiences, both to solicit
input from affected parties and to promote
dialogue regarding practical solutions.11

In October 2000, the Commission
began the formal process of obtaining
authorization to conduct this study.  As
required by the Paperwork Reduction Act
and implementing regulations of the Office
of Management and Budget,12 the
Commission published a Federal Register
notice13 that included, among other things,
the special orders under Section 6(b) of the
Federal Trade Commission Act14 that the
Commission planned to serve on brand-
name pharmaceutical companies and generic
drug manufacturers.
In response to the public comments
received following this Federal Register
notice, the Commission clarified the
proposed information requests as suggested
by several parties and published in March
2001 a second notice requesting public
comments.15  On April 6, 2001, the
Commission obtained OMB approval to
conduct the study, and on April 25, 2001,
the Commission began service of the special
orders on 28 brand-name companies and
over 50 generic drug companies.16  By
December 31, 2001, the Commission had
received substantial compliance with the
special orders.
Overview of the Hatch-
Waxman Act and the FDA‚Äôs
Implementing Regulations
Before describing the scope of the
study, it is important to understand the
historical context in which Hatch-Waxman
arose.  Moreover, the generic approval
process Hatch-Waxman implemented
demands an understanding of the interaction
of the patent system and the regulatory
structure governing the approval of brand-
name drugs.  
Pre-Hatch-Waxman Regulatory
Environment
In 1962, amendments to the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act added a
proof-of-efficacy requirement to new drug
approvals; before that time, the FDA
approved drugs for safety only.  As a result
of the amendments, brand-name companies
are required to prove that new drugs are safe
and effective prior to FDA approval.  To
prove safety and efficacy, brand-name
companies are required to conduct tests on
humans (‚Äúclinical trials‚Äù) and to submit
those results to the FDA with their new drug
application (NDA).  
Those seeking to market a generic
version of an existing post-1962 brand-name
drug also had to perform their own safety
and efficacy studies, much like the brand-
name companies had to demonstrate the
safety and efficacy of the brand-name
drug.17  The FDA did not have a streamlined
Intellectual Property Policy: The Way Ahead, at 5-6 (Nov.
15, 2001) available at
<http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/muris/intellectual.htm>. 
12 The Commission was required to obtain OMB
clearance before it could begin the study because the
number of special orders to be sent triggered the
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44
U.S.C. Ch. 35, as amended. 
13 See 65 Fed. Reg. 61334 (Oct. 17, 2000).
14 15 U.S.C. ' 46(b).
15 See 66 Fed. Reg. 12512 (Feb. 27, 2001). 
16 Several brand-name drug companies have
equity interests in generic subsidiaries and, thus, were
requested to answer questions relating to both brand-name
products and generic products.
17 The FDA considered ‚Äúsuch retesting to be
unnecessary and wasteful because the drug [had] already
been determined to be safe and effective.  Moreover, such
4
procedure by which to approve generic
versions of brand-name drug products
whose patents had expired.18  By 1984, the
FDA estimated that there were
approximately 150 brand-name drugs whose
patents had expired for which there was no
generic equivalent.19 
Another factor complicating generic
drug approval concerned the timing of when
generic companies could perform their
clinical tests.  Before Hatch-Waxman was
enacted, a generic company could not begin
the required FDA approval process until
after patents on the relevant brand-name
product had expired; to begin earlier would
typically have infringed the brand-name
company‚Äôs patents.20  Thus, at that time,
patent law coupled with the FDA generic
approval process, in effect, extended the
term of the brand-name company‚Äôs patent
protection and delayed market entry by
generic versions of brand-name
pharmaceutical drug products. 
Brand-name pharmaceutical
companies also confronted problems.  The
discovery and development of new drug
products are expensive and time-
consuming.21  To spur this investment, as
well as to recoup investments made, brand-
name companies obtain patent protection to
exclude others from making, using, or
selling an invention for a number of years. 
Often, however, the brand-name companies
obtained patents prior to FDA approval of
the drug product.  Thus, the effective terms
of many patents were shortened due to the
time required for the FDA to ensure the
safety and efficacy of the brand-name
company‚Äôs drug product.
The Hatch-Waxman
 Amendments
Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments to address both issues.22  To
enable earlier generic entry, the
Amendments provided that certain conduct
related to obtaining FDA approval that
would otherwise constitute patent
infringement would be exempt from
infringement liability under the patent laws. 
In addition, generic applicants were
permitted to rely on the brand-name
company‚Äôs trade secret data demonstrating
the safety and efficacy of the brand-name
drug product.  To restore patent protection
to brand-name companies to compensate
them for the time used to obtain FDA
approval, the Amendments contained
provisions to extend patent terms in certain
circumstances. 
Thus, Hatch-Waxman balanced an
expedited FDA approval process to speed
generic entry with patent term restoration to
retesting is unethical because it requires that some sick
patients take placebos and be denied treatment known to be
effective.‚Äù  See H.R. Rep. No. 98-857, Part I at 16 (1984),
reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2647, 2649.
18 The FDA did establish, however, a procedure
to determine the effectiveness of all drugs approved prior
to 1962, and it established a policy of permitting the
approval of a generic equivalent to a safe and effective pre-
1962 brand-name drug.  This generic approval procedure,
however, did not apply to drugs approved after 1962.  Id.

ensure continuing innovation.  As one
federal appellate judge explained, the
Amendments ‚Äúemerged from Congress‚Äôs
efforts to balance two conflicting policy
objectives:  to induce brand-name
pharmaceutical firms to make the
investments necessary to research and
develop new drug products, while
simultaneously enabling competitors to
bring cheaper, generic copies of those drugs
to market.‚Äù23
Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, a brand-name company
seeking to market a new drug product must
first obtain FDA approval by filing a New
Drug Application (NDA).  The NDA
ultimately must include a variety of
information that is extremely expensive and
time-consuming to develop, including
clinical trial data.  
When the NDA is filed, the NDA
filer also must provide the FDA with certain
categories of information regarding the
patents that cover the drug that is the subject
of its NDA.24  Upon approval of the NDA,
the FDA lists the patents in an agency
publication entitled ‚ÄúApproved Drug
Products with Therapeutic Equivalence,‚Äù
commonly known as the ‚ÄúOrange Book.‚Äù25 
In addition to patents on the active
ingredient in a drug product, patents on
specific formulations (i.e., a tablet form) or
methods of use (i.e., used to treat heartburn
in mammals) of the drug product are also
listed in the Orange Book.
Rather than requiring a generic
manufacturer to repeat the costly and time-
consuming NDA process, the Amendments
permit the company to file an Abbreviated
New Drug Application (‚ÄúANDA‚Äù).  The
object of the ANDA process is to
demonstrate that the generic drug product
has the same active ingredient, route of
administration, dosage form and strength,
and proposed labeling as the brand-name
drug.  The ANDA also must contain
sufficient information to demonstrate that
the generic drug is ‚Äúbioequivalent‚Äù to the
relevant brand-name product.26  As a result
of providing this information, the generic
applicant is allowed to rely on the FDA‚Äôs
previous findings of safety and effectiveness
for the referenced brand-name drug, and
thus the applicant does not have to provide
its own clinical studies to demonstrate the
generic drug product‚Äôs safety and
effectiveness.  This reliance on the
innovator‚Äôs safety and efficacy data allows
generic applicants to save very substantial
amounts of money in development costs.
An ANDA also must contain a
certification regarding each patent listed in
the Orange Book that relates to the relevant
NDA for which the generic applicant is
seeking to make a generic version.  The
statute provides ANDA applicants with four
certification options:  they may certify (I)
that the required patent information has not
been filed; (II) that the patent has expired;
(III) that the patent has not expired, but will
expire on a particular date and approval is
sought after patent expiration; or (IV) that
the patent is invalid or will not be infringed
by the generic drug for which the ANDA

NDA filer29 with a detailed statement of the
factual and legal basis for the ANDA filer‚Äôs
assertion that the patent is invalid or not
infringed.  Once the ANDA filer has
provided such notice, a patent holder
(usually the brand-name company) must
bring an infringement suit within 45 days to
take advantage of the statutory stay
provision.30  If the patent holder does not
bring suit within 45 days, the FDA approval
process may proceed, and the FDA may
approve an ANDA as soon as regulatory
requirements are fulfilled.31  A 30-month
stay of FDA approval of an ANDA
applicant is invoked when a brand-name
company receives notice of a generic
applicant‚Äôs paragraph IV certification and
files suit for patent infringement within 45
days of that notice.32  Filing of the lawsuit
stays the FDA‚Äôs approval of the ANDA until
the earliest of:  (1) the date the patent(s)
expire; (2) a final determination of
non-infringement or patent invalidity by a
court in the patent litigation; or (3) the
expiration of 30 months from the receipt of
notice of the paragraph IV certification.
The second provision is the ‚Äú180-day
period of exclusivity.‚Äù  The first generic
applicant to file an ANDA containing a
paragraph IV certification is eligible for 180
days of marketing exclusivity, during which
the FDA may not approve subsequent
ANDAs for the same drug product.33  The
180-day exclusivity period thus increases
the economic incentives for a generic
company to be the first to file an ANDA
containing a paragraph IV certification. 
Through this 180-day provision, the
Amendments also provide an incentive for
generic companies to litigate patents that
may be invalid and to ‚Äúdesign around‚Äù
patents to find alternative, non-infringing
forms of patented drugs.34  The 180-day
exclusivity period is calculated from either
the date of the first commercial marketing of
the generic drug product or the date of a
court decision declaring the patent invalid or
not infringed, whichever is sooner.35  After
the 180 days, other generic products can
enter the market, provided they obtain the
FDA regulatory approval.  Subsequent
eligible generic applicants must wait until
the first generic applicant‚Äôs 180 days have
run before the FDA can approve the
subsequent ANDA.
Figure 1-2 describes graphically how
the 30-month stay and 180-day exclusivity
provisions affect FDA approval of a generic
applicant‚Äôs ANDA.
29 Id. at ' 355(j)(2)(B).  Although the patent
holder and the NDA filer are often the same person, this is
not always the case.  The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
require that all patents that claim the drug described in an
NDA must be listed in the Orange Book.  Occasionally,
this requires an NDA filer to list a patent that it does not
own.

Price Effect of Generic Entry
Because generic drugs are typically
far less expensive than their corresponding
brand-name versions, competition from
generic drugs can deliver large savings to
consumers.  A Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) study attempted to quantify the
magnitude of this effect by analyzing retail
pharmacy data from 1993 and 1994.  The
study found that, for drugs that are available
in both generic and brand-name versions,
the average price of a generic prescription
was approximately half of the average price
of a brand-name prescription.36  The CBO
estimated that, in 1994, the availability of
generic drugs saved purchasers between $8
billion and $10 billion.37
The broader empirical economics
literature also points to a number of
competitive effects associated with the
introduction of generic drugs.  Early
research using small data samples with
information on brand name and generic
prescription drug prices and sales found that
(1) brand name drug prices rose slightly, but
that average drug prices declined some 20
percent within approximately two years of
generic entry,38 and (2) generic entry
produces slight reductions in brand name
drug prices and declines in generic prices as
the number of generic rivals increases.39  
A more recent study of 32 drugs that
lost patent protection around the time of the
passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
found that generic entry results in somewhat
higher prices for brand-name prescription
drugs (in light of factors such as inelastic
demand among users of brand-name
products), but large decreases in the prices
of corresponding generic drugs.40  Another
recent study of 32 drugs that lost patent
protection after passage of the Hatch-
Waxman found that generic drug prices fell
until at least the fifth generic firm enters,
and that falling prices from increased
competition can continue with the entry of
additional generic competitors.41  It is also
noteworthy that elements of this literature
indicate that generic entrants gain
significant market share at the expense of
their rival brand name drug companies after
their entry.  Overall, this literature points to
significant short-run competitive impacts of
generic entry that can lead to substantial
benefits for consumers of prescription drugs.

generic competition for those brand-name
drug products (1) subject to an ANDA
notice containing a paragraph IV
certification (2) that brand-name companies
received after January 1, 1992 and prior to
January 1, 2001.  By focusing on these
brand-name drug products, the study could
examine how the 180-day marketing
exclusivity and the 30-month stay
provisions have influenced the development
of generic drug competition. 
The study does not address how
generic competition has developed under
paragraph I, II, or III certifications.  The
study also does not address the patent
restoration features of Hatch-Waxman. 
ANDAs Under Hatch-Waxman
According to the FDA, from the time
Hatch-Waxman became effective in 1984
through December 31, 2000, 8,019 ANDAs
were filed with the FDA.42  Of these
applications, 7,536 (94 percent) raised no
patent issues (i.e., the ANDAs did not
contain a paragraph IV certification).  A
substantial portion of the total number of
ANDAs, however, relate to the same brand-
name product or NDA.  Thus, the total
number of ANDAs does not represent 8,019
unique brand-name drug products, and it is
unclear as to how many unique brand-name
drug products the total 8,019 ANDAs
related.
Four hundred eighty-three (483) (or
six percent of the total number of ANDAs
filed) contained Paragraph IV certifications. 
The 483 ANDAs relate to 130 unique brand-
name drug products as measured by unique
NDAs. The share of ANDAs with paragraph
IV certifications ‚Äì compared to all ANDAs
filed (those with paragraph I-IV
certifications) -- has increased significantly
since Hatch-Waxman was enacted. 
According to the data provided by the FDA,
during the 1980s (1984-89), only 2 percent
of ANDAs contained paragraph IV
certifications.  This share increased to
approximately 12 percent for the 1990s, and
it has increased substantially in the last few
years:  from 1998-2000, approximately 20
percent of ANDAs contained paragraph IV
certifications. 
The brand-name drug products this
study covered include any drug product for
which the brand-name company received
notification of an ANDA containing a
paragraph IV certification after January 1,
1992 and prior to January 1, 2001.43  This
selection criteria resulted in 104 drug
products, as represented by New Drug
Applications (NDAs) filed with the FDA,
within the scope of the study.  As noted
previously, from 1984 to January 2001, 130
unique NDAs were subject to at least one
ANDA with a paragraph IV certification. 
The most recent 104 brand-name drug
products (of the 130 total) are included
within the scope of the study.
Appendix C contains a list of the
NDAs within the scope of the study.  The
drug products included in the study
represent some of the largest drug products
as measured by annual sales, including so-
called ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drugs such as Capoten,
Cardizem CD, Cipro, Claritin, Lupron

ANDA with the requisite certification after January 1,
1992, even if the first generic applicant for a particular
drug product filed its application prior to January 1, 1992,
the drug product was included within the scope of the
study.

The FDA provided the Commission
with the identity of the generic companies
that have filed ANDAs containing paragraph
IV certifications since enactment of Hatch-
Waxman in 1984.  Using this information,
FTC staff identified which brand-name
companies had received notice of the filing
of an ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification.  The list of brand-name
companies and generic companies are
attached as Appendix D.  Special orders
were served on all identified brand-name
companies who received notice of, and on
the first three generic drug companies who
had filed, the ANDA.44  
The FTC‚Äôs special orders required
the brand-name companies to produce
agreements with generic applicants that
relate to the ANDA filing, results of ANDA
patent infringement litigation with generic
applicants, listing of patents in the FDA‚Äôs
Orange Book, sales information, and the use
of citizen petitions.  Generic applicants were
required to produce agreements relating to
the innovator‚Äôs drug products for which they
had filed an ANDA containing a paragraph
IV certification, and to respond to questions
about the results of patent infringement
litigation with the brand-name company,
sharing of litigation expenses with other
generic applicants, allegations of improper
Orange Book listings, and sales information.

Chapter 2  Outcomes of Patent Infringement Lawsuits Under the
 Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Introduction
The application of both the 180-day
exclusivity and 30-month stay provisions
depends, at least in part, upon whether the
brand-name company initiates patent
infringement litigation against a generic
applicant.1  As noted earlier, the 180-day
exclusivity provision grants, under certain
circumstances, 180 days of exclusive
marketing to the first generic applicant that
files an ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification.  A 30-month stay of FDA
approval of a potential generic competitor is
invoked if a brand-name company receives
notice of a generic applicant‚Äôs paragraph IV
certification and files suit for patent
infringement within 45 days of that notice. 
Filing of the lawsuit stays the FDA‚Äôs
approval of the ANDA until the earliest of:
(1) the date the patents expire; (2) a final
determination of non-infringement or patent
invalidity by a court in the patent litigation;
or (3) the expiration of 30 months from the
receipt of notice of the paragraph IV
certification.  This chapter reviews the
frequency and outcome of these patent
infringement lawsuits.
For nearly 75 percent of drug
products this study covered, brand-name
companies initiated patent infringement
litigation against the first generic applicant. 
In the other 25 percent, there was no suit,
and the FDA has approved most of the
generic products, thus allowing generic entry
to occur.  FDA approval of ANDAs
submitted by first generic applicants who
were not sued by the brand-name company
took, on average, 24 months and 2 weeks
from the ANDA filing date.
In 70 percent of the cases in which
the brand-name company sued the first
generic applicant, there has been either a
court decision, or the parties have agreed to
a final settlement.  Of these lawsuits,
involving 53 drug products, 20 settled
without a court decision on the merits of the
patent infringement lawsuit.  These
settlement agreements are discussed in detail
in Chapter 3.  In the other 30 percent of the
cases, a district court had not yet ruled as of
June 1, 2002.  
Of all the patent infringement cases
(including first and subsequent generic
applicants) in which there has been a
decision of a court as of June 1, 2002,
generic applicants prevailed in 73 percent of
the cases, and brand-name companies
prevailed in 27 percent.  Of the decisions
favoring the generic applicant, there were
slightly more non-infringement decisions
(14) than patent invalidity decisions (11). 
The rate at which the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit overturned district
court decisions of patent invalidity for drug
products in this study was 8 percent.
In most instances when the 30-month

‚Äúgeneric applicant‚Äù means those applicants who have filed
an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification.  See
Appendix A for a glossary of frequently used terms.
14
stay has expired without a decision of a
district court and the FDA approved the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA, the generic
applicant did not enter the market until it
secured a district court decision of patent
invalidity or non-infringement.
How Frequently Have Brand-
Name Companies Sued the
First Generic Applicant?
The study sought to determine the
frequency with which brand-name
companies have initiated patent
infringement lawsuits against generic
applicants within the required 45-day period,
thus triggering the 30-month stay provision. 
The data revealed 75 drug products, out of a
total of 104 NDAs (72 percent), in which the
brand-name company sued the first generic
applicant.  For all but 5 of the 104, the first
generic applicant for one dosage strength of
the drug product (e.g., 10, 20, and 40 mg
tablets) was the first applicant for all
strengths of the drug product.  In light of this
fact, unless otherwise noted, all of the drug
products with multiple strengths (with the
same 5 exceptions) involved one NDA, and
therefore were counted as one brand-name
drug product with one first generic
applicant.  The 5 exceptions are presented in
footnotes 4, 7, and 8 to ensure completeness. 
Table 2-1 summarizes this result.

For the 75 drug products where
patent litigation was brought, the median net
sales in the year the first generic applicant
filed its ANDA were $190 million per year. 
By contrast, the majority of the 29 NDAs for
which no suit was filed had net sales of less
than $100 million in the year the generic
applicant filed its application.3
For 15 of the 29 drug products where
the brand-name company did not sue the
first generic applicant, the generic applicant
began commercial marketing soon after
FDA approval and prior to patent expiration. 
In 6 cases, the FDA has not approved the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA as of June 1,
2002, and the patents have not yet expired. 
In 6 cases the FDA has approved the
ANDA, but commercial marketing has not
yet begun.  And in the remaining 2 cases, the
2 For 1 of the 29 drug products, 2 different
generic applicants were the first to file for each of the 3
different strengths of this drug product.  In each strength,
the brand-name company did not sue the generic applicant. 
As noted above, this brand-name drug product is only
counted once in the total of 29.
3 For 2 of the 29 drug products in which no suit
was filed, the brand-name company‚Äôs patents would have
expired during the first several months of the 30-month
stay.  Because patent expiration terminates the 30-month
stay, it may not have made sense in those cases to initiate
patent infringement litigation, which takes, on average, 25
months to resolve. 
15
patents expired before FDA approved the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA.
What Were the Results of
Patent Infringement Litigation
with the First Generic
Applicant?
The brand-name company sued the
first generic applicant for patent
infringement involving 75 NDAs.  Figure 2-
1 shows a graphical depiction of the
resolution (i.e., a decision of a court, a final
settlement, or miscellaneous resolutions) of
each case as of June 1, 2002.  For 4 drug
products, different generic applicants were
the first to file on different dosage strengths
of the drug product, thus contributing to
multiple suits on the same drug product (and
the same patent) with different generic
applicants.  For clarity, the results of more
than one suit involving the same drug
product are not included in the totals
reported, but are described in footnotes 4, 7,
and 8.  Only results from the first applicant
for a drug product are included in the totals
discussed below.
 
16
Pending Patent Infringement
Litigation
As of June 1, 2002, for 22 of the 75
drug products,4 the district court hearing the
lawsuit has not yet ruled on the merits of the
patent infringement allegations.5  For 7 of
these 22 drug products, the 30-month stay
has expired.  For 3 of these 7 drug products,
the brand-name company also sued for
infringement of a patent that was listed in
the Orange Book after the first generic
applicant had filed its ANDA.6  In these
cases, it has been possible for a brand-name
company to obtain more than one 30-month
stay.  The first 30-month stay has expired in
these 3 cases, but the second (or even later)
one has not.  In none of these cases has the
generic applicant entered the market.
Resolution of Patent Infringement
Suits
There has been a court decision for
53 drug products (75 in total less 22
pending).  The resolution of each is
classified in Table 2-2 and also is described
in Figure 2-1.  Settlements were used in 38
percent of the instances (20 drug products
out of 53 settled).7  A court decision
resolved the patent infringement claims for
30 drug products.  Generic applicants
prevailed 73 percent of the time (22 out of
30),8 and brand-name companies prevailed
27 percent of the time (8 out of 30).  In 3
miscellaneous instances, either the patents
expired before the 30-month stay expired, or
the brand-name company withdrew the
NDA due to safety reasons.
4 In addition to these 22 cases, there are 2 more
pending cases on a dosage strength of a drug product for
which the patent litigation on another strength has been
resolved.  The resolution of these cases is discussed in the
following section.
5 In one pending case, the FDA determined that
the brand-name company failed to submit the required
information for a particular patent in a timely manner. 
Therefore, the generic applicant was not required to submit
a patent certification to address that patent, the 30-month
stay was dissolved, and the FDA subsequently approved
the ANDA.  Commercial patent litigation was still pending
as of June 1, 2002, however, and the generic applicant has
not yet entered the market.
6 As discussed further in Chapter 4, if a brand-
name company lists in the Orange Book later-issued patents
(i.e., patents obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office after obtaining NDA approval) after receiving
notification from a generic applicant, the generic applicant
must re-certify that its ANDA does not infringe the later-
issued patent.  If the brand-name company initiates a patent
infringement suit within 45 days of notice of the generic
applicant‚Äôs re-certification, then FDA approval of the
ANDA is stayed automatically for an additional 30 months
from the notice date or upon final determination of non-
infringement or patent invalidity by a court in the patent
litigation.
7 For one of these 20 drug products, a different
generic applicant was first for each of the product‚Äôs 3 
strengths; the brand-name company settled with 2 of these
applicants, and the litigation involving the other strength is
pending.  This drug product is counted only once as
‚Äúsettled.‚Äù  See supra n. 4.  For another of these 20 drug
products, a different generic applicant was first for each of
the product‚Äôs 2 strengths; the brand-name company entered
a settlement with one generic applicant, and the first
applicant for the other strength prevailed on non-
infringement at the Federal Circuit.  This drug product is
counted only as ‚Äúsettled.‚Äù
8 For one of these 22 drug products, a different
generic applicant was first for each of the product‚Äôs 2
strengths;  the first generic applicant prevailed on non-
infringement at the Federal Circuit on one strength, while
the other case is pending.  This drug product is counted
only once as ‚Äúgeneric prevails.‚Äù  See supra n. 4.  For
another of these 22 products, a different generic applicant
was first for each of the product‚Äôs 3 strengths; the first
generic applicant for each strength prevailed in each patent
suit, which were on the same patent.  This drug product is
counted only once as ‚Äúgeneric prevails.‚Äù

Patent Settlements with the
First Generic Applicant
As shown in Table 2-2, the brand-
name company and the first generic
applicant settled patent infringement
litigation involving 20 drug products.  Most
of the settlements can be classified into 3
types.  Nine of these settlements contained a
provision by which the brand-name
company, as one part of the settlement, paid
the generic applicant (settlements involving
‚Äúbrand payments‚Äù).  Seven of the 20
settlements involved the brand-name
company licensing the generic applicant to
use the patents for the brand-name drug
product prior to patent expiration.  Two of
the settlements allowed the generic applicant
to market the brand-name drug product as a
generic product, under the brand-name
company‚Äôs NDA, not the generic applicant‚Äôs
own ANDA.  The remaining 2 settlements
do not fit into any of these 3 categories.  The
provisions of each of these settlement
agreements are discussed more fully in
Chapter 3.
Generic Applicant Prevails
Table 2-3 shows that the generic
applicant prevailed in litigation over 22 drug
products.9  In 18 instances, a court held that
the brand-name company‚Äôs patents were
either invalid or not infringed.  Of these 18
court decisions, 13 were appellate and 5
were district court (4 of which the brand-
name companies have appealed as of June 1,
2002, but the decisions are pending).  In 9 of
these instances, the court held that the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA did not infringe
the brand-name company‚Äôs product; in the
remaining 9 instances, a court held that the
underlying patent was invalid for reasons
such as being anticipated by prior art or
double patenting.
For 2 of the 18 drug products, the
parties implemented interim settlements that
included brand payments to the generic
applicant.  For both of these drug products,
the generic applicant began marketing after
the interim settlement was terminated and
the Federal Circuit had affirmed the district
court‚Äôs ruling of patent invalidity.10
For 3 of the 4 remaining drug
9 This total does not include the resolution of
follow-on lawsuits on 2 drug products that are counted as
‚Äúsettled.‚Äù  In the first instance, after the parties settled, the
brand-name company submitted a late-issued patent for
listing in the Orange Book, and a second round of litigation
ensued in which the generic applicant prevailed.  In the
second instance, the parties settled the initial lawsuit, but
the generic applicant later re-filed an ANDA for a
reformulated version of the product.  The brand-name
company dismissed this second case with prejudice after
determining that the reformulated version did not infringe
its patents.
10 One of these drug products (Hytrin tablets)
was discussed in Abbott Laboratories, No. C-3945 (May
22, 2000) (consent order), available at
<http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/03/abbott.do.htm>.
18
products (of the 22), the brand-name
company dismissed the litigation after
receiving samples of the generic applicant‚Äôs
proposed product.  In 2 of these cases, the
FDA approved the generic drug soon
thereafter, and generic entry occurred after
the case was dismissed.11  In the other case,
the FDA had not approved the generic drug
product as of June 1, 2002.  For the last of
the 4 drug products, the brand-name
company dismissed the litigation without
prejudice. Entry was delayed in light of an
interim settlement on a later-listed patent for
which the brand-name company failed to sue
the first generic applicant within the
requisite 45 days.12  
The patents covering the 22 brand-
name drug products in which the generic
applicant prevailed involved formulation or
method of use patents.  In 3 instances (out of
6 where a drug substance patent was at
issue), a drug substance patent was found
invalid or not infringed.
Brand-Name Company
Prevails
For 8 drug products, the brand-name
company prevailed in the patent
infringement litigation.  For 7 drug products,
a court held that the generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA infringed the brand-name company‚Äôs
patents.  Two of these decisions were
appellate decisions; the other 5 were district
court decisions, of which only one has been
appealed by the generic applicant.  As of
June 1, 2002, this appeal is pending.  By
contrast, brand-name companies appealed
nearly 90 percent of the cases in which they
obtained an adverse district court opinion. 
In the last of the 8 cases, the generic
applicant abandoned its ANDA after it was
sued, and the court did not issue a final
judgment.
The patent claims in 3 of these patent
lawsuits involved drug substance claims,
and the other 5 involved method of use
and/or formulation claims. 
How Frequently Have Brand-
Name Companies Sued the
Second Generic Applicant?
If the brand-name company sued the
first generic applicant, it also sued the
second generic applicant, if there was one, in
nearly 85 percent of the cases.  There were
43 such instances.  Of the suits that have
been resolved as of June 1, 2002, in no
instance did different district courts reach
different results in resolving infringement
issues over the same brand-name drug
product.
The brand-name company generally
sued all generic applicants if the drug
product had annual sales larger than $500
million in the year the first generic applicant
filed its ANDA.  Twenty such drug products
are included in the study.

What Are the Results of
Litigation with the Second
Generic Applicant if the
Brand-Name Company Settles
with the First Generic
Applicant?
Table 2-3 shows the results of
litigation with the second generic applicant
in those instances in which the first generic
applicant settled its patent infringement
litigation.  Out of a total of 20 drug products
with first generic settlements (see Figure 2-
1), 9 drug products involved litigation with
the second generic applicant.13  In 1 case,
litigation is still pending.  Table 2-3 shows
the resolution of the 8 decided cases.

In these 8 cases, the parties settled in
4, while in 3 the generic applicant prevailed
(2 non-infringement decisions and 1
invalidity decision).  In 1 case, the brand-
name company won a decision of
infringement.  
For Those Patent Litigations
that Resulted in a Court
Decision, How Often Did
Generic Applicants Prevail for
All of the Drug Products in the
Study? 
For many drug products, the brand-
name company sued several generic
applicants over the same patents.  Thus, in
determining how frequently generic
applicants or brand-name companies
prevailed in patent litigation on a drug
product basis, it would be misleading simply
to count the number of decisions in either
party‚Äôs favor, because several of the
decisions may be related to the same patent. 
Table 2-4 shows the results of the resolution
of the patent suits without counting any
similar outcomes involving the same drug
product.  For example, if both the first and
second generic applicant obtained court
decisions of non-infringement, the drug
product is included only once as a generic
win.  If the case against the first generic
applicant settled or is pending, but the case
against the second applicant was resolved,
the resolution of the second case is included. 
In no instance were the outcomes of the suits
against the first and second generic applicant
different.
There were court decisions on 40
different drug products.  Table 2-4 presents
the resolution of the patent litigation derived
from five sources: (1) litigation with the first
generic applicant (Table 2-2), (2) litigation
with the second generic applicant if the first
13 Eleven drug products either did not have a
second generic applicant, or the brand-name company did
not sue the second applicant.
20
generic applicant settled (Table 2-3), (3)
litigation with the second generic applicant
was resolved, but either the first generic
applicant was not sued or the case is pending
(3 drug products), (4) litigation with a third
generic applicant when the first two generic
applicants had settled, and (5) follow-on
litigation with the first generic applicants on
two drug products described in footnote 9.
Generic applicants prevailed for 29
out of 40 drug products (or 73 percent). 
Decisions involving 14 drug products held
that the generic applicant did not infringe the
patent, decisions involving 11 drug products
held the relevant patent(s) invalid, and in 4
cases, the brand-name company abandoned
the litigation with the first generic applicant
before a decision of a court.  
The brand-name company prevailed
against the generic applicant in litigation
involving 11 drug products.  In one of these
11 cases, the generic applicant abandoned
the litigation and admitted infringement
before the court issued a decision.

Results of Litigation and
Patent Invalidity Rates
Out of 40 drug products in Table 2-4,
11 drug products had at least one patent
listed in the Orange Book that was
determined to be invalid.  Thus, the
minimum invalidity rate of patents that the
parties chose to litigate to conclusion is 28
percent (11 invalid findings / 40 total).  This
rate assumes that the patents underlying the
non-infringement decisions and cases when
the brand-name company abandoned the
litigation are valid, even though the courts in
these cases may not have addressed the
validity question.  Thus, the invalidity rate
may be higher than 28 percent, although we
do not have data to determine it.
The recent empirical literature on the
outcome of patent litigation provides a point
of comparison with these findings, and
suggests that this invalidity rate, although it
may be understated as noted above, is not
out of line with that of patents generally. 
Moore compares the outcomes of patent
cases decided by judges with the outcomes
of patent cases in which the finder-of-fact is
a jury.14  In her data set of 1209 patent trial
decisions from 1983 through 1999, she finds
that patents are invalidated in 36 percent of
cases with a judge as the adjudicator and in
29 percent of cases with a jury.15

Cases: An Empirical Peek Inside the Black Box, 98 Mich.

15 Id. at 391.  See, also, John R. Allison & Mark
A. Lemley, Empirical Evidence on the Validity of Litigated
Patents, 26 AIPLA L.Q. 185 (1998).  Allison and Lemley
study the outcomes of patent validity cases from 1989 to
1996.  They focus on those cases in which there exist final
written decisions at either the district court or the Federal
Circuit levels.  In their study, a district court decision is
‚Äúfinal‚Äù if a later decision by the Federal Circuit does not
supersede it.  In their data set of 299 patents in 239
different cases, they find that 46 percent of the final
decisions hold the relevant patent invalid.  In contrast to
this figure which covers all patent validity decisions, they
find that pharmaceutical patents are found invalid in 27
percent of cases.  Allison and Lemley do not consider
decisions that focus only on infringement.
21
How Frequently Did the
Federal Circuit Reverse a
District Court Decision of Non-
Infringement or Patent
Invalidity? 
Of the 29 NDAs where the generic
applicant prevailed, as noted in Table 2-4, in
14 instances, the brand-name company
appealed a district court decision that the
patent at issue was either invalid or not
infringed in a patent suit against either the
first or second generic applicant.16  In 13 of
these decisions, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit affirmed district court
decisions of patent invalidity or non-
infringement ‚Äì 8 affirmed decisions of non-
infringement,17 and 5 affirmed decisions of
patent invalidity.  In the remaining case, two
patents were at issue.  The district court had
determined both patents to be valid, but the
Federal Circuit reversed as to one of the
patents, and affirmed the validity decision
for the other.  Thus, the rate at which the
Federal Circuit reversed decisions of
invalidity and non-infringement for drug
products included in this study was 8
percent.18
Table 2-4 shows that the brand-name
company prevailed in litigation for 11 drug
products.  Of the 4 cases in which the
generic applicant appealed the district
court‚Äôs decision of infringement, the Federal
Circuit affirmed all 4 of these district court
decisions of infringement.
In Which District Courts Did
Brand-Name Companies
Initiate Patent Infringement
Litigation?
In 62 percent of the cases involving
litigation with the first and second generic
applicants, brand-name companies initiated
patent litigation in just five federal judicial
districts.  These were the District of New
Jersey, the Southern District of New York,
the Southern District of Indiana, the
Northern District of Illinois, and the
Southern District of Florida.  Thus, these
courts have more experience with ANDA
patent infringement litigation than most
other federal district courts.19 
16 To ensure no double counting, if the suits
against the first and second generic applicant were
consolidated into 1 district court opinion, and that decision
was appealed, the appellate decision is counted only once. 
This also does not include one case where the district
court‚Äôs decision on summary judgment was vacated and
remanded.  Moreover, of the 29 drug products in which the
generic applicant prevailed, some of the appeals are
pending, or the district court decision was not appealed.
17 In one of these decisions, the district court
held the patent invalid and not infringed.  The Federal
Circuit upheld the non-infringement holding, but reversed
on the invalidity holding.  This has not been counted in the
rate at which the Federal Circuit reversed decisions of
invalidity and non-infringement for drug products included
in this study because the non-infringement decision was
affirmed and generic entry occurred prior to patent
expiration.
18 This rate does not include Federal Circuit
overrules of summary judgement or collateral estoppel
decisions.
19 For those drug products in which both the first
and second generic applicant were sued, approximately 50
percent of the suits were pursued in different district courts.
22
When Did Generic Applicants
Enter the Market?
If a generic applicant was sued for
patent infringement, it generally did not
enter the market until there was a district
court holding that the brand-name
company‚Äôs patent was invalid or not-
infringed.  In no instance has a generic
applicant (either the first or second) entered
the market and then a court later has found
that the patent was infringed, making the
generic applicant subject to damages.
In 22 cases (out of 75, Table 2-1)
involving litigation between the brand-name
company and the first generic applicant, as
of June 1, 2002, the first 30-month stay had
expired before the district court decision.  In
8 of those cases, the FDA approved the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA prior to a district
court ruling on the merits of the patent
infringement suit.20  In the first 2 cases, the
district court case was ongoing as of June 1,
2002, and the generic applicant had not
entered, although it had FDA approval to do
so.  In the next 2 cases, the generic applicant
entered after obtaining a district court
decision, but prior to the Federal Circuit‚Äôs
decision.21  In the fifth case, the generic
applicant waited until the Federal Circuit
affirmed the district court‚Äôs ruling.  In the
sixth case, the generic applicant
reformulated its product and the brand-name
company dismissed the litigation before a
ruling on the merits.  The generic applicant
entered the market soon thereafter.
In the seventh case in which the FDA
approved the generic applicant after the 30-
month stay had expired but before a district
court decision, there were two generic
applicants for different dosage strengths (30
mg and 60 mg) of the same drug product
(Drug Product A).  The discussion of generic
entry that follows only relates to the 60 mg
product.  The brand-name company sued
each generic applicant over the same patent
in different district courts.  The first generic
applicant on the 30 mg product obtained a
district court decision of non-infringement
and the Federal Circuit affirmed this
decision.  The 60 mg generic applicant
entered once the Federal Circuit affirmed the
district court‚Äôs decision of non-infringement
on the 30 mg product.  This occurred,
however, before the district court reached a
decision on the litigation involving the 60
mg generic applicant‚Äôs litigation.
In the eighth case involving a drug
product that was covered by the same patent
that covered Drug Product A (described
above), the generic applicant also entered
prior to a district court decision.  Like the 60
mg generic applicant, the first applicant for
this drug product also entered after the 30
mg decision of non-infringement of Drug
Product A was affirmed by the Federal
Circuit.
 
In separate instances involving the
drug products Taxol and BuSpar, which are
not included in the 22 described above, the
generic applicants began commercial
marketing without waiting for a district
20 In the other 14 cases (22 less 8), either the
district court had not ruled as of June 1, 2002 and the FDA
has not yet approved the ANDA, or the district court ruled
and the FDA acted accordingly, depending upon the
outcome of the litigation.
21 In addition to these 2 instances, generic
applicants for 3 other drug products entered after a district
court case, but prior to the Federal Circuit‚Äôs ruling.  In
these cases, however, the 30 month stay had not expired
before the district court ruled.
23
court decision in their favor on the patent the
brand-name companies had listed in the
Orange Book after the generic applicants
had filed their ANDAs.22  In both cases the
district court eventually held the patent to be
invalid or not infringed.
22  See Chapter 4 for a full discussion of multiple
30-month stays.  Both suits on the later-issued patents
raised questions whether the patents should be listed in the
Orange Book.

Chapter 3  Settlements Related to Paragraph IV Certifications
 
Introduction
Certain patent settlement agreements
between brand-name companies and
potential generic competitors have received
antitrust scrutiny in recent years.  Parties
have debated whether these settlements
increased or harmed consumer welfare.
Patent settlements can resolve
disputes in whole, or in part, and in a timely
manner.  Public policy favors the use of
settlements to reduce the use of limited
judicial resources.  Moreover, settlements
may provide for generic entry that might
otherwise be delayed by patent disputes, and
can reduce uncertainty by clarifying
intellectual property rights among the
parties.  Thus, patent settlements can be
procompetitive.  This potential is not always
fulfilled, however.  As noted earlier, the
FTC has alleged that certain settlements
between brand-name and generic companies
were anticompetitive.
This chapter describes the contours
of agreements that settled patent litigation
between brand-name companies and generic
applicants concerning patents listed in the
Orange Book for the drug products this
study covers.1  The chapter discusses trends
concerning the settlements produced in the
study, and describes similarities and
differences among such settlements.  It also
describes how these settlements compare to
the ones that the Commission alleged to be
anticompetitive in its enforcement actions. 
This chapter does not reach any conclusions
about the competitive effects of the
settlements produced.
Twenty final2 and 4 interim3
agreements that settled litigation between
the brand-name company and the first
generic applicant were produced in response
to the FTC‚Äôs special orders.  In 9 of the final
settlement agreements, the brand-name
company agreed to pay the generic applicant
(a ‚Äúbrand payment‚Äù).  In 7 of the 20 final
settlements, the brand-name company
granted a license to the generic applicant to
use the patents that cover the brand-name
drug product prior to patent expiration so
that the generic applicant could market
under its ANDA.  Two of the final
settlements allowed the generic applicant to
distribute the brand-name drug product as a
generic product, marketed under the brand-
name company‚Äôs NDA, not the generic
applicant‚Äôs own ANDA.  The remaining 2
final settlements do not fit into any of these
3 categories of settlement types.  
1 Brand-name and generic companies produced a
range of other types of agreements relating to the drug
products included in the study.  These agreements are not
discussed in this report.
2 One of these agreements is subject to litigation
currently pending at the FTC.  See Schering-Plough Corp.,
et al., Docket No. 9297, Initial Decision (Jul. 2, 2002),
available at
<http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/07/scheringinitialdecisionp1.

Fourteen of the final settlements with
the first generic applicants, at the time they
were executed, had the potential to delay the
triggering of the first generic applicant‚Äôs
180-day exclusivity for some period of time,
and thus to delay FDA approval of any
subsequent eligible applicants.4  This
potential to delay the triggering of the 180-
day exclusivity existed because the
settlement contained a waiting period before
which the generic applicant could enter the
market.  All of the waiting periods expired at
some time either before the patent(s) expired
or at patent expiration.  Ten brand-name
companies and 10 generic companies used
agreements with respect to 14 drug products. 
See Chapter 5 for a further discussion of
180-day exclusivity.
Most of the final settlements with
brand payments involved drug products with
higher sales than the drug products that the
brand-name companies chose to license or
supply to generic applicants.  Final
settlements with brand payments have been
used by 7 brand-name companies (of which
two companies had 2 such agreements) and
8 generic companies (one of which was a
party to 2 agreements). 
In addition to the final settlements
with the first generic applicant, in 7
instances, brand-name companies entered
final patent settlements with the second
generic applicant.  In 6 of the 7, the brand-
name company also had settled with the first
generic applicant.
Finally, in 6 instances (out of the 53
resolved cases noted in Chapter 2), the first
and second generic applicants entered into
agreements with each other that related to
generic market entry.  Most involved either
relinquishing the 180-day exclusivity or
determining which generic company had
rights to the 180-day exclusivity in light of
agreements between the first generic
applicant and the brand-name company.
Scope of Information
Requested and Received
The FTC‚Äôs special orders required
each brand-name company to submit all
agreements between itself and any person
relating to an ANDA containing a paragraph
IV certification involving any drug product,
when the brand-name company holds the
rights to the NDA corresponding to the
ANDA that is the subject of the agreement. 
Examples of such agreements include, but
are not limited to:  (a) patent litigation
settlements; (b) agreements related to the
filing (or non-filing) of an ANDA by any
applicant (or potential applicant) involving
any drug product; (c) licensing agreements
between the company and persons that have

and (d) agreements related to any
acquisition, divestiture, joint venture,
alliance, license, or merger by the company
of any business involving the research,
development, manufacture, or sale of any
drug product that is the subject of an ANDA. 
The companies were also requested to

reports prepared by or for any officer(s) or
director(s) of the company (or, in the case of
unincorporated entities, individuals
exercising similar functions) that evaluate or

analyze the reasons for making such
agreements.  Generic companies received
similar requests.
Brand-name and generic companies
produced a variety of other agreements
relating to the drug products subject to the
study.  Examples of these agreements
include brand-name and generic companies
obtaining third-party arrangements for the
supply of raw materials, manufacturing,
repackaging, distribution, marketing,
development, and license of formulation
technologies relating to the drug products. 
These agreements are not analyzed in this
chapter.
Overview of Patent Settlements
As discussed in Chapter 2, litigants
reached agreements that finally settled patent
suits involving 20 out of 53 drug products
for which a brand-name company sued the
first generic applicant who had filed an
ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification (see Figure 2-1).  
For 9 drug products, the brand-name
company and the generic applicant settled
the patent infringement litigation through a
license or supply agreement.5  Six of these
agreements occurred in 2000 and 2001.  For
9 other drug products, one component of the
settlement agreement was a payment from
the brand-name company to the generic
applicant.  The existence of brand payment
provisions distinguished these agreements
from those involving a license or supply
arrangement, which did not contain a brand
payment.6  The remaining 2 of the 20
settlements did not fit into either of these
categories.  Table 3-1 categories these 20
final settlements. 
Settlements Involving Patent
Licenses or Supply
Arrangements
In light of the confidential nature of
many of the provisions of these settlements,
the following discussion has been written to
ensure anonymity.  Each lettered drug
product corresponds to a distinct brand-
name drug product.  
5 Two different generic applicants were the first
to file on different strengths of the same drug product.  The
brand-name company settled the litigation with both
applicants (one settlement was a license agreement and the
other was a supply agreement).  Because the different
strengths are covered by only one NDA, the drug product is
counted only once as a ‚Äúsupply agreement‚Äù to ensure
consistency in counting drug products with agreements.
6 Two district court decisions have examined the
use of brand payment provisions in the settlement
agreements involving Cardizem CD and Hytrin.  Both
courts have found the agreements to be per se restraints of
trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  In re
Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 105 F.Supp.2d 618, 684
(E.D. Mich.  2000) and 105 F.Supp.2d 618, 622 (E.D.
Mich.  2000); In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust
Litigation, 164 F.Supp.2d 1340, 1342 (S.D. Fl. 2000). 
Both of these district court decisions are currently on
appeal.

Settlements Involving Patent
Licenses
As discussed in Table 3-2, for 8 drug
products,7  the generic applicant obtained a
non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license
(except for drug product F, which was an
exclusive license, and drug product H,
which was royalty-free) to use the brand-
name company‚Äôs patents for the particular
brand-name product prior to the patent
expiration.   In 4 instances (B, C, D, and G),
generic entry proceeded immediately after
executing the settlement and obtaining FDA
approval.  In the other 4 instances (A, E, F,
and H), the parties agreed to a waiting
period before the generic applicant could
enter.
7  Although 8 drug products involved licenses
with the first generic applicant, the generic applicant for
drug product G was first for only one strength of the
product.  At the time the brand-name company entered into
this license, it had already entered a supply agreement, see
discussion in the following section, with the first generic
applicant for another strength of the drug product.  See
supra n. 5.  For purposes of Table 3-2, this license
agreement is discussed separately.

In 4 instances (A, E, F, and H), there
was only one generic applicant for the drug
product.  The brand-name company did not
sue the second generic applicant for 3 drug
products (B, C, and D) as of June 1, 2002. 
The brand-name company sued the second
generic applicant for drug product G, and
this litigation settled.
Table 3-2 describes the attributes of
30
these 8 patent license agreements and the
royalty provisions in each.  The licenses
were for formulation or method of use
patents.  In each case, except for drug
product D, the generic applicant affirmed the
validity and enforceability of the patent(s) at
issue.  None of the license agreements
prohibited the generic applicant from
developing non-infringing generic versions
of the brand-name drug product, nor did they
involve licenses for other products other
than the one subject to the ANDA litigation.
Among the license agreements
described in Table 3-2, the four agreements
with waiting periods (A, E, F, and H) related
to brand-name drug products in which there
was not yet a second generic applicant for
the drug product as of January 1, 2001.
Settlements Involving Supply
Agreements
As part of two settlements, the
brand-name company entered into a supply
agreement that allowed the generic applicant
to market the brand-name company‚Äôs
product as a generic product.  These
agreements differ from the licenses
described above because the generic
applicant distributes the brand-name
company‚Äôs drug and does not sell product
pursuant to its ANDA.
‚Ä¢           In one of the supply agreements,
generic marketing did not begin until a
subsequent generic applicant was ready to
ship its product to customers.  Annual net
sales for this drug product in the year prior
to the agreement date were over $500
million.  The district court had not yet ruled
in the brand-name company‚Äôs patent
infringement suit against subsequent generic
applicants when the supply agreement with
the first generic applicant was executed. 
Under the agreement, if the patent litigation
with these subsequent applicants resulted in
the patent being declared invalid or not
infringed, then the brand-name company‚Äôs
obligation to supply the first generic
applicant would be triggered.8  The patents
at issue were formulation patents, and the
time difference between the agreement date
and patent expiration was 14 years and one
month.
‚Ä¢           In the other supply agreement, the
generic applicant agreed to pay a substantial
royalty to distribute exclusively a generic
version of the brand-name product
manufactured by the brand-name company.9 
Alternatively, the generic company could
choose a patent license agreement (similar to
those discussed above) in exchange for a
small royalty on net sales.  The agreement is
dated 10 years, 9 months before the
formulation/method of use patent was due to
expire.
Miscellaneous Agreements with the
First Generic Applicant
Two additional agreements did not
appear to raise issues related specifically to
Hatch-Waxman.  For example, one of the
agreements settled litigation over when the
8 The supply agreement sets forth the transfer
price at which the generic company is obligated to purchase
all of its requirements.  The generic applicant is required to
pay a 50% royalty of the net profits from all sales of the
generic product.
9 The supply agreement was for not only the
strength of the drug product for which the generic company
was the first ANDA IV filer, but also for two additional
strengths of the same drug product for which it had not
filed an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification.
31
brand-name company‚Äôs patent should expire. 
These agreements are not discussed in this
report. 
Final Settlements Involving
Brand Payments
Nine out of 20 final settlements
between brand-name companies and generic
applicants involved brand payments from
the brand-name company to the generic
applicant.  The first such agreement included
in the study was executed in March 1993. 
 
The Basic Model
Eight of the 9 agreements with brand
payments followed the same basic model. 
Each prohibited the generic applicant from
purchasing, manufacturing, using, selling,
distributing, and shipping to third parties any
form of the generic‚Äôs drug product until the
expiration of the patents (or in 2 cases, until
the end of waiting period specified in the
agreement, which occurred prior to patent
expiration).  
Four of these settlements also
prohibited the generic applicant from
marketing any other form of the brand-name
company‚Äôs drug product, which was the
subject of the ANDA, prior to patent
expiration or the waiting period established
in the agreement.  These four settlements
involved formulation or method of use
patents.
Two of the settlements included
licenses for drug products other than one
subject to the ANDA litigation.10  
These 8 settlements each had the
effect of precluding FDA approval of the
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA until patent
expiration or, in 2 cases, until the date
specified in the agreement.  Each also had
the further effect of precluding the FDA, for
the duration of the agreement, from
approving a later-filed ANDA with a
paragraph IV certification for the same
brand-name drug product, unless a second
(or later) generic applicant obtained a court
decision of non-infringement or invalidity. 
None of these 8 agreements contained a
provision that prohibited the generic
applicant from relinquishing the 180-day
exclusivity.
As described in Table 3-3, the range
of brand payments was $1.75 million to
$132.5 million, and the time between the
date of agreement and patent expiration
ranged between 4 months and 10 years.

Additional Conditions:  These 8 final
agreements included additional conditions. 
For example, in most of the agreements, the
generic applicant agreed not to cause, aid,
assist others in the purchase, manufacture,
use, sale of a generic version of the drug
product prior to patent expiration or the date
the patent is held invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction and the decision
becomes final.  Another frequent provision
was that the generic applicant not aid or
assist any third party in the preparation,
filing, or processing of an application for a
generic version of the drug product,
including the sharing of any information
obtained through the litigation.
Timing of Settlements:  The
agreements were entered at various times in
relation to whether a court had ruled on the
underlying patent infringement lawsuit.  A
court had not yet ruled on the merits of the
patent infringement suit for 4 drug products. 
For the other 4 drug products, a district court
had ruled on the merits of the brand-name
company‚Äôs infringement claims as follows:
(1) the district court held the patent invalid
on summary judgment, but the Federal
33
Circuit reversed and remanded for trial on
certain factual issues; (2) the district court
held the patent invalid, but the parties settled
and the lower court‚Äôs decision was then
vacated; (3) the district court denied the
brand-name company‚Äôs summary judgment
motion of infringement, thus indicating
triable issues of fact remained; and (4) the
brand-name company obtained a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the generic
applicant‚Äôs sale of the drug product.
Optional Licenses: The brand-name
company for one drug product had the
option of granting the generic company a
non-exclusive, royalty-free license for the
underlying patent rather than making the
brand payments to the generic applicant.  If
the license had been granted, the generic
applicant would have been able to seek
approval of its ANDA and brand payments
would have stopped.  The brand-name
company did not exercise this option.
Optional Supply Agreements: Three
of the final settlements in Table 3-3
involved optional supply agreements under
which the generic applicant would distribute
the brand-name product as a generic.  For 2
of these drug products, the supply
agreements were implemented.  For the
other product, the supply agreement was not
implemented.  These 3 supply agreements
are described below.
The supply agreement involving one
drug product specified that the brand-name
company would supply brand-name product
to foreign affiliates of the generic applicant
for marketing outside the United States
during the 6-month period prior to patent
expiration.
Under the supply agreement
involving another drug product, the brand-
name company appointed the generic
applicant as the non-exclusive distributor for
the sale of the product under a private label
at a cost to the generic applicant equal to
75% of the brand-name company‚Äôs
wholesale druggist price.  The generic
applicant used this supply agreement to
market the brand-name company‚Äôs product
as a generic product.
The brand-name company of the
third drug product entered into an
agreement, not implemented, to supply the
generic applicant with the drug to sell as the
generic version; the agreement prohibited
the generic applicant from manufacturing
the product drug itself.  This agreement
specified the generic‚Äôs resale price at a
limited discount (15% to 30%, based on
certain contingencies) off the brand-name
drug product‚Äôs price.  The brand-name
company was to receive substantial royalties
from the generic company‚Äôs sales of the
product (40% to 33.3%, based on when the
royalty was paid).  
Alternatively, this brand-name
company could decide to make quarterly
payments to the generic applicant instead of
fulfilling the supply agreement.  The
payment schedule, which continued until
expiration of the patent, provided for total
annual payments of at least $50 million. 
The agreement guaranteed the generic
company the right to enter the market with a
generic version of the product (under the
NDA) either 6 months prior to patent
expiration, or immediately upon the patent
being declared invalid or unenforceable. 
Because the supply agreement was not
implemented, the brand-name company
34
made the brand payments to the generic
applicant.  
Miscellaneous Final
Agreement with Brand
Payments
A ninth final agreement involved
brand payments, but did not fit into the basic
model described above.  In this case, the
parties agreed to terminate the 30-month
stay and allow the generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA to be approved soon thereafter. 
Prior to executing the settlement agreement,
the two companies had been involved in
commercial patent infringement litigation
over the brand-name drug product (and
another related drug product) that the
generic company had initiated.  The parties
settled that litigation, entering into an
agreement with cross-royalty provisions. 
One of the cross-royalty provisions provided
the generic company with a 1 percent royalty
on net sales of the brand-name drug product. 
Thus, the brand payment was in the form of
a royalty on the brand-name drug company‚Äôs
drug product. 
Final Agreements with the
First Generic Applicant that
Could ‚ÄúPark‚Äù the Applicant‚Äôs
180-Day Exclusivity
Fourteen of the 20 settlements
obtained through the study, at the time they
were executed, had the potential to ‚Äúpark‚Äù
the first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day
exclusivity for some period of time, and thus
to prevent FDA approval of any subsequent
eligible applicants.  Whether the FDA
actually was prevented from approving
subsequent eligible generic applicants
depends on specific facts, including whether
there were subsequent generic applicant(s)
and the result(s) of any patent litigation with
those applicants. 
These agreements include the 4
license agreements with waiting periods
(drug products A, E, F, and H in Table 3-2),
the 2 supply agreements, and settlements
with brand payments (drug products I
through P in Table 3-3) that had the effect of
precluding FDA approval of the generic
applicant‚Äôs ANDA.  Ten brand-name
companies and 10 generic companies used
agreements with respect to the 14 drug
products.  Chapter 5 discusses how these
settlements could be used to delay FDA
approval of any subsequent eligible generic
applicants.
Interim Agreements
In addition to the 20 final settlements, 4
interim settlements with the first generic
applicant were produced.  The interim
settlements did not resolve the underlying
patent litigation, but were contingent upon
the outcome of the litigation.  The FTC has
taken law enforcement actions relating to 3
of these drug products.11  The FTC‚Äôs actions
relating to 2 of those agreements, involving
Hytrin tablets and capsules, are described in
Box 3-1.  No settlements similar to the
interim settlements challenged by the
Commission were executed after April, 1999
(shortly after the FTC‚Äôs investigations in this
area became public) and the end of the
period covered by this study.
11 See supra, n. 3.  The FTC‚Äôs action regarding
Hytrin involved two drug products (Hytrin capsules and
Hytrin tablets).
35
Box 3-1  Summary of the Commission‚Äôs Action in the Abbott/Geneva Matter
In May 2000, the Commission issued a complaint and consent order against Abbott Laboratories and Geneva
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  The complaint charged that Abbott paid Geneva approximately $4.5 million per month to keep
Geneva's generic version of Abbott's Hytrin, in both tablets and capsules, off the U.S. market, potentially costing consumers
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  Hytrin is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH or
enlarged prostate) - chronic conditions that affect millions of Americans each year. BPH alone afflicts at least 50% of men
over 60.  In 1998, Abbott's sales of Hytrin amounted to $542 million (over 8 million prescriptions) in the United States. 
Abbott projected that Geneva's entry with a generic version of Hytrin would eliminate over $185 million in Hytrin sales in
just six months.
           According to the complaint, Geneva agreed not to enter the market with any generic version of Hytrin, even if it were
non-infringing, until the earlier of: (1) the final resolution of the patent infringement litigation involving Geneva's generic
version of Hytrin tablets, including review through the U.S. Supreme Court; or (2) entry of another generic Hytrin product. 
Geneva also agreed not to transfer, assign, or relinquish its 180-day exclusivity right.  These provisions ensured that no
other company's generic version of Hytrin could obtain FDA approval and enter the market during the term of the
agreement, because Geneva's agreement not to launch its product meant the 180-day exclusivity period would not begin to
run.
           Under the Commission's consent order, Abbott and Geneva are barred from entering into agreements pursuant to
which a first-filing generic company agrees with a manufacturer of a branded drug that the generic company will not (1)
give up or transfer its exclusivity or (2) bring a non-infringing drug to market. In addition, agreements to which Abbott or
Geneva is a party that involve payments to a generic company to stay off the market must be approved by the court when
undertaken during the pendency of patent litigation (with prior notice to the Commission), and the companies are required
to give the Commission 30 days' notice before entering into such agreements in other settings.  Moreover, Geneva was
required to waive its right to a 180-day exclusivity period for its generic version of Hytrin tablets, so other generic tablets
The fourth interim agreement
involved a brand-name drug that had net
sales of over $1 billion per year in the year
before the settlement was executed.  The
settlement was entered at approximately the
same time the 30-month stay had expired. 
To ensure that the generic drug applicant
did not begin commercial marketing until
the district court ruled on the patent
infringement claims, the brand-name
company agreed that, if the patent was
found invalid, the brand-name company
would pay the generic applicant based on
the generic applicant‚Äôs lost profits from the
date of the expiration of the 30-month
through appeals.  Since the date of this
agreement, generic entry has occurred
because of a court decision. 
Agreements Between Brand-
Name Companies and the
Second Generic Applicant
Brand-name companies settled
patent litigation with the second generic
applicant for 7 drug products, out of a total
of 43 suits against the second generic
applicant (see Chapter 2) ‚Äì or at a rate of 16
percent.  This settlement rate is substantially
lower than the settlement rate between
brand-name companies and the first generic
applicant of 38 percent (20 of 53 total
lawsuits against the first generic applicant
settled).  In 6 of the 7 instances, the brand-
company had also entered into a patent
settlement with the first generic applicant.
36
One of the 7 settlements involved
brand payments.  The agreement specified
that the brand-name company would make
brand payments up to $15 million, and that
entry by the second generic could not occur
until 5 years and 6 months after the date of
the agreement (or 2 years and 9 months
before patent expiration).
 
Four of the 7 agreements involved
patent licenses that allowed the second
generic applicant to enter the market prior to
patent expiration using the generic version
of the brand-name drug product approved
through its ANDA.  In 2 of these instances,
the second generic applicant was allowed to
market its generic product immediately after
executing the agreement, obtaining FDA
approval, and paying the brand-name
company a royalty.
 In 1 of the 4 instances, the license
agreement prohibited the generic applicant
from introducing its product into the market
until the brand-name company or another
licensee marketed a generic version of the
brand-name company‚Äôs generic product. 
The brand-name company also entered a
license agreement with the third generic
applicant for the drug product, specifying
that it could come on the market 4 years and
2 months prior to patent expiration.
In the remaining license agreement,
the parties agreed to cross-license related
products in settlement of not only the patent
infringement litigation in response to the
ANDA that had been filed, but also related
infringement litigation involving another
drug product.12
Agreements Between First and
Second Generic Applicants
For 6 out of 68 drug products in
which there was more than one generic
applicant, the first and second generic
applicants entered into agreements related to
generic market entry.  In 4 of these
agreements, one of the main provisions
specified which generic applicant had or
retained rights to the 180 day exclusivity.13 
The other two agreements did not focus on
the 180-day exclusivity provision.
Agreements Focusing on 180-Day
Exclusivity:  In 1 agreement, the first
generic applicant relinquished its rights to
180-day exclusivity for a $3.5 million
license and royalty payment based on the
second generic applicant‚Äôs sales for a period
of 7 years.  In another agreement, the first
and second generic applicants entered into a
supply arrangement under which the first
generic applicant relinquished its rights to
180-day exclusivity so that the second
generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA could be
approved, and the first applicant could
market the second applicant‚Äôs product.  This
step was necessary because the first generic
applicant‚Äôs ANDA was not ready to be
approved at the time of the agreement.
Two other agreements clarified
12 The other 2 of the 7 settlements with the
second generic applicant did not appear to raise issues
related specifically to Hatch-Waxman.
13 For a fuller discussion of the 180-day
exclusivity, see Chapter 5, n. 18 and accompanying text.
37
which generic applicant had rights to the
180-day exclusivity in light of a settlement
agreement between the first generic
applicant and the brand-name company.  In
one case, the first generic applicant changed
its patent certification from a paragraph IV
to a paragraph III, and the agreement settled
a dispute between the first and second
generic applicant regarding whether the first
generic applicant retained its 180-day
exclusivity in those circumstances.  In the
other case, the agreement related to a drug
product that had been the subject of one of
the court cases that invalidated certain of
the FDA‚Äôs rules governing the 180-day
exclusivity.14
Remaining Agreements:  The other 2
agreements involve more detailed
relationships between the first and second
generic applicants.  In one instance, the
brand-name company had licensed its
patents to an over-the-counter product to the
first generic applicant, with a right to
sublicense the patents.  The first generic
applicant granted the sublicense to the
second generic applicant.  In the second
agreement, the first and second generic
applicants allegedly entered into a supply
and distribution agreement that
unreasonably restrained their incentives to
compete against each other.15

Chapter 4  Orange Book Patent Listing Practices and Use of
 Multiple 30-Month Stays
Introduction
The 30-month stay provision of the
Hatch-Waxman Amendments protects
brand-name companies beyond their existing
intellectual property rights.  A 30-month stay
of FDA approval of a potential generic
competitor is invoked if a brand-name
company receives notice of a generic
applicant‚Äôs paragraph IV certification and
files suit for patent infringement within 45
days of that notice.  Filing of the lawsuit
stays the FDA‚Äôs approval of the ANDA until
the earliest of:  (1) the date the patents
expire; (2) a final determination of
non-infringement or patent invalidity by a
court in the patent litigation; or (3) the
expiration of 30 months from the receipt of
notice of the paragraph IV certification.  The
30-month stay affords both the brand-name
company and the generic applicant the
opportunity to resolve patent disputes prior
to commercial marketing, and in tandem
with FDA review of the ANDA for
approval.
The 30-month stay has received
increased attention, because it can have a
significant impact on market entry by
generic drugs.  One 30-month period to
resolve disputes over patents listed in the
Orange Book prior to the ANDA‚Äôs filing
date appears unlikely to delay generic entry,
however, because it historically has
approximated the time necessary for FDA
review and approval of the ANDA and the
duration of a patent lawsuit.  FDA approval
of generic applicants that filed paragraph IV
certifications and were not sued took, on
average, 25 months and 15 days from the
filing date.  On average, the time between
the complaint and a district court decision in
litigation between a brand-name company
and first or second generic applicants was 25
months and 13 days.  The average time
between the complaint and an appellate
decision was 37 months and 20 days.  
Prior to 1998, litigation between a
brand-name company and a first or second
generic applicant generated, at most, one 30-
month stay per drug product per ANDA,
except for two drug products.  For 8 out of
the 9 ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drug products (i.e., drug
products that are among the top 20 drug
products, ranked publicly by annual gross
sales, during one of the years included in the
study) as to which the brand-name company
filed suit against the first generic applicant
prior to 1998, the brand-name company
alleged infringement of 1 or 2 patents.  In
the remaining case, the brand-name
company alleged infringement of 3 patents. 
Since 1998, however, two new
phenomena appear to be emerging.  First, for
drug products with substantial annual net
sales, brand-name companies are suing
generic applicants over more patents.  Since
1998, for only 3 of the 8 ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù drug
products as to which the brand-name
company filed suit against the first generic
applicant, the brand-name company alleged
infringement of 1 or 2 patents.  In the
remaining 5 instances, the brand-name
company alleged infringement of 3 or more
40
patents.  With additional patents to be
litigated, the average time to obtain a court
decision has increased.  As of June 1, 2002,
for 6 of the 7 cases that have been pending
for more than 30 months without a decision
from a district court, the brand-name
company has alleged infringement of 3 or
more patents.
Second, by the timely listing of
additional patents in the Orange Book after a
generic applicant has filed its ANDA (later-
issued patents), brand-name companies can
obtain additional 30-month stays of FDA
approval of the generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA. 
Although the generic applicant had already
certified to the patents previously listed in
the Orange Book for a particular drug
product, it must re-certify to the newly listed
patent(s) and notify the brand-name
company of its re-certification.  If the brand-
name company sues for patent infringement
on the new certification within 45 days of
notification, a new 30-month stay will begin
to run.  The FDA is prohibited from
approving the ANDA until the new 30-
month stay expires.
In 8 instances, brand-name
companies have listed later-issued patents in
the Orange Book after an ANDA has been
filed for the drug product.  For the 8 drug
products, the additional delay of FDA
approval (beyond the first 30 months)
ranged from 4 to 40 months.  In all of the 4
cases so far with a court decision on the
validity or infringement of a later-issued
patent, the patent has been found either
invalid or not infringed by the ANDA.  
Moreover, most of the later-issued
patents in the Orange Book raise questions
about whether the FDA‚Äôs patent listing
requirements have been met.  For example,
many of the later-issued patents do not
appear to claim the approved drug product
or an approved use of the drug.  Recent court
opinions hold that Hatch-Waxman does not
provide a right of action through which
generic applicants may challenge a patent
listing in the Orange Book.  Thus, to
terminate a second 30-month stay, a generic
applicant‚Äôs only recourse is to obtain a
decision of a court on patent infringement or
invalidity. 
This chapter sets forth the legal and
regulatory background of the 30-month stay
provision, including a discussion of the
patent listing requirements.  It then reviews
the patent-related information requested
from brand-name company and generic
companies.  For each NDA that was within
the scope of the study, brand-name
companies were required to identify all
patents that the company has listed in the
Orange Book and the date of listing
(regardless of whether currently listed in the
Orange Book).1  This information provides
the basis for an examination of the patents
that led to the granting of multiple 30-month
stays.  Generic companies were required to
provide information on instances in which
they alleged that a patent had been
improperly or untimely listed in the Orange
Book.  This information was used to identify
any trends in the patent listings.
1 Many brand-name companies noted that they
could only provide information about when they had
submitted the patent to the FDA for Orange Book listing
rather than the date on which the patent was actually listed.
41
Box 4-1  Patents and Patentability
A patent is the grant of a right to exclude others from ‚Äúmaking, using, offering for sale, or selling‚Äù an invention.  U.S. patent laws
are enacted pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which states that Congress shall have the power "[t]o promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings
and Discoveries."
There are three basic types of patents: utility, plant, and design patents.  Utility patents generally have a term of 20 years from the
date on which the application for the patent was filed.  Utility patents are divided into three basic categories:  chemical, electrical and
mechanical.  Pharmaceutical patents are a subset of chemical patents and are issued over four different categories:  drug substance, method
of use, formulation, and process.  Drug substance patents cover the compound or active ingredient in the drug product, such as fluoxetine
hydrochloride, which is the active ingredient in Prozac.  Method of use patents cover the use of the product to treat certain health problems,
such as depression or asthma.  Formulation patents cover the physical composition or delivery mechanism of the drug product, such as an
extended release tablet or capsule.  Process patents generally cover the procedure used to make the active ingredient.
To be patentable, an invention must be new and useful, as well as non-obvious.  The Patent Office determines novelty by
searching prior patents and publications.  The patent must also contain a written description to ‚Äúenable any person skilled in the art to which
it pertains . . . to make and use‚Äù the invention.  Non-obviousness is determined in light of the prior art and involves asking whether a person
skilled in the art would consider the invention to be ‚Äúobvious.‚Äù 
Legal and Regulatory
Background of the 30-Month
Stay Provision
As part of the FDA process to obtain
approval of a new drug product under
Hatch-Waxman, brand-name companies
must submit information on any patent
claiming the approved drug and for which a
claim of patent infringement could
reasonably be asserted.  The FDA then lists
the approved drug and its related patents in
the Orange Book.  Box 4-1 describes how
patents are obtained and how the
pharmaceutical industry uses them.
A
generic applicant, as part of the ANDA
process, must provide a certification to the
FDA regarding its generic product and any
patents listed in the Orange Book that claim
the brand-name drug.  When a generic
applicant makes a paragraph IV certification,
it claims that the patents listed in the Orange
Book either are invalid or will not be
infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of
the generic drug product for which the
ANDA is submitted.  Frequently, a generic
applicant will make multiple certifications in
its ANDA, depending upon the number of
patents listed in the Orange Book.  For
example, a generic applicant may make a
paragraph III certification (indicating that it
will not begin commercial marketing until
that patent expires) for a brand-name drug
product‚Äôs drug substance patent, but also
make paragraph IV certification(s) with
respect to listed method of use and/or
formulation patents.
            The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
further provide that each generic applicant
making a paragraph IV certification must
notify each patent owner and the brand-
name company for the listed drug.  If the
patent owner and/or brand-name company
do not initiate a patent infringement suit
within 45 days after receiving notice of a
paragraph IV certification, then the FDA's
review and generic approval process may
proceed according to the FDA's schedule.  If,
however, a patent infringement suit is filed
within the 45-day window, the FDA's
approval of the ANDA is automatically
stayed until the earliest of:  (1) the date the
patents expire; (2) a final determination of
non-infringement or patent invalidity by a
42
court in the patent litigation; or (3) the
expiration of thirty months from the receipt
of notice of the Paragraph IV certification.  
The initial 30-month stay is not
dependent upon the number of patents for
which a paragraph IV certification is made. 
Whether a generic applicant makes an initial
paragraph IV certification with respect to
one patent, or to multiple patents, only one
30-month stay will be invoked.
The 30-month stay provision
provides the brand-name company an
additional exclusionary right beyond those
granted by the patent system.  Even absent
the 30-month stay, a brand-name company
may file suit against an accused infringer,
such as an ANDA applicant, and prevent the
accused infringer from marketing its product
by obtaining a preliminary injunction.2  To
obtain a preliminary injunction, a patentee
must establish four factors:  (1) a reasonable
likelihood of success on the merits;  (2)
irreparable harm if the injunction were not
granted;  (3) the balance of the hardships,
and (4) the impact of the injunction on the
public interest.3
Patent Listing Statute and
Regulations
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
describe the patent information that brand-
name companies must file with any new
drug application (NDA).  Once the FDA
approves the drug, it then lists the patents in
the Orange Book.  Specifically, the listing
statute requires that an NDA filer ‚Äúshall file
with the application the patent number and
the expiration date of any patent which
claims the drug for which the applicant
submitted the [new drug] application or
which claims a method of using such drug
and with respect to which a claim of patent
infringement could reasonably be asserted if
a person not licensed by the owner engaged
in the manufacture, use, or sale of the
drug.‚Äù4    
The FDA has adopted regulations
governing the types of patents that can be
listed in the Orange Book.5   The listing
regulation is separated into 6 subsections
below for ease of reading. Specifically, the
brand-name company must list in the Orange
Book each patent which:
[1]  claims the drug or a method of
using the drug that is the subject of the new
drug application or amendment or
2 See, e.g., Purdue Pharma L.P., v. Boehringer
Ingelheim GMBH, 237 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
(affirming district court‚Äôs grant of a preliminary injunction
blocking marketing of a generic drug product).
3 Relatively little case law exists to indicate the
ease or difficulty for the brand-name company to obtain a
preliminary injunction against an ANDA applicant.  A few
cases do suggest circumstances in which a preliminary
injunction may be granted.  When a patentee establishes a
likelihood of success on the merits, it is entitled to a
rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm.  For example,
when the brand-name company is able to show evidence of
price erosion and its expected loss of market share caused
by introduction of a competing drug product, or of a
generic applicant‚Äôs likely inability to pay the brand-name
company‚Äôs lost profit damages, a preliminary injunction
may be granted.  See, e.g., Purdue Pharma L.P., v.
Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
6563 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff‚Äôd 237 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed.
Cir. 2001); Glaxo Group, Ltd v. Ranbaxy Pharms., Inc.,
262 F.3d 1333, 1338  (Fed. Cir. 2001) (discussing district
court‚Äôs decision to grant preliminary injunction because
generic manufacturer could not pay NDA holder‚Äôs potential
damages); see Chisum on Patents, ¬ß 20.04(e)(iv) (Matthew
Bender).

supplement to it and
[2] with respect to which a claim of
patent infringement could reasonably be
asserted if a person not licensed by the owner
of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use
or sale of the drug product. 
This portion of the listing regulation,
requiring that a listed patent satisfy two
independent prongs, is nearly identical to the
governing statute, 21 U.S.C. ¬ß  355(b)(1),
except that the regulation substitutes the term
‚Äúdrug product‚Äù for the term ‚Äúdrug‚Äù in the
second prong.  The FDA interprets the term
‚Äúdrug‚Äù in the statute‚Äôs first prong to mean
‚Äúdrug product.‚Äù  A district court has
affirmed this interpretation.6  Thus, it is the
drug product,7 approved through the NDA,
that controls the listing analysis of the two
prongs ("claims the drug" and "a claim of
patent infringement‚Äù).
The remainder of the listing
regulation elaborates on the meaning of the
two independent prongs:
[3] For purposes of this part, such
patents consist of drug substance (ingredient)
patents, drug product (formulation and
composition) patents, and method of use
patents.  
[4] Process patents are not covered by
this section and information on process
patents may not be submitted to FDA.  
[5] For patents that claim a drug
substance or drug product, the applicant shall
submit information only on those patents that
claim a drug product that is the subject of a
pending or approved application, or that
claim a drug substance that is a component of
such a product.
[6] For patents that claim a method of
use, the applicant shall submit information
only on those patents that claim indications or
other conditions of use of a pending or
approved application.8
Timing of Listing Later-Issued
Patents
Brand-name companies may list
later-issued patents (i.e., patents obtained
from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
after obtaining NDA approval) so long as
they do so within 30 days of being granted
the patent.9  Two scenarios are possible,
depending on whether a later-issued patent
is listed prior to or after the generic
applicant files its ANDA.  If the later-issued
patent is listed prior to a generic applicant‚Äôs
filing of an ANDA, then the generic
applicant will certify regarding that patent
along with all the other listed patents.  A
brand-name company‚Äôs suit on those patents
within 45 days will generate only one 30-
month stay, despite the fact that multiple
patents are at issue in the litigation. 
If, however, the later-issued patent is
listed after a generic applicant has filed its
6 Pfizer, Inc. v. FDA, 753 F. Supp. 171 (D.  Md.
1990).
7 The FDA‚Äôs regulations define ‚Äúdrug product‚Äù as
‚Äúa finished dosage form, for example, a tablet, capsule,
solution, etc., that contains an active drug ingredient
generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive
ingredients.‚Äù 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 210.3(4).
8 Id.
9 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(c)(2).  Of course, a brand-
name company can list a patent more than 30-days after
issuance; however, pending generic applicants do not have
to re-certify to that patent.
44
ANDA with a paragraph IV certification,
then the generic applicant must re-certify
that its ANDA does not infringe the later-
issued patent.  If the brand-name company
sues within 45 days of the generic
applicant‚Äôs re-certification, then a second
30-month stay will issue.  Thus, a brand-
name company can obtain an additional 30-
month stay of FDA approval if it lists
patents in the Orange Book after notice of
an ANDA containing a paragraph IV
certification, and then sues for patent
infringement upon notice of the generic
applicant‚Äôs re-certification.  It is not
necessary for the multiple 30-month stays to
run consecutively; it is possible for gaps to
exist between the multiple 30-month stays. 
For example, the first stay may have expired
without a decision of a court or FDA
approval of the ANDA, but a later-issued
patent triggers an additional 30-month stay.
Lack of Review of Patents in
the Orange Book
The FDA has stated that it lacks the
resources and the expertise to review patents
submitted with NDAs.  The agency does not
ensure that a submitted patent claims the
approved drug before listing it in the Orange
Book.10  Moreover, the FDA has declined to
enact any administrative procedures for
resolving listing disputes.  If a party disputes
the accuracy of a listed patent, it may notify
the FDA.  The FDA then will request the
brand-name company to confirm the
correctness of the listed patent information. 
Unless the brand-name company voluntarily
withdraws or amends its listed information,
the FDA will not change the patent
information in the Orange Book.  If the
information remains unchanged, generic
applicants must certify to the disputed
patent.11  Two courts have upheld this
policy.12
Several generic applicants have
attempted to obtain court orders requiring
the FDA or brand-name companies to delist
certain patents from the Orange Book. 
When a patent is delisted, the 30-month stay
will not run and, hence, the FDA is free to
approve the ANDA, if other regulatory
requirements are met.  However, two recent
court decisions have held that there is no
private right of action under Hatch-
Waxman.13
10 59 Fed. Reg. 50338, 50343 (Oct. 3, 1994)
(‚ÄúFDA does not have the expertise to review patent
information.  The agency believes that its resources would
be better utilized in reviewing applications rather than
reviewing patent claims.‚Äù); Abbreviated New Drug
Application Regulations, 54 Fed. Reg. 28872, 28910
(1989) (‚ÄúIn deciding whether a claim of patent
infringement could reasonably be asserted  . . . the agency
will defer to the information submitted by the NDA
applicant.‚Äù). 
11 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(f). 
12 See aaiPharma v. Thompson, 2002 WL
1473429 (4th Cir. Jul. 10, 2002); Watson Pharmaceuticals
v. Henney, Civil Action No. 00-3516 (D. Md. Jan. 17,
2001).
13 Andrx Pharm, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 276 F.3d
1368 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Mylan Pharm, Inc. v. Thompson,
268 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Nor do the patent laws
permit an assertion of improper listing as a defense to
patent infringement.  Mylan, 268 F.3d at 1330-32.  The
Federal Circuit, however, has suggested that a generic
applicant might sue the FDA under the Administrative
Procedures Act to compel it to delist a patent and to
approve an ANDA subject to a 30-month stay that flows
from an improperly listed patent.  Andrx, 276 F.3d at 1378-
79.  This suggestion contradicts the FDA‚Äôs court-approved
policy of not reviewing patents submitted with NDAs.
47
District Court for the District of Columbia
found the FDA‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúcourt‚Äù to
be inconsistent with the statute‚Äôs plain
meaning; the FDA was directed to approve
an ANDA upon a decision of a district court
finding a patent invalid, unenforceable, or
not infringed.
To comply with this decision, the
FDA has provided a ‚ÄúGuidance for Industry‚Äù
that redefines ‚Äúcourt‚Äù to be a district court. 
This definition applies, however, only to
ANDAs containing paragraph IV
certifications that were filed with the FDA
after March 2000.  If a generic applicant
filed its ANDA with the paragraph IV
certification prior to March 2000, the
definition of a court will remain ‚Äúthe court
that enters final judgment from which no
appeal can be or has been taken.‚Äù18
Duration of Patent
Infringement Litigation
Table 4-1 shows the average time it
took to obtain a decision of a district court
and, then, an appellate court in ANDA
patent infringement cases involving the drug
products included within the scope of the
study.  On average, the time between
complaint and district court decisions in
litigation with the first generic applicant was
25 months and 21 days.  The time between
complaint and an appellate decision was 38
months and 27 days.  For ANDA
infringement litigation with the second
generic applicant, the time frames were
slightly shorter as shown in Table 4-1. 
Table 4-119 also shows the average for
litigation involving both first and second
generic applicants.

Several observations can be made
from the data.  First, patent infringement
litigation over blockbuster drugs
increasingly has involved more patents. 
Prior to 1998, for 8 out of the 9 blockbuster
drug products as to which the brand-name
company filed suit against the first generic
applicant, the brand-name company alleged
infringement of 1 or 2 patents.  In the
remaining case, the brand-name company
alleged infringement of 3 patents.  Since
1998, for only 3 out of the 8 blockbuster
drug products as to which the brand-name
company filed suit against the first generic
applicant, the brand-name company alleged

day exclusivity, see Chapter 5.
19 Table 4-1 contains cases that resulted in a
court opinion, including cases involving the same drug
product, but a different dosage strength or generic applicant
(if different generic applicants were first for different
dosage strengths).  It does not include stipulated dismissals
or consent entered by the court pursuant to a patent
settlement agreement.

infringement of 1 or 2 patents.  In the
remaining 5 instances, the brand-name
company alleged infringement of 3 or more
patents.  For example, the brand-name
company for blockbuster drug products such
as Prilosec, Claritin, and Paxil sued the first
generic applicant for patent infringement on
six, three, and six patents, respectively.  One
drug product, Lupron, has 12 listed patents
for which the brand-name company has
alleged infringement.
Second, cases involving multiple
patents appear to extend beyond the average
time it took to resolve the patent
infringement cases identified in Table 4-1. 
The data suggest that cases involving
multiple patents take longer to resolve than
those involving fewer patents.  As of June 1,
2002, for 6 out of the 7 cases that have been
pending for more than 30 months without a
decision from a district court (see Figure 2-
1), the brand-name company has alleged
infringement of 3 or more patents.
Third, district courts have issued
decisions about non-infringement in a
shorter period of time than decisions of
patent invalidity.  The average time between
the filing of the complaint against either the
first or second generic applicant and a
decision of non-infringement was 19
months, 23 days.  By contrast, the average
time to obtain a district court decision of
patent invalidity was 33 months, 5 days.
Multiple 30-Month Stays on
Later-Issued Patents For Drug
Products in the Study
The data revealed 8 drug products
(out of 104 in the study) for which the
brand-name company listed a patent in the
Orange Book after the first generic applicant
had filed its ANDA.20  In these cases, the
brand-name company obtained one or more
additional 30-month stays for the drug
product.  Table 4-2 shows that the majority
of the second 30-month stays have issued
since 1999.21  In contrast to the discussion in
Chapter 3 concerning settlement agreements,
the discussion here is not anonymous
because the Orange Book listings and patent
information is readily available in the public
domain.

The patent listings involving
GlaxoSmithKline‚Äôs (GSK)22 drug product
Paxil illustrate the impact that multiple 30-
month stays can have on the timing of FDA
approval, and thus the beginning of generic
competition.  Four additional 30-month
stays have prevented FDA approval of
generic competition against Paxil for
approximately 65 months.23  GSK
manufactures and distributes Paxil, which
the FDA has approved for the treatment of
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.24
The FDA approved Paxil in
December 1992.  Patent No. 4,007,196 (the
‚Äò196 patent) covering the active ingredient
paroxetine hydrochloride had expired prior
to this date and, therefore, was not listed in
the Orange Book.  However, GSK listed
Patent No. 4,721,723 (the ‚Äò723 patent)
which claims paroxetine hydrochloride
hemihydrate.  (A hemihydrate is a form of
the active ingredient that has one water
molecule for every two paroxetine
molecules incorporated into its crystalline
structure.)
Apotex Corporation filed an ANDA
for generic Paxil on March 31, 1998.  With
the ANDA, Apotex submitted a paragraph
IV certification for the ‚Äò723 patent, the only
patent listed in the Orange Book at that time. 
GSK‚Äôs infringement suit generated the first
30-month stay, which expired in
approximately November 2000.  Since
March 1998, however, GSK has listed nine
additional patents in the Orange Book and
brought infringement suits against Apotex
on four of them.  The four infringement suits
generated four additional 30-month stays
that created an automatic stay on FDA
approval of generic Paxil totaling over 5
years.  Figure 4-1 depicts graphically the
stay on FDA approval of Apotex‚Äôs ANDA.
22 Before the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham, Paxil was manufactured and
distributed by SmithKline Beecham, which was also the
original NDA holder.  For simplicity, however, we will
refer throughout to GSK.
23 Apotex Corporation, Novartis (Geneva),
Mylan, Alphapharm, IVAX, and Pentech have all filed
ANDAs for generic Paxil.  GSK sued each of them for
infringing at least some of the patents discussed.  For
simplicity in demonstrating the effect of the more recently
listed patents and the 30-month stays they generated, we
will focus on the suits GSK brought against Apotex.

to be infringed by a bioequivalent generic
product.  Conversely, it is possible for a
bioequivalent generic product to infringe a
patent that does not claim the brand-name
drug (and hence should not be listed in the
Orange Book).26
Second, the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments and listing regulations grant
brand-name companies the 30-month stay
only for those patents that claim its approved
drug product or an approved use of that
product.  The Amendments do not grant the
protection of the 30-month stay to every
patent that a bioequivalent generic product
may infringe.  This does not mean, however,
that a brand-name product is left vulnerable
to infringing generic products.  A brand-
name company may obtain and enforce
patents covering bioequivalent ‚Äúdesign-
around‚Äù formulations of its product.  In fact,
the brand-name company may bring its
infringement suit at the time the generic files
its ANDA, even when the patent is not listed
in the Orange Book.27  Moreover, just like
any patent holder, brand-name company
companies may prevent initial marketing of
a generic product by demonstrating
entitlement to a preliminary injunction in
patent infringement litigation.  Thus, Orange
Book listings control only whether a brand-
name company may obtain an automatic 30-
month stay, not whether and when it may
obtain and assert patent protection.
Third, even after a patent satisfies the
first prong of the statute (‚Äúclaims the drug‚Äù),
to be properly listed it must still satisfy the
independent second prong, requiring that a
‚Äúclaim of patent infringement could
reasonably be asserted‚Äù against the NDA
holder‚Äôs approved drug product.28  The
analysis depends on whether the branded
and approved drug product, rather than the
generic product, infringes the patent, absent
a license.  Whether a patentee can
‚Äúreasonably‚Äù assert a claim of patent
infringement is not limited to infringement
but also includes the validity and
enforceability of the patent.
Fourth, the listing regulation requires
26 This is especially true for formulation patents,
which cover composition of a drug product, rather than its
active ingredient.  A generic drug company may formulate
its drug product differently than the brand-name product,
but still produce a bioequivalent product.  The generic‚Äôs
different formulation may not infringe the brand‚Äôs patent
covering its own formulation.  See, e.g., Biovail Corp. v.
Andrx Pharma., Inc., 239 F.3d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
(Andrx‚Äôs formulation did not infringe listed patent).  On
the other hand, a generic company‚Äôs own formulation may
be sufficiently different to merit its own patent protection. 
See U.S. Patent No. 5,567,441 (patent on diltizem
formulation assigned to Andrx).
27 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(e)(2) makes it an act of 
infringement to submit an ANDA for a drug ‚Äúclaimed in a
patent.‚Äù  This statute allows infringement litigation based
on the filing of an ANDA in spite of ¬ß 271(e)(1)‚Äôs safe
harbor provision protecting activities related to obtaining
FDA approval from infringement allegations.  As one
district court has recognized, nothing in the statute limits
suits under ¬ß 271(e)(2) to those based on patents listed in
the Orange Book.  In re Buspirone Antitrust Litigation, 185
F. Supp. 2d 363, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (patentee could have
brought its infringement suit without relying on its Orange
Book listing); see also Mylan Pharma., Inc. v. Thompson,
268 F.3d 1323, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (rejecting
argument that Mylan‚Äôs challenge to Orange Book listing
could be viewed as a defense to Bristol‚Äôs assertion of patent
infringement under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(e)(2) suggesting that
an infringement suit under ¬ß 271(e)(2) does not require that
the asserted patent be listed in the Orange Book).  In spite
of this fact, one recent district court decision suggested that
an Orange Book listing and a paragraph IV certification is a
necessary predicate to a patent suit under ¬ß 271(e)(2). 
Allergan Inc. v. Alcon Labs, Inc., 200 F.Supp.2d 1219
(C.D. Cal. 2002).  To ensure that litigation can proceed
upon the filing of an ANDA, without such an Orange Book
listing and a paragraph IV certification, this decision
should be overruled.

that the patent ‚Äúclaim‚Äù the approved drug
product.29  The Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit has explained that the term
‚Äúclaim‚Äù under the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments has the standard meaning as
understood in patent law.30   A patent
‚Äúclaims‚Äù a product only when the written
section of the issued patent labeled the
‚Äúclaims‚Äù define it.  As the Federal Circuit
stated, ‚Äúthe plain meaning of ‚Äòclaims‚Äô is not
the same as the plain meaning of
infringement.‚Äù31  Even though a drug
product or its use may infringe a patent
under the doctrine of equivalents,32 or
indirectly through theories of contributory
infringement or inducement to infringe, that
patent does not ‚Äúclaim‚Äù the product.33 
Consequently, a brand-name company may
not list a patent in the Orange Book when its
approved drug product infringes the patent
only indirectly or under the doctrine of
equivalents, and not directly and literally.
One general concern overlays all four
points.  One function of the Orange Book is
to provide notice to ANDA applicants of
relevant patents.  There is, however, a trade-
off between using the Orange Book to
provide notice of all relevant patents and
implementing a methodology that grants the
protection of the 30-month stay to a defined
class of patents, as does the current statutory
methodology.  One consequence of
restricting the patents listed in the Orange
Book is that the Orange Book would then
not provide notice of every patent that an
ANDA filer might infringe.  For example,
beyond those patents that do not claim the
brand-name company‚Äôs drug product, the
Orange Book also provides no notice of
process patents.  The importance of the
notice function of the Orange Book is
unclear, however.  Many companies may not
need an Orange Book listing to provide
notice, given the sophistication of their
patent searching techniques and the common
practice of monitoring newly listed patents
on a regular basis.34
The analysis identified three broad
categories of patents that raise questions
about whether they fall within the class the
Hatch-Waxman Amendments defines as
listable in the Orange Book.  These
categories, which are more fully explained
in Appendix H, are:

the Patent Term Restoration portion of the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments at 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 156(a)).   A district court has
held that this interpretation of  ‚Äúclaims‚Äù applies to the
listing statute.  Mylan Pharma., Inc. v. Thompson, 139 F.

759.
32 If an accused device does not literally infringe
a patent claim because it lacks some element of that claim,
it may infringe under the doctrine of equivalents if it
contains some element that is insubstantially different from
the claim element which it lacks.  Warner-Jenkinson Co.,
Inc. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17, 35-36
(1997).

claims becomes even more tenuous under the doctrine of

considered to claim the drug formulation or
method of use approved through the NDA. 
For example:
a.
Metabolite patents that claim
the chemical compound into
which a patient‚Äôs body
converts the approved drug
product;
b.  
Drug intermediate patents
that claim a chemical
compound used during
production of the active
ingredient, but not appearing
in the final drug product; and
c.         Polymorph patents that claim
a crystalline form of the
active ingredient that differs
from the approved crystalline
form;
2.
Product-by-process patents
that claim a drug product produced by a
specified process; and
3.
Patents that constitute
double-patenting because they claim subject
matter that is obvious in view of the claims
of another patent invented by the same
person.
Several points emerge from the
analysis in Appendices G and H comparing
these patents to the class of patents defined
as listable by the statute.  The large majority
of patents creating an additional 30-month
stay raise some kind of listing issue.  It is
important to note that this patent analysis
applies not only to late-issued patents, but
also potentially to patents listed prior to the
filing of ANDA.  The patents generating the
first or sole 30-month stay have, on
occasion, raised similar listability issues. 
Determining whether these patents
are appropriately listed sometimes involves
an analysis of chemistry, patent law, and
FDA law.  Many of the listing issues
concern the FDA‚Äôs listing regulations,
however, rather than interpretations of
patent scope.  For instance, the question of
whether metabolite, drug intermediate,
polymorph, and product-by-process patents
may be listed appears to depend on
interpretations of the listing regulations.  As
Appendix H details, the identification of
individual patents as falling into one of
those categories is usually relatively straight-
forward.  
To the degree there is uncertainty
about the scope of the listing regulations,
they could be clarified by regulation or
guidance.  The FDA's clarification of these
issues is important to antitrust challenges to
improper Orange Book listings.  The
question of whether a patent claims some
unapproved aspect (and hence should not be
listed) may depend more on an interpretation
of the NDA‚Äôs scope of approval than an
interpretation of the patent.  A mechanism
by which the FDA could comment on the
scope of an NDA would be helpful in
resolving some listing disputes, as occurred
in the Tiazac situation described in Box 4-4. 
An antitrust suit involving complex
elements beyond the propriety of the listing
is the only current mechanism to challenge
an Orange Book listing.
To clarify some of these issues (but
not all), the FTC staff has submitted a
Citizen Petition to the FDA that seeks
guidance concerning the criteria that a patent
56
must meet before it can be listed in the
Orange Book.35  The requested guidance
could eliminate uncertainty surrounding the
appropriateness of listing some types of
patents, in particular polymorph patents, in
the Orange Book, but it will leave other
issues unaddressed.  The FTC staff Citizen
Petition is pending.

Citizen Petition, available at

Chapter 5  180-Day Marketing Exclusivity Under the Hatch-
 Waxman Amendments
Introduction
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
provide 180 days of marketing exclusivity to
the first generic application that seeks entry
prior to expiration of the patents listed for
the relevant brand-name drug product.  The
exclusivity allows this first generic applicant
to sell the only generic substitute for a
brand-name drug product for 180 days after
either i) first commercial marketing by the
first generic applicant, or ii) a decision of a
court holding the relevant patents to be
invalid or not infringed.1  The grant of 180-
day exclusivity to the first generic applicant
creates an incentive for a generic company
to challenge a brand-name company‚Äôs drug
product patents.  One court has explained
that 180-day exclusivity rewards the first
generic applicant for the expense and effort
involved with challenging a listed patent.2  
If the 180-day exclusivity for the first
generic applicant does not run, then the FDA
may not approve any subsequent eligible
generic applicants.  Thus, if the first generic
applicant agrees not to trigger the 180-day
exclusivity, the possibility exists that no
generic applicant may enter the market.  The
Commission‚Äôs interest in 180-day
exclusivity has focused on the agreements
between brand-name and generic companies
that have affected whether and when first
generic applicants have triggered the running
of 180-day exclusivity.  The Commission‚Äôs
antitrust law enforcement actions have
alleged that certain brand-name and generic
companies have entered into agreements
that, among other things, have had the effect
of delaying entry by the first generic that
otherwise would trigger the running of the
180-day exclusivity, thereby creating a
bottleneck for any subsequent eligible
generic entry.3  
The regulatory landscape
implementing the 180-day exclusivity
provision has shifted over the last several
years, and this may have affected the
frequency with which generic applicants
obtain 180-day exclusivity.  Before 1992 (a
time period not included in the FTC‚Äôs
study), the FDA granted 180-day exclusivity
to 3 generic applicants.  From 1992 until
1998, the FDA granted 180-day exclusivity
to no generic applicants.  Since 1998, when
the FDA changed its regulations in response
to a court ruling,4 and more ANDAs
containing paragraph IV certifications have
been filed, the FDA has granted 180-day
exclusivity to the first generic applicant for
31 drug products.

scope of this study, the generic applicant‚Äôs
commercial marketing has triggered the 180-
day exclusivity in 19 of 31 instances.  The
data show that when the brand-name
company did not sue the first generic
applicant for patent infringement (29 drug
products, see Table 2-1), the first generic
applicant began commercial marketing soon
after receiving FDA approval.
The data show that 14 of the 20 final
settlements obtained through the study
(discussed in Chapter 3) had the potential, at
the time they were executed, to ‚Äúpark‚Äù the
first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity
for some period of time, thus preventing
FDA approval of any eligible subsequent
applicants.  In addition to the 20 final
settlement agreements, there were 4 interim
settlement agreements pursuant to which the
patent litigation continued, but the parties
agreed upon certain conditions in the
meantime.  The Commission, as noted
above, has challenged interim settlements
for 3 drug products. 
This chapter describes the 180-day
provision in the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments and details how FDA‚Äôs rules
governing 180-day exclusivity have evolved. 
The chapter examines how the 180-day
exclusivity has been triggered, and it also
reviews the agreements that were obtained
through the study that affect the triggering of
the 180-day exclusivity. 
 
The Shifting Regulatory
Landscape Implementing the
180-Day Exclusivity Period
FDA rules implementing the 180-day
exclusivity have changed over the last
several years.  This section describes the
FDA‚Äôs initial approach to implementing the
180-day exclusivity through the ‚Äúsuccessful
defense‚Äù requirement and the current rules
that no longer require a successful defense. 
The section then discusses the FDA‚Äôs
regulations governing what constitutes a
decision of a ‚Äúcourt‚Äù and ‚Äúcommercial
marketing‚Äù sufficient to trigger the first
generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity. 
Finally, it discusses recent developments
surrounding the awarding of ‚Äúshared‚Äù
exclusivity to multiple generic applicants.
Successful Defense Requirement
In October 1994, the FDA issued
final regulations governing how it would
award the 180-day exclusivity period to
generic applicants.5  FDA regulations
required that, to obtain the 180-day
exclusivity, the first generic applicant had to
defend successfully against a patent claim of
the brand-name company.6  The FDA
asserted that only those generic applicants
that had devoted considerable time and
money to defend successfully the patent
infringement lawsuit were entitled to be the
first and only generic company on the
market for 180 days.  The FDA reasoned
that a first generic applicant that a brand-

Prior to this time, the FDA used an approach similar to that
outlined in these regulations.

name company had not sued might have an
incentive to delay marketing.  This delay
would prolong the period of no generic
competition, because other generic products
may not be approved until the first generic
product begins commercial marketing.7
These regulations were challenged in
Mova v. Shalala, a case involving the brand-
name drug product Glynase.8  Mova
Pharmaceuticals was the first generic
applicant for Glynase.  Pharmacia &
Upjohn, the brand-name company, sued
Mova for patent infringement within the
requisite 45-day period, thus initiating the
30-month stay on FDA approval of Mova‚Äôs
application.  Pharmacia did not sue the
second generic applicant, Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, for the same drug product
within 45 days of being notified; thus, the
30-month stay was not triggered.  FDA was
about to approve Mylan‚Äôs ANDA prior to
the expiration of Mova‚Äôs 30-month-stay, but
before the district court had ruled on the
merits of patent infringement case against
Mova, the first generic applicant.  Mova
therefore sued the FDA to delay the effective
date of the approval of Mylan‚Äôs application
until Mova had won its patent infringement
suit or begun commercial marketing of its
generic product.
The district court granted a
preliminary injunction against the FDA on
January 23, 1997, requiring the FDA to
delay approval of Mylan until after Mova‚Äôs
180 days of exclusivity took effect.  This
ruling rejected FDA‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccessful defense‚Äù
requirement as inconsistent with the plain
language of the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments.9  The Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the
District Court‚Äôs ruling in its April 1998
decision.10
The FDA revoked the ‚Äúsuccessful
defense‚Äù requirement and now makes
exclusivity decisions on a case-by-case basis
applying the literal words of the statute.11 
The FDA also has proposed new regulations
to address issues that these court decisions
have raised.12  This rulemaking proceeding
has been pending since August 1999. 
Definition of the ‚ÄúCourt‚Äù As
Used in the 180-Day Marketing
Exclusivity Provision
The FDA originally interpreted the
definition of a court that would trigger 180-
day exclusivity to be ‚Äúthe court that enters
final judgment from which no appeal can be
or has been taken.‚Äù13  In Mylan
7 See 54 Fed. Reg. 28872 (Jul. 10, 1989).

(unpublished opinion), in dicta, ‚ÄúWe note that the Fourth
Circuit recently came to the same conclusion in an
unpublished opinion.‚Äù  Mova, 140 F.3d at 1069.

guidance for industry entitled ‚Äú180-Day Generic Drug
Exclusivity Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act‚Äù (June 1998),
describing its approach to 180-day exclusivity in light of
Mova and Granutec.

Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Shalala,14 the
District Court for the District of Columbia
found FDA‚Äôs interpretation of ‚Äúcourt‚Äù to be
incorrect; the court instead held that ‚Äúcourt‚Äù
means ‚Äúdistrict court.‚Äù  The FDA amended
its rules to implement the Mylan decision by
defining the ‚Äúcourt‚Äù decision that triggers
the running of the 180-day marketing
exclusivity period as the decision of a
district court.  This definition applies,
however, only to ANDAs containing
paragraph IV certifications filed with the
FDA after March 2000.  Thus, if a generic
applicant filed its ANDA with the paragraph
IV certification prior to March 2000, the
definition of a court will remain ‚Äúthe court
that enters final judgment from which no
appeal can be or has been taken.‚Äù15
Triggers for the 180-Day
Exclusivity Period
Prior to the Mova court of appeals
decision on April 14, 1998, the FDA had
granted the 180-day exclusivity to 3 generic
applicants for drug products covered by 3
NDAs.16  In each case, a court had decided
that the patent was invalid or not infringed
such that the generic applicant had
‚Äúsuccessfully defended‚Äù the patent litigation
suit.  Each of these grants of the 180-day
exclusivity occurred prior to 1991 and
involved drugs not included in the scope of
the study. 
Since Mova, the FDA has granted the
180-day exclusivity to the first generic
applicant for 31 drug products.17  Table 5-1
categorizes these grants of exclusivity by the
triggering mechanism (either by commercial
marketing or the decision of a court) as of
June 1, 2002.

Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug,

also discusses the definition of a court for purposes of
when the 30-month stay expires, see Chapter 4.
16 This information was provided by the FDA to
the FTC staff.
17 For 8 drug products, the FDA has provided
two or more generic applicants the 180-day exclusivity for
drug products covered by the same NDA, because different
generic applicants had the first ANDA for a particular
strength of the drug product (e.g., 30mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg
tablets).  To ensure no overcounting, the totals referred to
in this section (and throughout the report unless otherwise
noted) relate only to the number of NDAs for which 180-
day exclusivity has been granted.  For each drug product
where this occurred, the same 180-day exclusivity was
activated by the same trigger (i.e., commercial marketing or
a court decision). 
18 For 2 drug products not included in Table 5-1
but within the scope of this study, the first generic
applicant relinquished its eligibility for the 180-day
exclusivity, thus eliminating any delay for subsequent
generic applicants to market their generic products.  In
addition, for 3 other drug products not included in Table 5-
1, but within the scope of the study, the FDA has indicated
that certain generic applicants are eligible for 180-day
exclusivity, but the period has not yet started to run,
because neither trigger has been activated.
61
Trigger:  Commercial
Marketing
For 19 of the 31 drug products in
Table 5-1, the first generic applicant‚Äôs
commercial marketing triggered the running
of the 180-day exclusivity period.  
In 5 of the 19 instances, commercial
marketing occurred when the FDA did not
consider a district court decision sufficient
to trigger the 180-day exclusivity.  In these 5
instances, the generic applicants had
prevailed at the district court and the 30-
month stay period had expired, so that the
FDA approved the generic applicant‚Äôs
ANDA.  Rather than waiting for an appellate
decision, the generic applicants began
commercial marketing.  In each of these
instances, the generic applicant ultimately
prevailed in the appellate court, but
commercial marketing, not a court decision,
triggered the 180-day exclusivity.
For another 5 of the 19 drug products
in Table 5-1, the first generic applicant was
not sued.  Thus, the only available trigger for
the 180-day exclusivity period was the first
generic applicant‚Äôs commercial marketing.19 
In each of these instances, the first generic
applicant began commercial marketing soon
after receiving FDA approval.  For 3 of
these 5 drug products, the second generic
applicant was approved at the end of the
180-day exclusivity period, and there was
not a second generic applicant for the other 2
drug products.  
In 8 of the 19 instances, the brand-
name company and the generic applicant
settled the patent litigation and the generic
applicant‚Äôs commercial marketing triggered
the 180-day exclusivity.  These 8 settlements
can be grouped into 4 categories:
‚Ä¢
For 3 drug products, the generic
applicant entered an interim settlement with
the brand-name company.  Following
termination of the settlement and FDA
approval, the generic applicant was granted
180-day exclusivity.20
‚Ä¢
For 2 drug products, the generic
applicant obtained a license to use the
patents that were subject to the paragraph IV
certification prior to the patent‚Äôs expiration. 
The generic applicant then obtained FDA
approval and began marketing the generic
product that was the subject of its ANDA
19 There was one other drug product for which
the first applicant was not sued, but its 180-day exclusivity
was triggered by a court decision favorable to the second
generic applicant.  In this case, the FDA had not approved
the first applicant‚Äôs ANDA, but the second generic
applicant appeared to be ready to market ‚Äì except that it
had to wait for the running of the first applicant‚Äôs 180-day
period.  That the 180-day exclusivity had not run for the
first generic applicant, because its ANDA had not yet been
approved, delayed FDA approval of the second generic
applicant‚Äôs ANDA.  To remedy this problem, the second
generic applicant sought a court decision of non-
infringement to activate the ‚Äúcourt decision‚Äù trigger.  The
district court hearing this declaratory judgment action
dismissed the case for lack of case or controversy, because
the brand-name company indicated that it would not sue
the generic applicant for infringement.  The second generic
applicant argued that this constituted a ‚Äúcourt decision‚Äù
sufficient to trigger the 180-day period.  The  Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed and ruled that
a district court‚Äôs earlier dismissal of the second generic
applicant case for lack of case or controversy activated the
court decision trigger and, thus, started the running of the
first generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity.  See Teva
Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. v. FDA, 182 F.3d 1003 (D.C.
Cir. 1999).  There is some uncertainty regarding whether
this reasoning would apply to trigger the 180-day
exclusivity in the future.
20 See Abbott Labs., supra n 3.
62
(see drug products A and C in Table 3-2).21 
‚Ä¢
For 2 drug products, the settlement
involved a supply agreement allowing the
generic applicant to market the brand-name
company‚Äôs product as a generic prior to
patent expiration (see drug product K in
Table 3-3,22 and the description of the
second supply agreement in the text of
Chapter 3).23
‚Ä¢
For 1 drug product, the settlement
specified a date on which entry of the
generic product could occur, which was
prior to patent expiration (see drug product
L in Table 3-3).24
In the last of the 19 instances in
which commercial marketing triggered the
180-day exclusivity, commercial marketing
began after the brand-name company
dismissed the patent suit upon determining
the ANDA did not infringe the brand-name
product.
Trigger:  Court Decision
For 12 out of the 31 drug products,
the FDA granted 180-day exclusivity to a
generic applicant following a court decision
of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
Other than the 2 drug products involved in
the challenge to the FDA‚Äôs successful
defense requirement,25 in most instances the
court that activated the court decision trigger
was an appellate court decision.  More
recently, in 2 of the 12 cases, a district court
decision has triggered the running of the
180-day exclusivity.  In one case, the FDA
approved the ANDA after 21 days of the
180-day period had already run, and in the
other case, FDA approval came 120 days
into the 180-day period, thus shortening the
effective life of the 180-day period.
Effect of 180-Day Exclusivity
on FDA Approval of
Subsequent Eligible Generic
Applicants
As noted in the introduction, in
addition to encouraging entry by the first
generic applicant, the 180-day exclusivity
can delay when the FDA approves any
subsequent eligible generic application that
also contains a paragraph IV certification.  If
the 180-day exclusivity for the first generic
applicant does not run, then the FDA may
not approve any subsequent eligible generic
applicants.  Once the 180-day exclusivity
21 The generic applicant that was party to the
remaining license agreements in Table 3-2 did not receive
the 180-day exclusivity for one of 2 reasons: (1) the
agreement was executed at a time when the FDA required
the first applicant to defend successfully the patent
infringement suit; having failed to do so, they were
ineligible for 180-day exclusivity, or (2) the license has not
yet taken effect, because of a waiting period in the
agreement, such that commercial marketing has not yet
occurred.
22 See Letter to Deborah A. Jaskot, Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, FDA Docket No. 00P-1446/CP1
(Feb. 6, 2001).
23 Although the 180-day exclusivity has run in
these 2 instances, there is some uncertainty as to whether
commercial marketing by the first generic applicant of the
brand-name company‚Äôs product will always activate the
commercial marketing trigger.
24  In most cases, the generic applicant that was
the party to the remaining settlements in Table 3-3
(settlements with brand payments), did not obtain the 180-
day exclusivity because entry did not occur until patent
expiration, thus the generic applicant was ineligible for the
180-day exclusivity.
25 See Mova and Granutec, supra n. 8-10 and
accompanying text.
63
runs, the FDA may approve any additional
generic ANDAs that have been filed and
meet regulatory requirements.  
As discussed in Chapter 3, 14 of the
20 of the settlement agreements obtained
through the study, at the time they were
executed, had the potential to ‚Äúpark‚Äù the first
generic applicant‚Äôs 180-day exclusivity for
some period of time, thus preventing FDA
approval of any subsequent eligible
applicants.26  These agreements include the 4
license agreements with a waiting period
before the license took effect (drug products
A, E, F, and H in Table 3-2), the 2 supply
agreements described in the text of Chapter
3, and settlements with brand payments
(drug products I through P in Table 3-3). 
Ten brand-name companies and 10 generic
companies used agreements with respect
to14 drug products.
In addition to the 20 final settlement
agreements, there were 4 interim settlement
agreements pursuant to which the patent
litigation continued, but the parties agreed
upon certain conditions until the patent
litigation was resolved.  The Commission
has challenged interim settlements for 3
drug products.  In those agreements, the
Commission alleged that the brand-name
drug company paid the first generic
applicant not to enter the market, thereby
retaining its (unused) 180-day marketing
exclusivity and precluding the FDA from
approving any eligible subsequent generic
applicants.27  
Between April 1999 (shortly after
FTC investigations in this area became
public) and the end of the period covered by
this study, brand-name companies and first
generic applicants have not entered
agreements similar to the interim agreements
challenged by the FTC.
26 Whether FDA was actually prevented from
approving subsequent eligible generic applicants depends
on a number of factors, including whether there were
subsequent generic applicant(s) and the result of any patent
litigation with those applicants.

Chapter 6  FDA Citizen Petitions and Generic Drug Applications
Introduction
This chapter reviews FDA
regulations concerning the use of citizen
petitions.  It also examines the citizen
petitions that brand-name companies have
filed about drug products in this study, and
discusses their effect on the development of
generic drug competition for these drug
products.
The FDA has generally resolved the
issues raised by the citizen petitions that
brand-name companies file about drug
products in this study in a timely manner,
and in most instances prior to a district court
ruling on the merits of the patent
infringement litigation.  Thus, for drug
products in the study, citizen petitions that
have been answered by the FDA have not
delayed generic competition.
No general conclusions about the use
of citizen petitions can be drawn from this
study, however, because it did not examine
citizen petitions filed in connection with
ANDAs that contained paragraph I, II, or III
certifications.  Citizen petitions may have a
greater potential to delay generic
competition in those circumstances, in
which no 30-month stay would be
applicable.
FDA Regulations Governing
Citizen Petitions
The FDA has several informal and
formal mechanisms by which it can be
contacted on a particular issue (including via
letter, fax, email or meeting).  A formal
procedure, which has been used by both
brand-name and generic pharmaceutical
companies, is the filing of a citizen petition.1 
The FDA can be petitioned on any matter or
issue which is within the Agency's
jurisdiction.
The petition can request that the
Commissioner issue, amend, or revoke a
regulation or order, or take or refrain from
taking any other form of administrative
action.  The Commissioner must furnish a
response to a petitioner within 180 days of
receipt of the petition.2  The FDA's reply
must approve, deny, or provide a tentative
response.  If the FDA provides a tentative
response, it must indicate why the agency
has been unable to reach a decision on the
petition and may indicate when a final
response may be furnished.3  Unlike
ordinary correspondence, the FDA treats the
response to a citizen petition as the official
position of the agency.4
Individuals and companies often use
the formal citizen petition process to raise
issues regarding the safety and efficacy of
pharmaceuticals.  Brand-name companies,
for example, have petitioned the FDA on
issues relating to bioequivalence for
particular generic drugs.

FDA on the potential for such petitions, on
occasion, to mask anticompetitive strategies. 
The FTC staff has suggested changes to the
FDA‚Äôs proposed rules governing citizen
petitions that might reduce the potential for
regulatory abuse.5  The FTC staff comment
explained there is a potential for
anticompetitive abuse of nearly any
regulatory process.6  To delay competition
may be a lucrative strategy for an incumbent,
especially in an industry in which entry is
regulated, such as pharmaceuticals. 
Improper petitioning may be appealing in
part because it can be used against any size
firm, regardless of relative resources of the
parties.  The cost of filing an improper
citizen petition may be trivial compared to
the value of securing a delay in a rival‚Äôs
entry into a lucrative market.7  
The Noerr-Pennington doctrine often
protects participation in the regulatory
process from antitrust scrutiny.8  As
discussed in Chapter 4, in its simplest terms,
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine shields
private parties from antitrust liability when
they engage in concerted but genuine efforts
to influence governmental action, even
though the conduct is undertaken with an
anticompetitive intent and purpose.  If
regulatory intervention (or a series of
interventions) is used, however, to impede
competition, antitrust concerns may be
raised if not shielded by Noerr-Pennington.9  
One of the recommendations in the
FTC Staff Comment on Citizen Petitions
was that the FDA consider requiring
notification of whether the citizen petitioner
has received, or will receive, consideration
for filing the citizen petition and
identification of the party furnishing the
consideration.  This information may be
important in evaluating the competitive
effect of the petition.
The Use of Citizen Petitions
About Drug Products for
Which an ANDA Containing a
Paragraph IV Certification
Was Filed
Each brand-name company was
required to state, for each drug product
included in the study for which the company
has been notified that an ANDA containing
a paragraph IV certification has been filed
with the FDA, whether the company has
filed, or contributed to the filing of, in whole
or in part (e.g., provided funds, legal or
regulatory assistance to support the filing), a
citizen petition with FDA concerning an
ANDA related to that drug product and to
identify the FDA docket number assigned to
such citizen petition.

67
Of the 104 drug products included in
this study, brand-name companies filed
citizen petitions relating to generic versions
of 12 drug products.  The data showed that
for 1 drug product, the brand-name company
filed 3 citizen petitions against different
generic applicants; each petition sought
different relief.  For 2 other drug products,
the brand-name company filed 2 citizen
petitions, each seeking different relief. 
Thus, brand-name companies filed a total of
16 separate citizen petitions relating to the
104 drug products included in the study.  
In each case, the brand-name
company was the author of the petition and
there was no effort on behalf of the company
to withhold its identity from the FDA.  
For 11 of the 12 drug products
covered by citizen petitions, the brand-name
company that had filed the citizen petition
also had either settled the patent
infringement litigation with an agreement
that contained a brand payment (see Chapter
3), filed a late-issued patent to obtain a
second 30-month stay (see Chapter 4), or has
patent litigation pending in which the brand
company has claimed the ANDA infringes
more than one patent (see Chapter 4). 
Table 6-1 breaks down the type of
request that was included in each petition.

Almost 50 percent of the citizen
petitions requested that the FDA require
additional bioequivalence studies before
approving the generic applicant‚Äôs ANDA. 
Of these 7 petitions regarding
bioequivalence, the FDA denied 3 of these
petitions, granted 1, granted and denied 1 in
part, and 2 petitions were pending as of June
1, 2002.  In each case in which the petition
was denied, the brand-name company also
had initiated patent infringement litigation
against the generic applicant.  
In the 5 cases in which the FDA
ruled on the merits of the bioequivalence
issues raised by the petition, it did so prior to
a district court ruling on the merits of the
infringement litigation and prior to the
expiration of the 30-month stay.  Thus, the
filing of the citizen petition in these cases
did not affect the generic product‚Äôs entry. 
For the other 2 bioequivalence petitions, the
FDA has not yet approved the generic
applicant‚Äôs ANDA.   
In the second category of citizen
petitions described in Table 6-1, brand-name
companies requested the FDA refrain from
approving a generic version of the drug
product unless the generic company certified
68
to a new patent that was listed after the
generic applicant had filed its ANDA.  The
FDA denied one of the petitions, and in the
other two, the petitions were withdrawn
because of a merger or because the generic
applicant made the requisite patent
certification.  In each case, the citizen
petition did not affect when the FDA
approved (if it did) the generic applicants‚Äô
ANDAs.
In the third category of citizen
petitions described in Table 6-1, brand-name
companies requested FDA redefine dosage
forms with varying release mechanisms as
distinct dosage forms.  If the FDA were to
grant this category of petitions, the generic
applicant also would have been required to
file a suitability petition that sought an FDA
ruling that the two dosage forms were
bioequivalent.  In other words, it would have
been procedurally more difficult for the
generic applicant to have its ANDA
approved in a timely manner. 
The FDA denied both of these
petitions.  In each case, the brand-name
company had sued the generic applicant for
patent infringement, and the citizen petition
was resolved by the FDA within the 30-
month stay period.  Thus, the petition had no
effect on the timing of generic drug
approval.  
The last 4 citizen petitions dealt with
issues unique to the underlying drug
product.  In one case, the petition was
withdrawn, in another the FDA responded to
the petition in an informal manner that
satisfied the parties involved, in the third
instance, the petition was denied, and in the
fourth case, the petition was pending as of
June 1, 2002.  In the first 3 cases, the
resolution of the citizen petition did not
effect market entry by the generic applicant.  
Conclusions
The citizen petitions related to drug
products in the study that have been resolved
did not affect the timing of generic entry. 
The FDA has addressed the issues raised by
those citizen petitions in a timely manner
and prior to the expiration of the 30-month
stay related to the underlying patent
infringement litigation.
No general conclusions about the use
of citizen petitions, however, can be drawn
from this study, however, because it only
examined citizen petitions filed in
connection with ANDAs that contained
paragraph IV certifications.

drug included on the list is to be published by the Secretary, the Secretary shall, in
revisions made under clause (ii), include such information for such drug. 
(B) 
A drug approved for safety and effectiveness under subsection (c) of this section or approved
under this subsection shall, for purposes of this subsection, be considered to have been published
under subparagraph (A) on the date of its approval or September 24, 1984, whichever is later. 
(C) 
If the approval of a drug was withdrawn or suspended for grounds described in the first sentence of
subsection (e) of this section or was withdrawn or suspended under paragraph (6) or if the
Secretary determines that a drug has been withdrawn from sale for safety or effectiveness reasons,
it may not be published in the list under subparagraph (A) or, if the withdrawal or suspension
occurred after its publication in such list, it shall be immediately removed from such list - 
(i) 
for the same period as the withdrawal or suspension under subsection (e) of this section or

rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug when administered at the same molar dose
of the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose
or multiple doses; or 
(ii) 
the extent of absorption of the drug does not show a significant difference from the extent
of absorption of the listed drug when administered at the same molar dose of the
therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or
multiple doses and the difference from the listed drug in the rate of absorption of the drug
A-12
is intentional, is reflected in its proposed labeling, is not essential to the attainment of
effective body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medically
insignificant for the drug.

section is in effect, the applicant shall establish and maintain such records, and make such reports to the
Secretary, of data relating to clinical experience and other data or information, received or otherwise
obtained by such applicant with respect to such drug, as the Secretary may by general regulation, or by
order with respect to such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding that such records and reports are
necessary in order to enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a determination, whether there is or
may be ground for invoking subsection (e) of this section. Regulations and orders issued under this
subsection and under subsection (i) of this section shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the
medical profession and the interests of patients and shall provide, where the Secretary deems it to be
appropriate, for the examination, upon request, by the persons to whom such regulations or orders are
applicable, of similar information received or otherwise obtained by the Secretary. 
(2) 
Every person required under this section to maintain records, and every person in charge or custody thereof,
shall, upon request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee
at all reasonable times to have access to and copy and verify such records. 
       (l) Public disclosure of safety and effectiveness data

                Office. 
       (n)   Scientific advisory panels 
(1) 
For the purpose of providing expert scientific advice and recommendations to the Secretary regarding a
clinical investigation of a drug or the approval for marketing of a drug under this section or section 262 of
title 42, the Secretary shall establish panels of experts or use panels of experts established before November
21, 1997, or both. 
(2) 
The Secretary may delegate the appointment and oversight authority granted under section 394 of this title
to a director of a center or successor entity within the Food and Drug Administration. 
(3) 
The Secretary shall make appointments to each panel established under paragraph (1) so that each panel
shall consist of - 
(A) 
members who are qualified by training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
the drugs to be referred to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess skill and experience in
the development, manufacture, or utilization of such drugs; 
(B) 
members with diverse expertise in such fields as clinical and administrative medicine, pharmacy,
pharmacology, pharmacoeconomics, biological and physical sciences, and other related
professions; 
(C) 
a representative of consumer interests, and a representative of interests of the drug manufacturing
industry not directly affected by the matter to be brought before the panel; and 
(D) 
two or more members who are specialists or have other expertise in the particular disease or
condition for which the drug under review is proposed to be indicated. 
Scientific, trade, and consumer organizations shall be afforded an opportunity to nominate individuals for
appointment to the panels. No individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in
the administration of this chapter may be a voting member of any panel. The Secretary shall designate one of the
members of each panel to serve as chairman thereof. 
(4) 
Each member of a panel shall publicly disclose all conflicts of interest that member may have with the work
to be undertaken by the panel. No member of a panel may vote on any matter where the member or the
immediate family of such member could gain financially from the advice given to the Secretary. The
Secretary may grant a waiver of any conflict of interest requirement upon public disclosure of such conflict
of interest if such waiver is necessary to afford the panel essential expertise, except that the Secretary may
not grant a waiver for a member of a panel when the member's own scientific work is involved. 
(5) 
The Secretary shall, as appropriate, provide education and training to each new panel member before such
member participates in a panel's activities, including education regarding requirements under this chapter
and related regulations of the Secretary, and the administrative processes and procedures related to panel
meetings. 
(6) 
Panel members (other than officers or employees of the United States), while attending meetings or
conferences of a panel or otherwise engaged in its business, shall be entitled to receive compensation for
each day so engaged, including traveltime, at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, but not to exceed the daily
equivalent of the rate in effect for positions classified above grade GS-15 of the General Schedule. W hile
serving away from their homes or regular places of business, panel members may be allowed travel
expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as authorized by section 5703 of title 5, for persons in
the Government service employed intermittently. 
A-14
(7) 
The Secretary shall ensure that scientific advisory panels meet regularly and at appropriate intervals so that
any matter to be reviewed by such a panel can be presented to the panel not more than 60 days after the
matter is ready for such review. Meetings of the panel may be held using electronic communication to
convene the meetings. 
(8) 
Within 90 days after a scientific advisory panel makes recommendations on any matter under its review, the
Food and Drug Administration official responsible for the matter shall review the conclusions and
recommendations of the panel, and notify the affected persons of the final decision on the matter, or of the
reasons that no such decision has been reached. Each such final decision shall be documented including the
rationale for the decision.

For each Drug Product for which the company has been notified that an ANDA
containing a paragraph IV certification had been filed with the FDA, state the company‚Äôs sales,5 in units
and dollars, by each finished dosage form for each calendar year since, and including, the year the
company was notified of the filing of such ANDA.  If the company has its own generic version of the
Drug Product, separate the sales for the brand-name product and the generic product.
5.
For each Drug Product for which the company has been notified that an ANDA
containing a paragraph IV certification has been filed with FDA, state whether the company has filed, or
contributed to the filing of, in whole or in part (e.g., provided funds, legal or regulatory assistance to

Specifications in the Special Orders Sent to Generic Companies
In addition to routine questions about the name, address, and incorporation date of the responding company
and its subsidiaries, and the name, business address, and official capacity of the official supervising the
company‚Äôs response, the FTC asked generic companies (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) to provide answers to the following
five questions:
1.
Submit all agreements between the company and any person6 (including corporations or
other business entities acquired since the agreement(s) was (were) executed after December 31, 1994,7
relating to8 any ANDA involving any Drug Product.9  Examples of such agreements include, but are not
limited to: (a) patent litigation settlements (either full or partial) between the company and any Brand-
Name Company10; (b) agreements between the company and any other person related to the filing (or
non-filing) of an ANDA by the company involving any Drug Product; (c) licensing agreements entered
into with any Brand-Name Company; and (d) agreements related to any acquisition, divestiture, joint
venture, alliance, license or merger by the company of any business involving the research, development,
manufacture or sale of any Drug Product that is the subject of an ANDA.  The company is not required
to submit purchase orders for raw material supplies, equipment and facility contracts, or employment or
consulting contracts, nor is the company required to submit agreements executed after the company had
begun commercial marketing of the generic Drug Product corresponding to the ANDA for which it had
received FDA approval.  The company also is not required to submit information that has already been
submitted to the Commission pursuant to the Premerger Notification Rules (16 CFR 801-803 (1998))
and Section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a), or Sections 6, 9, 13, and 20 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 46, 49, 53, and 57b-1), although the company must identify such
information as having previously submitted.  For any such agreement submitted, also submit all studies,
surveys, analyses and reports which were prepared by or for any officer(s) or director(s) (or, in the case
of unincorporated entities, individuals exercising similar functions) that evaluate or analyze the reasons
for making such agreement (or any of the provisions in such agreement), and indicate (if not contained in
the document itself) the date of preparation, and the name and title of each individual who prepared each
such document. 
 
11  The term ‚Äúsales‚Äù means net sales, i.e., total sales after deducting discounts, returns, allowances and excise taxes. 
‚ÄúSales‚Äù includes sales of the Drug Product whether manufactured by the company itself or purchased from sources outside the
company and resold by the company in the same manufactured form as purchased.
A-23
2.
Identify and list all lawsuits (including the court, date filed, docket number, parties,
current or final status (including dates), current or final docket sheet, and any reporter cites) to which the
company is or was a party involving an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification.  In those cases in
which the company is not the sole defendant, describe how litigation expenses are or have been
distributed among the defendants.  
3.
Identify when the company first began commercial marketing of a generic version of any
Drug Product approved by the FDA, by each finished dosage form (or, if applicable, indicate that no
such commercial marketing has occurred).  Identify when the company received tentative and final
approvals from the FDA for such Drug Product. 
4.
Identify each instance in which the company has asserted before a court or before the
FDA that a patent was improperly or untimely listed in the Orange Book as defined in 21 U.S.C. 355(b)
or (c).  For each such assertion, submit the pleading(s) in which such assertion was made and any
responsive pleading(s).
5.
For each Drug Product for which the company has filed an ANDA containing a paragraph
IV certification, state the company‚Äôs sales11 (if any), in units and dollars, by each finished dosage form
for each calendar year since, and including, the year the company received FDA approval of such
ANDA.

FTC Staff‚Äôs Citizen Petition on the Listability of 
Certain Patents in the Orange Book
May 16, 2001

CITIZEN PETITION
The Bureau of Competition and Policy Planning Staff of the Federal Trade Commission (‚ÄúFTC‚Äù)
submit this Citizen Petition to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs pursuant to 21 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 10.25(a)
and 10.30 concerning certain issues relating to patent listings in the FDA‚Äôs Approved Drug Products
with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the ‚ÄúOrange Book‚Äù).  We request that the FDA clarify these
issues, on an expedited basis, via industry guidance or other means that the FDA considers appropriate.
In recent years, the FTC has gained significant experience concerning competition in the
pharmaceutical industry.  In particular, the Commission has brought a number of antitrust enforcement
activities affecting both the branded and generic drug industries.  Last year, the Commission announced
plans to conduct an extensive study ‚Äì pursuant to Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 46(b) ‚Äì of
U.S. generic drug competition (the ‚ÄúStudy‚Äù).  The Study will enable the FTC to provide a more complete
picture of how generic drug competition has developed under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  See 66 Fed. Reg.
12512 (Feb. 27, 2001); 65 Fed. Reg. 61334 (Oct. 17, 2000); ‚ÄúFTC to Study Generic Drug Competition,‚Äù
(Oct. 11, 2000) 
<http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/10/genericdrug.htm>.  The Office of Management and Budget (‚ÄúOMB‚Äù)
cleared the Study on April 6, 2001, following the closure of two public comment periods.  The FTC will
obtain factual information for the Study from name-brand pharmaceutical and generic drug
manufacturers through interrogatories and document requests.
The Study seeks information concerning a variety of practices that may have an impact on
competition in the pharmaceutical industry, including the possible improper or untimely listing of
patents by name-brand pharmaceutical companies in the Orange Book.  In this connection, the Study
requests name-brand companies to ‚Äú[i]dentify all patents that the company has filed in the Orange Book
and the date of listing (regardless of whether currently listed in the Orange Book) relating to each Drug
Product for which the company has been notified of the filing of an ANDA by another person [, and
indicate] if the patent(s) was (were) filed in the Orange Book after the company received approval of the
New Drug Application. . . .‚Äù  66 Fed. Reg. at 12520.  The Study also requests generic drug companies to
1  The interpretation in this regulation of the term ‚Äúdrug‚Äù as meaning the ‚Äúdrug product‚Äù is consistent with the FDA‚Äôs
position in Pfizer v. FDA.  753 F. Supp. 171 (D. Md. 1989).
A-25
‚Äú[i]dentify each instance in which the company has asserted before a court or before the FDA that a
patent was improperly or untimely listed as defined in 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(b) or (c).‚Äù  Id. at 12521.  This
information is crucial to determine how often and when name-brand companies have filed new patents
after the FDA has approved the drug product.  Id.  at 12517.  The consequences of such filings are
significant, because as ‚Äúlong as the patent remains listed, ANDA applicants must still make a paragraph
IV certification, potentially triggering the 30-month stay of FDA approval of generic drug applications.‚Äù 
Brief of Federal Trade Commission as Amicus Curiae In American Bioscience, Inc., v. Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company (Sept. 1, 2001) at 10, <http://www./ftc.gov/os/2000/09/amicusbrief.pdf>.  Thus, such
listings can affect when generic competition starts.  66 Fed. Reg. at 12517.
During the public comment period prior to OMB approval of the Study, the FTC received several
comments that supported the Commission‚Äôs proposed examination of Orange Book patent listing
practices.  For example, Microbix indicated that generic competition can be delayed on name-brand drug
products if name-brand companies newly list ‚Äúirrelevant and undefendable‚Äù patents in the Orange Book
near the expiration of the name-brand drug product‚Äôs original patents.  Generic competition is delayed
because the FDA is prohibited from approving a generic version of the name-brand product for 30
months in order to resolve litigation over the newly-listed patents.  Microbix Comment at 2 (Dec. 18,
2000).  See also General Motors Comment (Dec. 18, 2000) at 2, NACDS Comment at 1-2 (Dec. 18,
2000).  These comments are available on the FTC‚Äôs website at
<http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/genericdrugstudy/index.htm>. 
As the FTC proceeds with the Study and continues to investigate methods of competition in the
pharmaceutical industry, it would be helpful if the FDA provided further guidance concerning the proper
application of its regulations that require certain patents to be listed in the Orange Book.  We describe
below our interpretation of the pertinent statutory provisions, regulations, and the FDA statements
regarding particular drug products.  We seek your views on our interpretations.  For example, we seek
clarification of the FDA‚Äôs response to a prior Citizen Petition submitted on behalf of Apotex concerning
its pending abbreviated new drug application (‚ÄúANDA‚Äù) for the marketing of a generic form of Paxil,
which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline (‚ÄúGSK‚Äù, formerly SmithKline Beecham).  The Apotex Citizen
Petition was submitted to the FDA on February 3, 2000 in Docket No. 00P-0499/CP1.  The FDA
responded to that petition on November 21, 2000 (the ‚ÄúCitizen Petition Response‚Äù (attached)). 
Two-Prong Listing Test
First, we seek guidance concerning the criteria that a patent must meet before it can be listed in
the Orange Book.  We understand that the governing regulation, 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b), and the statutes
on which it is based, 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1), (c)(2), require that a patent satisfy both of two independent
prongs before qualifying for Orange Book listing.  To satisfy the first prong, a patent must claim a drug
product1 or method of using a drug product that is the subject of a new drug application (‚ÄúNDA‚Äù) or an
amendment or supplement to it.  To satisfy the second prong, the patentee must be able to reasonably
assert a claim for infringement of the listed patent against someone who manufactures, uses or sells the
drug product that is the subject of the NDA. In addition, we understand that the language in 21 C.F.R.
2   See ‚ÄúFederal Defendant‚Äôs Notice of Change in Position,‚Äù Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., v. Biovail Corp. (Case No.
01-6194-CV-DIMITROULEAS) (S.D. Fla.) (pleading filed on Feb. 28, 2001).
A-26
¬ß 314.53(b) that follows the two-prong test (i.e., the text following the first full sentence of that section)
is merely explanatory language and does not expand the scope of this regulation.  Please comment on
whether our understanding comports with the FDA‚Äôs interpretation of 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) and 21
U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1), (c)(2).
Listing of Patents Claiming an Unapproved Aspect of an Approved Drug
Second, we seek guidance concerning whether under the first prong, an NDA holder can list a
patent claiming an unapproved aspect of an approved drug.  The regulation requires that a patent must
‚Äúclaim[] the drug or a method of using the drug that is the subject of the new drug application . . . .‚Äù  21
C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53 (b).  We read this provision to require that after a drug is approved, a listed patent must
claim the drug product as approved by the FDA in all respects.  We understand that any patent claiming
only an unapproved component, an unapproved formulation, or an unapproved use of a drug product
cannot satisfy the first prong.  Similarly, we understand that any patent claiming an aspect of an
approved drug that would require prior FDA approval (e.g., a supplemental NDA) before incorporation
or implementation in a marketed drug product ‚Äì such as a component of the drug, its formulation, a
condition of use, an indication, or labeling information ‚Äì cannot satisfy the first prong.
  
We note that the FDA made statements consistent with this position in a recent patent listing
dispute in federal court between Biovail (name-brand) and Andrx (generic) concerning Biovail‚Äôs Tiazac
product.2  In that court proceeding, the FDA stated its preliminary conclusion that Biovail was required
to file a supplement to its NDA for a change in manufacturing process and formulation that had not been
previously approved. The FDA further clarified that the patent at issue must claim the approved
formulation of Tiazac to be properly listed in the Orange Book.  According to the FDA, to the extent the
patent claimed only the new, unapproved formulation, it was not properly listed.
With respect to the listing of patents on unapproved aspects of an approved drug product, we also
are seeking elaboration concerning the statement in the Citizen Petition Response that ‚Äú[p]atents must be
listed if they claim the drug substance, or active ingredient, of an approved drug product, or if they claim
a drug substance that is the component of such a product.‚Äù  (Response at 6.)  We understand the FDA‚Äôs
statement to be simply a restatement of the first prong and consistent with our understanding of the first
prong and the criteria for listing drug substance patents set forth above.  We understand that any patent
claiming only an unapproved component cannot satisfy prong one.  Likewise, we understand that if a
drug substance patent claims only a chemical compound which the FDA has not approved as a
component of an approved drug product, that patent may not be listed.  In particular, we understand this
to be the case even when the claimed unapproved chemical compound differs only in its water of
hydration from an approved component.  
Please comment on whether our understanding comports with the FDA‚Äôs interpretation of 21
C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1), (c)(2), and the related statements in the Citizen Petition
Response. 
A-27
Definition of ‚ÄúDrug Product‚Äù
Third, we seek guidance on the meaning of the term ‚Äúdrug product‚Äù as defined in 21 C.F.R.
¬ß 314.3(b) and as applied in 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b), and the effect of that definition on the analysis of the
second prong.  We understand that the relevant ‚Äúdrug product‚Äù is only that product which is the subject
of the NDA as approved by the FDA.  Consequently, in analyzing ‚Äúwhether a claim of patent
infringement can reasonably be asserted‚Äù against a drug product, one may only consider the drug product
in the form approved by the FDA.  We understand that for any aspect of a drug product which is subject
to FDA approval ‚Äì including for instance, a drug product‚Äôs components, formulation, a condition of use,
an indication, or labeling information ‚Äì only the aspects as approved may be considered in the
infringement analysis of the second prong.  Please comment on whether our understanding comports
with the FDA‚Äôs interpretation of 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1), (c)(2).
Listing of Drug Substance Patents
Finally, we seek guidance on whether a patent claiming only a chemical compound that the FDA
has not approved for use as the drug substance in an approved drug product may be listed.  The
regulation requires that in order for a drug substance patent to be listed, it must claim a drug substance
that is a component of a drug product that is the subject of a pending or approved NDA.  See 21 C.F.R.
¬ß 314.53(b) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1), (c)(2).  We understand that if a drug substance patent claims
only a chemical compound which the FDA has not approved as a component of an approved drug
product, that patent may not be listed.  
For example, the Citizen Petition Response states ‚Äú[p]lease note that for purposes of the same
active ingredient requirement in 505(j), FDA considers anhydrous and hemihydrous  forms of drug
substances to be pharmaceutical equivalents and to contain the same active ingredient.‚Äù  (Response at 6,
n. 16.)  We understand the FDA‚Äôs statement to be limited to the issue of whether a drug product,
submitted for approval through an ANDA, satisfies the requirement of 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j) that it contain
the ‚Äúsame active ingredient‚Äù as the reference listed drug, even when the active ingredient of the ANDA
product and the listed drug differ by water of hydration.  For example, in the case of Paxil, the statement
is limited to whether the anhydrate and hemihydrate forms of paroxetine hydrochloride are
pharmaceutically equivalent and considered to be the same active ingredient for purposes of 21 U.S.C.
¬ß 355(j).
We do not read this statement in the Citizen Petition Response as having any bearing on the
requirements for listing patents in the Orange Book as set out in 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 355(b)(1), (c)(2) and 21
C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53 (b).  In particular, we understand the fact that the FDA may consider one chemical
compound pharmaceutically equivalent to, or the same active ingredient as, another chemical compound
for purposes of 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j) does not alter the requirement of 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) that a listed
drug substance patent must claim a component of an approved drug product.  We further understand that
it is possible for a chemical compound to be pharmaceutically equivalent to an approved active
ingredient and considered the same active ingredient for purposes of 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j), but not itself be
approved as a component of the drug product.  For example, although the FDA considers the anhydrous
form of paroxetine hydrochloride to be the same active ingredient as the hemihydrous form of paroxetine
A-28
hydrochloride for purposes of 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j), the anhydrous form is not an approved component of
the drug product, Paxil. 
Please comment on our understanding of 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß  355(b)(1),
(c)(2), and the related statements in the Citizen Petition Response.

Hytrin (terazosin hydrochloride)
Abbott Laboratories (‚ÄúAbbott‚Äù) distributes terazosin hydrochloride (known by the brand name
Hytrin), which is approved for the treatment of hypertension and symptomatic benign prostatic
hyperplasia.1  The FDA approved the Hytrin tablet NDA on August 7, 1987, and the capsule NDA on
December 14, 1994.  Abbott sells the dihydrate form of terazosin hydrochloride (having two associated
water molecules).2

Patent No. 5,294,615 (the ‚Äò615 patent), which claimed an anhydrous form of terazosin hydrochloride, not the dihydrate form sold
by Abbott.  Because the ‚Äò615 patent was untimely listed in the Orange Book after Geneva had filed its tablet ANDA, any suit by
Abbott on the patent would not generate a 30-month stay as to Geneva‚Äôs tablet ANDA.  21 C.F.R. ¬ß314.94(a)(12)(vi); see Abbott

A-30
Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed its ANDAs for terazosin hydrochloride tablets in January
1993 and for capsules in December 1995, seeking approval to market ‚ÄúForm IV‚Äù anhydrous (having no
associated water) terazosin hydrochloride.3  Over the course of several years, Abbott brought five
lawsuits involving several patents that it had listed in the Orange Book.  The priority dates4 of patents-at-
issue in the third, fourth and fifth suits are later than Abbott‚Äôs first marketing of Hytrin, suggesting that
these patents might not cover Hytrin and be valid, because of the ‚Äúon-sale bar‚Äù of patent law. 
Initially Abbott sued Geneva in February 1992, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.
4,251,532 (the ‚Äò532 patent), thereby generating the first 30-month stay.  The ‚Äò532 patent claims the
dihydrate form of terazosin hydrochloride approved by the FDA for sale as Hytrin.  Almost nine months
later, in November 1993, the court dismissed the suit without prejudice, ending the stay.  Abbott brought
another suit against Geneva in September 1994, although it dismissed that suit less than a year later.5 
Abbott filed its third suit in November 1995, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,112,097 (the
‚Äò097 patent) and 5,412,095 (the ‚Äò095 patent), presumably generating another stay.  The ‚Äò097 patent
claimed a pharmaceutical composition containing terazosin hydrochloride, while the ‚Äò095 patent claims
the Form III anhydrate of terazosin hydrochloride (not the dihydrate).  Shortly thereafter, in February
1996, the court dismissed the ‚Äò095 patent from the suit without prejudice.6  Litigation continued with
respect to the ‚Äò097 patent, however, for nearly another year.  Although the ‚Äò097 patent had originally
expired in 1995, before Abbott filed suit, Abbott argued that the Uruguay Round Agreements Act
extended its term to January 21, 1997.  Geneva ultimately prevailed in district court and on appeal by
asserting that the patent expired October 14, 1995.7  
Abbott filed its fourth suit against Geneva in March 1996, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
No. 5,294,615 by Geneva‚Äôs capsule ANDA.  The ‚Äò615 patent claims an anhydrous form of terazosin
hydrochloride, not the dihydrate form sold by Abbott.  Again, shortly after filing, the court dismissed the
suit without prejudice.8  Abbott‚Äôs listing of the ‚Äò615 patent and other patents claiming the anhydrous

in Appendix H.
Abbott filed its fifth suit on June 4, 1996, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,504,207
(the ‚Äò207 patent) by Geneva‚Äôs tablet ANDA.  The ‚Äò207 patent claimed the Form IV anhydrate of
terazosin, used by Geneva in its tablets and capsules, but not by Abbott in Hytrin.  Although Geneva had
filed a paragraph IV certification with respect to the ‚Äò207 patent for both its capsule and tablet ANDAs,
Abbott failed to sue based on the capsule ANDA.  Accordingly, the suit only initiated a 30-month stay
on FDA approval of Geneva‚Äôs tablet ANDA.  That stay expired in October 1998, nearly 70 months after
Abbott initiated its first suit against Geneva.  The district court held the ‚Äò207 patent invalid under the
statutory on-sale bar, and the Federal Circuit affirmed on July 1, 1999.9  
Because no 30-month stay prevented it, the FDA approved Geneva‚Äôs capsule ANDA in March
1998.  Rather than begin marketing, Geneva entered an agreement with Abbott whereby Geneva agreed
not to market its generic tablets or capsules until the ‚Äò207 patent litigation was finally concluded.  In
exchange, Abbott paid Geneva $4.5 million per month.10  Ultimately, Geneva began marketing its
capsules in August 1999.  The Geneva-Abbott agreement, however, gave rise to an FTC investigation,
which concluded in a consent agreement with both Geneva and Abbott.11
Neurontin (gabapentin) Tablets and Capsules
Pfizer Warner-Lambert (Pfizer) distributes gabapentin tablets and capsules12 (known by the brand
name Neurontin), which is approved for treating seizures caused by epilepsy.13  Pfizer‚Äôs patent listings in
the Orange Book and related patent infringement suits demonstrate that the lengthy pendency of a patent
application can generate overlapping 30-month stays that prevent FDA approval of generic products for
more than 30 months ‚Äì in the case of Neurontin capsules, about 53 months.
Pfizer‚Äôs patents covering the gabapentin molecule and the only approved use of gabapentin have
expired.  The generic applicants did not challenge the validity of either patent or attempt to enter before
their expiration.   Pfizer had already listed Patent Nos. 4,894,476 (the ‚Äò476 patent) and 5,084,479 (the
‚Äò479 patent) in the Orange Book at the time the generic applicants first filed ANDAs for the capsule
14  Presumably, the FDA did not require the generic applicants to file paragraph IV certifications for the ‚Äò479 patent,
which claims a method of treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, Huntington‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs diseases,
because the generic applicants did not seek approval for these uses.  21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j)(2)(A)(viii) (if an ANDA applicant does
not seek approval for a method of use claimed in a listed patent, he may submit a statement to that regard, rather than certify to
the patent).  Apotex did submit a paragraph IV certification for the ‚Äò479 patent and Pfizer brought suit.  Warner-Lambert, Co. v.

19  Faulding also was the first generic applicant for the tablet form of gabapentin, which is approved by the FDA under
a different NDA.  Faulding filed its ANDA for tablets 16 months later than the one for capsules.  When Pfizer listed the ‚Äò482
patent in the Orange Book, it did so for both capsules and tablets.  Thus the additional 30-month stay relating to tablets resulted
in a shorter total stay period, 37 months, than the one for capsules of 53 months.

form of gabapentin in 1998.  Pfizer‚Äôs suits for infringement of the ‚Äò476 patent,14 brought against
Faulding and Apotex Corp.15 in June and July 1998, generated the first 30-month stays, which expired in
about December 2000.16  
The subject matter claimed in the ‚Äò476 and the ‚Äò479 patents differs from Neurontin as
manufactured and sold by Pfizer.  Pfizer sells the anhydrate form of gabapentin (having no associated
water molecules),17 but the ‚Äò476 patent claims a monohydrate form of gabapentin (having one associated
water molecule).  The patent explains that the monohydrate is a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù form of gabapentin as compared
to the known, anhydrate form.  Thus, Pfizer obtained the ‚Äò476 patent by asserting that the new
monohydrate is patentably distinct from the anhydrate that it has FDA approval to sell.  The listed ‚Äò479
patent claims ‚Äúa method for treating neurodegenerative diseases‚Äù such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, Huntington‚Äôs and
Parkinson‚Äôs diseases with gabapentin, even though the FDA has approved gabapentin only for treatment
of epilepsy.
 Pfizer received Patent No. 6,054,482 (the ‚Äò482 patent) on April 25, 2000, based on the fourth in
a string of continuation applications18 claiming priority back to 1989, and listed it in the Orange Book. 
Consequently, FDA regulations required the ANDA filers to re-certify to the ‚Äò482 patent.19  The
infringement suits Pfizer brought in June and July 2000 based on those paragraph IV certifications
generated second 30-month stays that extended nearly two years beyond the first stay, until
20  Pfizer‚Äôs suits for infringement of the ‚Äò482 patent have been consolidated in multi-district litigation and are pending.

Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride)
The section of Chapter 4 entitled ‚ÄúOrange Book Patent Listing Practices and Use of Multiple 30-
Month Stays‚Äù describes GlaxoSmithKline‚Äôs (GSK)21 patent listings and infringement suits that caused
the multiple 30-month stays for Paxil.  As explained in Chapter 4, GSK has sued an ANDA filer,
Apotex, for infringement of five patents, thereby generating five overlapping 30-month stays totaling
over five years.  This appendix examines the Orange Book listings by comparing the scope of the five
patents-in-suit to Paxil.
The first patent which GSK listed and sued on was Patent No. 4,721,723 (the ‚Äò723 patent), which
claims paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate, the form of the active ingredient contained in Paxil.  (The
hemihydrate has one water molecule for every two paroxetine molecules incorporated into its crystalline
structure.)
The second and third patents on which GSK sued Apotex were anhydrate patents.  The second
was Patent No. 5,872,132 (the ‚Äò132 patent), which claims paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate (having
no associated water molecules) and so differs from the hemihydrate form sold by GSK.  In fact, the
hemihydrate form is prior art to this patent and, thus, GSK represented to the Patent Office that the
anhydrate is patentably distinct from the hemihydrate.  GSK also sued on Patent No. 6,080,759 (the ‚Äò759
patent), which claims the anhydrate made according to a specified process.  The ‚Äò132 and ‚Äò759 patents
raise the issue of whether polymorph patents should be listed in the Orange Book, discussed in Appendix
H.
The fourth and fifth patents on which GSK sued Apotex were product-by-process patents, raising
the listing issues described in Appendix H.  GSK‚Äôs fourth suit was for infringement of Patent No.
6,113,944 (the ‚Äò944 patent), which claims tablets containing paroxetine made according to a specified
process.  The fifth suit was for infringement of  Patent No. 6,172,233 (the ‚Äò233 patent), which claims
paroxetine hydrochloride made according to specified processes.  The ‚Äò233 patent acknowledges that
paroxetine hydrochloride was well known at the time GSK applied for the patent.  Likewise the ‚Äò944
patent acknowledges that paroxetine tablets were known. In both cases, only the recited process for
making the tablets or compound is asserted to be new.  Moreover,  GSK applied for the ‚Äò233 patent

several years after it began marketing Paxil.  Therefore, Paxil is prior art to this patent, and it can only be
valid if it claims a process other than the FDA-approved process used to make Paxil.22
Platinol (cisplatin)
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Bristol) distributes cisplatin (known by the brand names of Platinol
and Platinol-AQ23), which is approved for treatment of testicular, ovarian and bladder cancer.24  Bristol‚Äôs
patent listings in the Orange Book and related patent infringement suits demonstrate that double-
patenting and lengthy pendency of a patent application can generate an automatic 30-month stay on FDA
approval of generic products close to their otherwise expected approval date.
Bristol holds the exclusive license25 to two patents related to cisplatin, Patent Nos. 4,177,263 (the
‚Äò263 patent) and 5,562,925 (the ‚Äò925 patent).  The ‚Äò263 patent issued on December 4, 1979, and Bristol
eventually listed it in the Orange Book.  That patent claims a method of treating tumor cells by
administering cisplatin.  Prior to expiration of the ‚Äò263 patent on December 4, 1996, three generic
companies26 filed ANDAs for cisplatin containing paragraph III certifications stating that they did not
seek FDA approval for their generic versions until the ‚Äò263 expired.  On October 8, 1996, shortly before
the ‚Äò263 expired, however, the Patent Office issued the ‚Äò925 patent.  Bristol listed this patent in the
Orange Book, which forced the generic applicants to file paragraph IV certifications.  Bristol then
brought infringement suits against the generic applicants, triggering an automatic 30-month stay lasting
until approximately May 1999.27
The ‚Äò925 patent issued from the tenth application in a series of continuation applications
originating with an application filed on April 20, 1970, more than 26 years before the ‚Äò925 patent‚Äôs
issuance.  The ‚Äò263 patent issued from the fourth application in the same family, making the ‚Äò925 patent
28  Pursuant to section 534 of Pub. L. 103-465, the term of a patent granted on an application filed on or after June

application was filed.  35 U.S.C. ¬ß 154.   The application which issued as the ‚Äò925 patent was filed June 2, 1994, prior to the
effective date of this provision.  Therefore, the term of the ‚Äò925 patent is 17 years from the date of issuance (October 8, 2013),
but the term of the patent extending beyond May 8, 2012 was disclaimed.

approval) until five years after the approval of that NCE.  The expectation that generic taxol would be available was created, in
part, by Bristol‚Äôs statements before Congressional committees in 1991 and 1993 that ‚Äúnear-term generic competition for Taxol is

a direct decedent of the ‚Äò263.  Because of its lengthy pendency, the ‚Äò925 was able to issue and generate a
30-month stay just as its direct predecessor, the ‚Äò263, was about to expire.28
The generic applicants successfully defended the patent infringement suits by asserting that the
‚Äò925 patent was invalid for ‚Äúobviousness-type double patenting‚Äù in light of the ‚Äò263 patent.  The ‚Äò925
patent claims ‚Äúa therapeutic composition comprising‚Äù cisplatin.  The generics argued that this
‚Äútherapeutic composition‚Äù was obvious in light of the method of treating tumors using cisplatin claimed
by the ‚Äò263 patent.  (Appendix H explains double-patenting and the surrounding listing issues.)   The
district court agreed, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed on March 23, 200129
(after the 30-month stays had expired).
Taxol (paclitaxel)
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. manufactures and distributes paclitaxel (brand name, Taxol, and
generically known as taxol), which the FDA has approved for treatment of ovarian, breast and lung
cancers and AIDs-related Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma.30  Bristol‚Äôs patent listings in the Orange Book and the
related patent infringement suits demonstrate that invalid patents in combination with the lengthy
pendency of a patent application can potentially generate an additional 30-month stay.
During the 1980's, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored research and clinical trials of
taxol‚Äôs effects on numerous cancers.  Eventually, the agency sought a commercial partner to bring a
taxol-based drug to market, and in 1991 the NCI entered a Cooperative Research and Development
Agreement (‚ÄúCRADA‚Äù) with Bristol.31  Bristol filed an NDA for taxol on July 22, 1992, which the FDA
approved five months later.32  At that time, it was widely expected that generic pharmaceutical
companies would submit ANDAs for generic taxol in December 1997, at the conclusion of Bristol‚Äôs
five-year new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity awarded by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.33

A-36
In August 1992, Bristol filed a patent application, which resulted in Patent Nos. 5,641,803 (the
‚Äò803 patent) and 5,670,537 (the ‚Äò537 patent).  Those patents claim an FDA-approved method of
administering a specified amount of taxol to a patient over the course of three hours.  Bristol listed both
patents in the Orange Book and sued the generic ANDA applicants, who had filed paragraph IV
certifications.  The patent infringement suit against IVAX Corp., the first paragraph IV filer, triggered a
30-month stay on FDA approval that lasted until June 2, 2000.  In March 2000, the district court hearing
the infringement suit entered summary judgment that both patents were invalid in light of references
reporting on government-sponsored clinical trials of taxol.34  The Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit affirmed that decision as to the majority of asserted claims in April 2001.35
Although the ‚Äò803 and ‚Äò537 patents no longer blocked generic competition at the time the 30-
month stay expired in June 2000, the FDA had not yet approved any generic version of taxol for
marketing.  For that reason, when American Biosciences, Inc. (ABI) obtained Patent No. 6,096,331 (the
‚Äò331 patent) on August, 1, 2000, and Bristol listed it in the Orange Book as explained below, the patent
had the potential to create a second 30-month stay on generic entry.  Due to a series of tangled legal
maneuvers, this never came to pass, however, and the ‚Äò331 patent delayed FDA approval of a generic
product for only a few weeks.
The story of the ‚Äò331 patent is complex.  It claims priority back to an original application filed in
1993, seven years before its issuance.  The majority of the claims in the patent cover taxol ‚Äúsubstantially
free of cremophor,‚Äù the solvent used for dissolving and administering the FDA-approved version of
taxol.  Hence, these claims do not cover the approved version of taxol and cannot support listing. 
However, a small number of broad claims recite a ‚Äúvessel‚Äù containing a specified amount of a taxol
ranging from 33 mg to 3000 mg.  These claims arguably cover, for instance, a bag for intravenous
administration of taxol as approved by the FDA, but a district court has also invalidated the claims based
on this interpretation.36
At the time the ‚Äò331 patent issued, ABI approached Bristol, asking that it list the ‚Äò331 patent in
the Orange Book.  Bristol initially refused, so ABI sought and obtained a temporary restraining order on
August 11, 2000 from the district court for the Central District of California requiring Bristol to list the
patent.37  Bristol later agreed to list the patent, and the parties requested that the court enter their
settlement agreement, but on September 7, 2000, the district court refused, and instead dismissed the
case on the grounds that ABI had no private right of action seeking listing of a patent in the Orange
Book.  Thus, the district court dissolved the TRO and ordered Bristol to delist the patent by September

14.38  Also on September 7, ABI brought a patent infringement suit against IVAX and asserted to the
FDA that the suit barred approval of IVAX‚Äôs ANDA for 30 months.39
On September 11, 2000, Bristol, without referring to the earlier listing, informed the FDA that it
wished to list the ‚Äò331 patent.  Bristol again communicated with the FDA on September 14, this time
stating that it was de-listing the ‚Äò331 patent ‚Äúto the extent that listing was compelled by the TRO,‚Äù but
that it did not mean to ‚Äúaffect the continued and continuous listing of the patent.‚Äù40  The FDA considered
Bristol‚Äôs August 11 listing ineffective and its September 11 listing to be late, because it occurred more
than 30 days after the patent issued.41  For that reason, the FDA did not require the ANDA applicants to
submit paragraph IV certifications regarding the ‚Äò331 patent or view ABI‚Äôs infringement suit as creating
a 30-month stay.  On September 15, the FDA granted final approval to IVAX‚Äôs generic taxol.42  ABI
sought review of this decision in the D.C. district court, which sided with the FDA on October 3, 2000.43 
IVAX began marketing about three weeks later and remains on the market.  At least two other generic
manufacturers have subsequently entered.
In November 2001, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court‚Äôs affirmance of
FDA‚Äôs decision to consider Bristol‚Äôs September 11 listing untimely and to grant final approval to IVAX. 
Moreover, the Court of Appeals ordered the FDA to vacate its approval of IVAX‚Äôs ANDA, effective
January 24, 2002.44  This never occurred, however, because Bristol decided against relisting the ‚Äò331
patent45 following the January 11, 2002 decision by the district court holding that the asserted patents

Appendix H:
Orange Book Patent Analysis
This appendix describes and analyzes three categories of patents that raise Orange Book
listability questions and provides examples of patents falling into those categories.  The appendix also
suggests ways in which the listability questions might be addressed.  The FTC Staff identified the patent
categories and examples by reviewing all patents listed for drug products for which the responding
generic companies indicated that they had challenged a listing in some way.   The cited examples are not
exhaustive.  They only illustrate a category.  Chapter 4 of this report describes the statutory and
regulatory scheme governing Orange Book listings and underlying this analysis.
Patents Not Claiming the Approved Drug Substance, Drug Formulation or Use
As explained in Chapter 4, the listing regulation requires that those patents listed in the Orange
Book claim the drug product that is the subject of the NDA, or an approved use of that product.  The
regulation allows the listing of drug substance patents, drug formulation patents, and method of use
patents.  One court has pointed out that the scope of the NDA, and not the brand-name company‚Äôs drug
as marketed, controls the listing analysis.49  Normally, the scope of the approved NDA will closely align
with the marketed drug, given that almost all changes to a drug‚Äôs formulation or labeling require
supplemental FDA approval.50  Therefore, in most cases, one can compare a patent with the FDA
approved, marketed drug to analyze whether the patent listing is appropriate.  In this analysis, the FTC
Staff compared the listed patent to the drug product as described in the Physician‚Äôs Desk Reference, 55th
ed. (2001).  It is possible, however, that resolution of a listing dispute might depend on an interpretation
of the scope of approval granted through the NDA, and a mechanism for addressing this issue could be
valuable.
Some patents listed in the Orange Book claim a formulation that differs from the formulation
approved through the NDA.  For instance, the FTC has alleged that Patent No. 6,162,463, listed for
Tiazac (diltiazem) claims a formulation comprising slow release beads and free diltiazem but that the
Tiazac formulation approved through the NDA contains only slow release beads.51  Other listed patents
claim only unapproved uses of the drug.  For example, Patent No. 5,084,479, listed for Neurontin
(gabapentin), claims the use of gabapentin to treat neurodegenerative diseases.  The FDA has approved
gabapentin only for treating epilepsy, which is not a neurodegenerative disease.  Other patents falling
into this category are those that claim a method of using a drug substance other than the approved drug
substance, such as Patent No. 4,621,077, listed for Fosamax (alendronate sodium), which claims a
method of using the acid form of alendronate.  Only the sodium form of alendronate is sold.
52   Two examples are Prilosec (omeprazole, Patent No. 4,636,499) and BuSpar (buspirone Patent No. 6,150,365). 
The generic applicants in the omeprazole litigation moved for summary judgment that they did not contribute to or induce
infringement of the ‚Äò499 patent.  The district court granted that motion based, in part, on the argument of the generic applicants
that the patent could not cover a patient‚Äôs ingesting and metabolizing omeprazole because that activity was prior art to the patent.

Squibb, 10 F.3d 1418, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (infringement may occur if the administered product is converted in vivo in to the
claimed product);  35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(b), (c) (one who induces or contributes to infringement of a patent is liable as an infringer).

Brand-name companies also have listed patents that claim a drug substance differing from the
approved drug substance in some way.  These patents generally fall into three subcategories: metabolites,
polymorphs, and intermediates.  Each subcategory raises its own specific issues, as elaborated below.
(i) Metabolite Patents
Of the drug products for which the FTC Staff examined listed patents, there are at least two
instances where brand-name companies have listed and sued generic companies for infringement of
metabolite patents.52  A metabolite is the chemical compound into which a patient‚Äôs body metabolizes or
converts the active ingredient of a drug product.  Often the metabolite, rather than the active ingredient
itself, produces the drug‚Äôs therapeutic effect in the body.  Only patients, and not the generic applicant,
can directly infringe a metabolite patent; they do so by ingesting the approved drug product and then
metabolizing it into the claimed compound.  Typically, the patentee charges that the generic applicant
will induce or contribute to the infringement of the metabolite patent by selling its drug to patients who
then metabolize it.53 
One district court explicitly has held that a brand-name company may not list a metabolite patent
in the Orange Book, because the metabolite patent does not ‚Äúclaim the drug,‚Äù as required by the listing
statute.54  The court looked to the precedent, Hoechst-Roussel Pharms., Inc. v. Lehman,55 which
interpreted the term ‚Äúclaims‚Äù in the Patent Term Restoration portion of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
at 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 156(a) and concluded that a metabolite patent does not ‚Äúclaim‚Äù the approved drug
product.  
Whether a brand-name company appropriately may list patents claiming metabolites or the use of
metabolites in the Orange Book could be clarified through FDA regulation or guidance.
(ii) Polymorph Patents
Another category of patents that raises listing questions includes those patents claiming a
chemical compound that differs by water-of-hydration or that forms a crystalline structure different from
the active ingredient approved by FDA through the NDA.  For instance, the FDA has approved the
anhydrate form of gabapentin (having no water) but the Orange Book contains a patent claiming the
56   See FDA, Preface to Twenty First Edition of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation,
available at <http://www.fda.gov/cder/orange/adp.htm>.
57   One district court addressed the issue and agreed.  In Zenith Laboratories, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 1996 WL
33344963 (D.N.J. 1996), the court denied Zenith‚Äôs request that the court order Abbott, the holder of an approved NDA on
terazosin dihydrate (Hytrin), to de-list four patents claiming anhydrous terazosin.  Contrary to FDA regulations stating that the
agency does not review the propriety of a listing, the court stated, ‚Äúthe FDA approved Abbott‚Äôs [anhydrate] patents for listing. 
Such approval demonstrates that the FDA believed that those patents are covered by an approved drug product.‚Äù Id. at *9.  Zenith
appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the parties settled following oral argument and before
the court issued an opinion, with Abbott paying Zenith, who agreed to stay off the market. In re Terazosin Antitrust Litigation,
164 F. Supp.2d 1340, 1346 (S.D. Fla. 2000). 
A-41
monohydrate form of gabapentin (having one water molecule in its crystalline structure for each
gabapentin molecule).  Compounds differing in this way, or by the way in which the individual
molecules arrange in a crystalline structure, are called polymorphs.  Some drugs having patents listed
which claim a form of the active ingredient differing by water of hydration from the approved form
include Hytrin (terazosin hydrochloride), Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) and Neurontin (gabapentin). 
The FDA typically grants approval through an NDA to a brand-name company to sell only one
polymorph of an active ingredient.  The company may not sell other versions of the active ingredient
without FDA approval.  Thus, one view is that these different polymorphs of the approved active
ingredient are not part of the approved drug product, and patents claiming the different polymorphs do
not claim the approved drug product, thus making the listing of such patents questionable. 
An alternative view recognizes that under certain circumstances, the FDA will treat a compound
differing by water-of-hydration or crystalline structure from an approved active ingredient as the same
active ingredient.  The FDA will allow the active ingredient of a generic product to differ in these ways
if the generic applicant demonstrates that its product is bioequivalent to the brand-name company‚Äôs
product.56  For this reason, some have argued that patents claiming compounds that differ by water-of-
hydration or crystalline structure from the approved active ingredient claim the ‚Äúsame‚Äù active ingredient
and therefore should be listable.57
A response to this argument is based on the fact that often the form of the active ingredient used
in the approved drug product is prior art to the later-issued polymorph patent.  This is the case for
Hytrin, Paxil, and Neurontin.  That means that the patentee argued, and the Patent Office agreed, that the
different polymorph was sufficiently distinct from the FDA-approved polymorph to be patentable.  This
fact highlights the difficulty in treating the two compounds as the ‚Äúsame‚Äù for purposes of the patent
analysis required by Orange Book listings.  Listable patents are those that ‚Äúclaim‚Äù the approved drug
product (a concept based on patent principles), and not every patent that a bioequivalent product might
infringe.  The listing analysis is rooted in patent concepts, and the ability of two polymorphs to form
bioequivalent products is not decisive to that analysis.  If the ability of two polymorphs to form
bioequivalent products made them the ‚Äúsame‚Äù for patent purposes (as opposed to FDA purposes), the
brand-name company could never obtain the later polymorph patent in the first place because the earlier,
approved polymorph would invalidate it.
58   The brand-name company admitted that Aredia was sold as the anhydrous (lacking water) form of pamidronate, not
the pentahydrate form , which contains five water molecules for every pamidronate molecule.  Ben Venue Labs., Inc. v. Novartis
Pharm. Corp., 10 F. Supp. 2d 446, 454 (D. N.J. 1998) (the court did not address whether the generic applicant had a private right
of action to challenge the listing).

60   Id. at 455-58; see 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b) (‚ÄúFor patents that claim a drug substance or drug product, the applicant

or that claim a drug substance that is a component of such a product.‚Äù).
61   Id. at 456 (quoting 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 210.3(b)(3)).
A-42
Whether a brand-name company may appropriately list polymorph patents, or those claiming a
use or formulation containing a polymorph, could be clarified through FDA regulation or guidance.  This
is the subject of the FTC Staff‚Äôs Citizen Petition.
(iii) Drug Intermediate Patents
The ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù patents listed in the Orange Book present a category that may not literally
claim the approved drug product.  An intermediate patent claims a chemical compound that is used
during the production of an active ingredient, but is not present in the final, marketed form of the drug
product.  The claimed compound is an ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù on the pathway to the approved drug. 
In the patent litigation concerning Aredia (pamidronte disodium), the district court held that a
brand-name company may list intermediate patents in the Orange Book.  The generic applicant
challenged the listing of a patent claiming a compound used in the manufacture of its product, which the
brand-name company admitted was not present in Aredia.58  The district court held that the brand-name
company could maintain the listing, however, on the basis that the claimed compound was a
‚Äúcomponent‚Äù of Aredia because it was used in the manufacture of that drug product.59  For support, the
court looked to the FDA‚Äôs listing regulations that allow listing of a patent claiming a ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù of an
approved drug product,60 and the FDA‚Äôs regulations on good manufacturing practices defining
‚Äúcomponent‚Äù to mean ‚Äúany ingredient for use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that
may not appear in such a drug product.‚Äù61  The court did not address whether a patent claiming an
intermediate compound claims the approved drug product.
Whether a brand-name company may appropriately list intermediate patents could be clarified
through FDA regulation or guidance.
Product-by-Process Patents
A simple example of the claims of a chemical product-by-process patent, and a comparison with
product and process patents, is necessary to understanding the listing issues surrounding these patents. 
A product patent claim would recite ‚Äúsuch and such substance.‚Äù  A related process patent claim would
recite ‚Äúa process for making such and such substance by performing steps (a) and (b).‚Äù  A corresponding
62   21 C.F.R. ¬ß 314.53(b).  Examples of ‚Äúproduct-by-process‚Äù patents are the three patents listed for Paxil (paroxetine
hydrochloride).  
63   Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 970 F.2d 834, 844 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
64   A process claim covers performance of the process steps, but it also provides patent coverage to products made
according to the recited process.  35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(g) (‚Äú Whoever without authority imports into the United States or offers to
sell, sells, or uses within the United States a product which is made by a patented process in the United States shall be liable  as
an infringer . . . .‚Äù ).
65   A counter-argument is that, based on a statement in the Federal Circuit opinion, Scripps Clinic & Research
Foundation v. Genentech, Inc., the process limitations of these patent claims must be ignored, effectively making them listable
product claims.  In that case the court stated ‚Äúthe correct reading of product-by-process claims is that they are not limited to a
product prepared by the process set forth in the claims.‚Äù  927 F.2d 1565, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1991).  A later case, Atlantic
Thermoplastics, held that process limitations must be considered.  970 F.2d 834, 844 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  However, the two cases
can be reconciled in this context.  If the patentee depended on the novelty of the process limitations in obtaining these patents, it
is then estopped from ignoring those limitations.  Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 974 F.2d 1279, 1280  (J. Rich,
dissent from denial of reh‚Äôg en banc) (patentee admitted that product-by-process claim was limited to the process and claim must
be interpreted accordingly); Id. at 1299 (J. Lourie, same).  When the product is old, but the process is new, as is generally the
case with patents related to small-molecule pharmaceutical compounds, the claim is a process claim, not a true product-by-
process claim of the type discussed in Scripps. ‚ÄúThe Scripps class of product-by-process claims is quite different from claims
[which are] allowed when the process is found patentable.‚Äù  Id. at 1282 (J. Newman, same).  Under this analysis, an
interpretation of the listed product-by-process patents as process patents is completely consistent with the Scripps case. 
Moreover, any argument that ignores the process limitations in an attempt to support the Orange Book listing on the grounds that
these are product patents would necessarily invalidate the patents, thereby suggesting that a claim of patent infringement could
not ‚Äúreasonably be asserted‚Äù under this claim interpretation, as required for listing under 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(b)(1).
A-43
product-by-process patent claim would simply rearrange words of the process claim to recite ‚Äúsuch and
such substance made by the process of performing steps (a) and (b).‚Äù 
 Two arguments support the position that product-by-process claims may not be listed.  First,
although the FDA‚Äôs listing regulation does not address product-by-process patents, it specifically defines
three categories of listable patents:  drug substance (ingredient) patents, drug product (formulation and
composition) patents, and method of use patents.  Product-by-process patents do not comprise a category
of listable patents under the FDA‚Äôs listing regulation.  Second, the listing regulation and Hatch-
Waxman‚Äôs legislative history prohibit the listing of process patents,62 and product-by-process claims are
arguably similar to process patents than are product patents.  As seen above, the wording of the product-
by-process claim more closely resembles that of the process claim, not the product claim.  Moreover, the
scope of patent coverage afforded by a product-by-process patent for small-molecule pharmaceuticals
typically is identical to that afforded by the corresponding process patent.
An examination of two listed product-by-process patents illustrates this latter point. Patent Nos.
6,063,927 (the ‚Äò927 patent) and 6,172,233 (‚Äò233) both claim paroxetine hydrochloride made according to
specified processes.   In each case, the patent itself acknowledges that paroxetine hydrochloride was well
known at the time the brand-name company applied for the patents.  The brand-name company
represented to the Patent Office in the patent document that the recited process was new and made the
claims patentable.  Therefore, if valid, these patents cover only those products (paroxetine
hydrochloride) made according to the specified process,63 just as process patents cover products made
according to the specified process.64  In contrast,  product patents, such as listable drug substance and
formulation patents, cover a product regardless of the process by which it is made.65  Thus, product-by-

The Patent Office allows a terminal disclaimer to cure an obviousness-type double patenting rejection only when the same entity
owns both patents.
67   Research Corp. Techs. v. Gensia Labs., Inc., 10 Fed. Appx. 856 (Fed. Cir. 2001)(unpublished).
68   A continuation patent is one filed during the pendency of another, earlier patent application, which contains the
same disclosure as the earlier application.  The continuation refers back to the earlier application and receives the benefit of its
earlier filing date for purposes of identifying prior art and determining patentability.  A continuation application generally claims
the same invention claimed in the earlier application, although there may be some variation in the scope of the subject matter
claimed.  The term "parent" refers to the immediately preceding application upon which a continuing application claims priority.

A-44
process patents in which only the novelty of the process supports patentability arguably are characterized
more accurately as process patents.  
Whether a brand-name company may appropriately list such patents could be clarified through
FDA regulation or guidance.
Double Patenting 
When a patent applicant obtains a second patent claiming subject matter that is the same as or
obvious in light of the claims of an earlier issued patent, it is called ‚Äúdouble-patenting.‚Äù  The patent
statute and the judicially-created doctrine of ‚Äúobviousness-type double patenting‚Äù renders such patents
invalid.  The doctrine of double patenting prevents the patentee from extending the patent right beyond
the statutorily granted time limit.66  The Platinol example, as described in Appendix G, provides an
example of a 30-month stay created by a patent invalid for double-patenting.  The brand-name company
obtained a 30-month stay by obtaining, listing and suing on Patent No. 5,562,925.  The Federal Circuit
eventually invalidated that patent for double patenting -- 45 months after the generic applicant
challenged the validity of the patent.67  The ‚Äò925 patent effectively generated an additional 30 months of
exclusivity even though it claimed nothing new.
In some circumstances a patentee may obtain a second patent that is obvious in view of its own
earlier patent.  The Patent Office typically allows a patent applicant to obtain such a patent only if the
applicant files a ‚Äúterminal disclaimer‚Äù for the later patent, disclaiming the term of the later patent that
extends beyond the term of original patent, so that both patents expire on the same day.  In those cases in
which the brand-name company files a terminal disclaimer for the later patent, the later patent does not
provide rights beyond those of the earlier patent because both expire on the same day.  This is the
rationale behind the Patent Office‚Äôs allowing the later patent.  The later patent does provide additional
protection from generic competition, however, if it generates a second, later-expiring 30-month stay.  
Fosamax provides an example of how double-patenting with a terminal disclaimer may result in
multiple 30-month stays.  The brand-name company listed and initially sued on the earlier patent, No.
5,849,726 (the ‚Äò726 patent), which claims ‚Äúa method for treating and/or preventing bone loss‚Äù using the
anhydrate form of alendronate sodium.  The later patent,  No. 6,008,207 (the ‚Äò207 patent), was a
continuation of the ‚Äò726 patent.68  It claims ‚Äúa method for treating bone resorption‚Äù and ‚Äúa method for
69   Specifically, the patents state, ‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòinhibition of bone resorption‚Äô as used herein, refers to treatment and
prevention of bone loss . . . .‚Äù  U.S. Patent No. 6,008,207, col. 2, lines 28-29.  
70   Publicly available information does not provide a reason for the stipulated dismissal.
A-45
inhibiting bone resorption‚Äù using the anhydrate form.  As the patents explain, however, ‚Äúa method for
treating and/or preventing bone loss‚Äù is the same thing as ‚Äúa method for treating and/or inhibiting bone
resorption.‚Äù69  The brand-name company filed a terminal disclaimer on the ‚Äò207 patent, presumably to
overcome or avoid a rejection based on double patenting.  The brand-name company sued for
infringement of the ‚Äò207 patent based on a paragraph IV certification approximately four months after
suing based on the ‚Äò726 patent.  
In theory, the later-issued ‚Äò207 patent provides no additional patent protection beyond the ‚Äò726
patent because both expire on the same day.  However, the ‚Äò207 patent generated a second, later-expiring
30-month stay because it issued later, thus triggering a later paragraph IV certification and a later suit. 
Consequently, the later-issued ‚Äò207 patent did provide an additional exclusionary right beyond the ‚Äò726
patent that potentially had the ability to delay generic entry by an additional four months.  That delay
never materialized because the court dismissed the suits on both patents by stipulation of the parties
before the first 30-month stay expired, thereby extinguishing the 30-month stays generated by both the
‚Äò207 and the ‚Äò726 patents.70  
Whether a brand-name company may appropriately list additional patents claiming subject matter
that is the same as or obvious in light of the claims of an earlier-issued patent for the same drug product
could be clarified through FDA regulation or guidance.
