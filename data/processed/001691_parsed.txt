The myths
Nanomyth 1: 
There is a “nanotech bubble”
Nanomyth 2: 
No one’s making money from nanotech
Nanomyth 3: 
Nanotech companies will be valued 
like IT and software companies
Nanomyth 4: 
There is a nanotechnology market

Received wisdom
Nanotech Bubble
“Run for the hills”
or get dot.bombed
No $ in Nano
“Run for the hills”
or get “dark 
fibered”

Received wisdom
Nanotech valued like 
IT
I’m rich, I’m rich, 
I’m comfortably 
well off!!
There’s a nanotech 
market
It says “nano”: 
Buy! Buy!, no, 
Sell!  Sell!!

Nanomyth 2: No $ in Nano
• Established applications already in the billions 
that don't represent any new innovation
– nano-TiO2 ($ market)
– carbon black ($5 billion market)
– 90nm semiconductors ($ market)
• Any market estimate is useless unless its 
established and emerging components are 
teased apart.
Micro/Nano Conference
Portland OR
July 2004
The upshot
• While these established applications will 
continue to dominate overall market size 
for the next ten years, emerging 
applications will dominate growth with a 
triple-digit CAGR and account for the 
majority of gross profits generated by 
nanotechnology.

Nanomyth 3: Nanotech cos will be 
valued like IT & software cos
• IT / software cos: typically 10x-100x valuations
• NOT NANO
Commodity materials purchased on price and 
availability (i.e. most nanomaterials -- CNTs, 
dendrimers, etc.), once performance and reliability 
characteristics are established for >1 supplier, 
Near-term nanomarkets will resemble commodity 
markets for pork bellies: 1x-3x valuations

Nanomyth 4: There is a nanotech 
market
•
Media and market analysts tend to refer 
to nanotechnology as a single, cohesive 
market and establish its “size” by
1. Adding up “shipments” (CNTs in a box)
or
2. Add up end product sales (the whole car)
Neither produces market numbers that can 
be reconciled to GDP or to SIC codes, and 
therefore are of little strategic value
Micro/Nano Conference

Good numbers?
• Cientifica: counted up the shipments of all 44 
global nanotube suppliers
• Business Communications Company: 150 
interviews to count up nanomaterials shipments 
(most of which, BTW, are not new but produced 
using established top-down techniques)
• Freedonia: 180-some individual nanomaterials
suppliers

the 3 truths
•
Nanotruth 1:  Nanotechnologies represent a new value chain 
framework of nanomaterials, nanoenablers, and nano-enabled 
products – each with its own characteristics and market 
dynamics: only the nano-enabled products category captures a 
GDP-style measure
•
Nanotruth 2: There is an analytical axis of established versus 
emerging (disruptive) applications – both are valid measures, but 
must be separated and market value apportioned appropriately
•
Nanotruth 3: There is an emerging “nanotechnology economy”--
as nanotech penetrates key markets there will be a ripple effect
across industrial sectors – requires extrapolation of total 
economic impact of nanotechnology based on good market 
forecast numbers
Micro/Nano Conference

July 2004
The big questions, part 1
• How big is the market for nanomaterials versus 
nanoenablers versus nano-enabled products? How do 
these markets interrelate – which drives which and over 
what time period? (And where does your nano-
breakthrough fit in?)
• What portion of market value is attributable to 
established products and methods of production versus 
emerging, disruptive alternatives? How will this change 
over time?
• Where are the profits – which segments have high, 
defensible gross margins and which are ruled by ruthless 
commodity economics?
Micro/Nano Conference
Portland OR
July 2004
The big questions, part 2
• How does the market size break down by 
industry grouping (manufacturing versus 
electronics versus life sciences) and by 
geography (US, Europe, Asia, ROW)?
• Are these numbers big or small relative to the 
big picture of spending and output in affected 
industries?
• What will be the broader economic impact of 
these numbers (i.e. total value created)?
