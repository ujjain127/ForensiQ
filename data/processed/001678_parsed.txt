UNDER SECRETARY FOR HEALTH’S INFORMATION LETTER 
 
MICROBIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL CLEANROOMS 
 
1.   This VHA Information Letter provides recommendations for microbiological assessment of 
pharmacy cleanrooms and the testing of biocabinet or isolator interiors.   
 
 
a.  United States Pharmacopeia (USP), Chapter 797, “Pharmaceutical Compounding, Sterile 
Preparations,” specifies the monitoring of microbiological concentrations on surfaces and air for 
sterile pharmaceutical compounding.   
 
 
b.  USP, Chapter 1116, “Microbiological Evaluation of Cleanrooms and Other Controlled 
Environments,” provides additional guidance.   
 
 
c.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides regulatory requirements and 
recommendations for the drug manufacturing industry.   
 
 
d.  The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) specifies 
practices for accurate monitoring of indoor airborne microbial concentrations.   
 
 
e.  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14644 requires acceptable 
airborne particulate concentrations and assessment for pharmaceutical cleanrooms. 
 
2.  USP 797 specifies a written plan and schedule for microbiological monitoring procedures in 
pharmaceutical cleanrooms.  Monitoring locations are selected to test the areas most prone to 
contamination during compounding.  Typically, this would include area sampling in the 
proximity of Class II biocabinets or barrier isolators (ISO Class 5 containment).  The plan needs 
to specify sampling for the controlled environments of the pharmacy, including the interior of 
biocabinets and barrier isolators, compounding rooms (ISO Class 7 buffer areas), and anterooms 
(ISO Class 8 support areas) located outside the buffer area.  Each sampling site (air, swab, or 
contact) needs to have predetermined alert and action levels as part of the written plan.  Any 
sample result exceeding the action level requires immediate corrective action which may include 
full-scale cleaning, ventilation, or High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter assessment and 
suspension of drug compounding until retesting verifies compliance.

3.  GUIDANCE 
 
 
a.  Collection of Microbiological Samples in Cleanrooms.  Microbiological sampling 
should be incorporated into the cleanroom commissioning process to verify engineering controls 
and provide baseline data prior to compounding  activities.  Air sampling should be conducted 
monthly for low-medium risk compounding and weekly for high-risk compounding.  Cleanroom 
microflora will originate from staff, supplies and product contamination, air backwash through 
entrances and room filter leakage.  Air samples should be collected following any required 
cleanroom air purge time that has been established by the pharmacy unit.  The air purge time 
ensures the necessary number of air changes have been completed to reduce airborne 
contaminants prior to starting compounding activities.  Electric pump air sampling (active air 
sampling) may be conducted using slit, sieve or centrifugal impact samplers.  Samples are 
collected on nutrient media and incubated to promote microbial growth.  The plate colonies are 
counted and reported as the number of colony forming units per cubic meter of air (cfu/M3).  The 
use of settling plates (open plates exposed for >1 hour) is suggested by USP 797.  Settling plates 
have a higher error rate due to the uncontrolled sampling method and susceptibility to indoor air 
currents.  USP recommends that settling plates only be used during sampling with electric pump 
samplers to allow for the comparison of data.  The ACGIH documents high variability in 
airborne microbiological assessment data.  Data variability is affected by media selection and 
storage, plate handling (temperature extremes during shipping to culture labs), incubation 
temperature and species viability.  Species competition on the plate also affects total plate count.   
 
 
b.  Culture Plate Media and Incubation.  USP recommends plate media and incubations 
times for general culture.  Sampling should be conducted using non-selective malt extract agar or 
trypticase soy agar (TSA).  Malt extract can be used for fungi culture with incubation at 20-25°C 
for up to 7 days.  USP 797 recommends TSA media incubated at 30-35 °C for 48 hours (bacteria, 
yeast and mold).  USP 1116 recommends incubation temperatures of 22.5°C (± 2.5°C) or 32.5°C 
(±2.5 °C) for  48-72 hours.  More importantly, the plate media, incubation temperature and 
sample time should be consistent to ensure appropriate comparison of data.  The decision to 
change culture media should be phased-in gradually and include side-by-side plate sampling for 
data comparison.  Media may also be selected to assess specific microbiological species (i.e., 
gram-negative or positive bacteria).    
 
 
c.  Airborne Microbiological Concentrations.  Current USP 797 does not recommend 
specific airborne microbiological concentration limits for cleanrooms.   
 
 
(1)  The standard specifies the collection of microbial data and recommends corrective action 
when colony counts exceed the baseline by 50 percent (medium to high-risk compounding) and 
100 percent (low-risk compounding).  
 
 
(2)  Alternatively, Hussong and Madsen provide an analysis of baseline deviation specific to 
cleanroom operations.  The data trend is used to establish upper and lower confidence limits for 
cleanroom colony counts (see subpar. 4c).  The FDA provides comparison between ISO class 7 
and 8 environments and microbiological action levels using active air sampling and settling 
plates (see Table 1 and subpar. 4d).

(3)   Kastango recommends less than (<) 2.5 colony forming units (cfu) per cubic foot (ft3) 
airborne bioburden for cleanrooms and anterooms and <0.1 cfu/ft3  for ISO Class 5 biocabinets 
and isolators (see subpar. 4f).

d.  Sampling Strategy for Cleanrooms.  Sampling sites need to be selected in high-traffic 
areas where the potential exists for product contamination and to verify levels at compounding 
work areas.   
 
 
(1)  Air samples need to be collected within 12 inches of all Class 5 containment work zones 
(12 inches outside the cabinet face), all cleanroom entrances, and the anteroom.  NOTE:  
Specific guidance on sampling locations is provided in Chapter 18, ASHP, Compounding Sterile 
Preparations (see subpar. 4f).  A minimum of one media plate or 20 percent of the total plates 
needs to be incubated as a control (non-exposed blank) for each assessment to check media 
contamination.   
 
 
(2)  Table 2 provides the recommended air sample volumes for estimated airborne 
microbiological concentrations.  An air sample volume of 990 liters of air would meet the 
ACGIH recommended lower detection level(LDL=10 cfu/plate) and upper detection limits 
(UDL=1 cfu/ square centimeter (cm2) of plate) for a ISO Class 7 room with 1-10 cfu/M3.

e.  Identification of Microbiological Species.  Most laboratory services will provide Genus 
identification with total plate colony count.  In certain applications it may be beneficial to 
determine whether the bacteria is gram positive or negative, or a full identification to species 
level of the organism may be required.  Species identification may be appropriate during 
cleanroom commissioning for comparison to an action level event.  Identification to species can 
assist in determining the source of contamination and corrective actions.  Additionally, air 
sampling can be conducted in adjacent hallways or outdoor air to assess anterooms, or HEPA 
filter bypass.   
 
 
f.  ISO Class 5 Microbiological Containment Testing.  The interior of ISO Class 5 
(biocabinets and isolators) need to be monitored for microbiological air quality at a minimum of 
once a month, or weekly for high-risk compounding.  Sampling may be conducted using media 
filled plates or commercial media fills.  At least two plate samples need to be collected at 
opposite ends of the cabinet, 6 inches from the interior wall.  Settling plates or active air 
sampling can be used for the assessment.  Settling plates should be exposed for the entire 
compounding procedure (1-3 hours) and are an acceptable alternative due to the laminar 
downflow within the cabinet.   
 
 
(1)  It is also recommended that finger touch plates be conducted monthly.  This procedure 
requires the technician to contact a media plate during compounding with the gloved fingertips.   
 
 
(2)  Swabbing of interior cabinet surfaces also need to be conducted using pre-filled media 
tubes with a swab insert or a commercial media fill (Rodac plates).   
 
 
(3)  Media fills need to contain a neutralizing agent (i.e., polysorbate 80) to inactivate 
residual cleaning and disinfection solutions.   
 
 
(4)  Following incubation, colonies need to be counted and reported as cfus.  Samples from 
ISO Class 5 environments normally yield no microbiological colonies.
