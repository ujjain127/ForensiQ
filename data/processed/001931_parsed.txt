From the Administrator
Developed as an alternative to the
traditional juvenile court system for
younger and less serious offenders,
teen courts operate on the premise
that the judgment of a juvenile
offender’s peers may have a greater
impact than the decisions of adult au-
thority figures.
The teen court concept has gained
popularity in recent years as juvenile
courts have had to deal with in-
creased numbers of serious, violent,
and chronic juvenile offenders. Its ac-
ceptance has been fueled, in part, by
positive anecdotal reports from those
involved with this peer-centered ap-
proach. This Bulletin examines sev-
eral teen court evaluations, but cau-
tions that we lack the empirical data
needed to fully evaluate the effective-
ness of this intervention.
In keeping with its commitment to
identifying “what works,” OJJDP is
funding the Evaluation of Teen Courts
Project. This Bulletin includes a pro-
file of teen court characteristics and
implementation challenges, derived
from a national survey of teen courts
conducted in the project’s first phase.
Phase two will consist of a multisite
evaluation.
Until the findings of that evaluation
are available next year, I hope that
communities considering the merits
of teen courts will find this Bulletin to
be a useful interim guide.

Teen Courts:
A Focus on Research
Jeffrey A. Butts and Janeen Buck
Growing from a handful of programs in
the 1960’s, the number of teen courts (or
youth courts) now operating in the United
States has been estimated to be as high as
675. Communities across the Nation con-
tinue to demand better information and
assistance with which to start or enhance
their own teen courts. This Bulletin helps
to address that demand by providing in-
formation about the characteristics of es-
tablished teen courts and the operational
and managerial challenges they face. It
also summarizes the evaluation literature
on teen courts.
Background
Teen courts are spreading rapidly across
the United States. Many people view them
as a cost-effective alternative to traditional
juvenile court for some young offenders.
Until recently, relatively little information
has been available about how teen courts
operate or how they affect youthful offend-
ers. This Bulletin presents the results of a
national survey of teen courts. The findings
suggest that most teen courts are relatively
small and were established very recently.
The findings also suggest that the most
established teen court programs (i.e., pro-
grams reporting longevity in operations
and/or little financial uncertainty) may be
those that are housed within or closely
affiliated with the traditional juvenile
justice system.
The survey indicates that teen courts
enjoy broad community support. Their
popularity appears to stem from favor-
able media coverage and the high levels
of satisfaction reported by parents, teach-
ers, and youth involved in teen court pro-
grams, rather than from evaluation re-
search showing that teen courts have
beneficial effects on offenders. Little re-
search has been conducted on outcomes
for teen court defendants, although some
studies offer encouraging results. Recent
studies have found that teen court par-
ticipation may be associated with low re-
cidivism rates, improved youth attitudes
toward authority, and increased knowl-
edge of the justice system among youth.
More research is required before claims
about teen court effectiveness can be
substantiated.
The Teen Court
Concept
Teen courts are generally used for
younger juveniles (ages 10 to 15), those
with no prior arrest records, and those
charged with less serious law violations
(e.g., shoplifting, vandalism, and disor-
derly conduct). Typically, young offend-
ers are offered teen court as a voluntary
alternative in lieu of more formal handling
by the traditional juvenile justice system
(see figure 1). Teen courts differ from

About the Evaluation of
Teen Courts Project
The Urban Institute’s Evaluation of
Teen Courts (ETC) Project is studying
four teen court programs: Anchorage
Youth Court in Anchorage, AK; Teen
Court of the Tempe Justice Court in
Maricopa County, AZ; Montgomery
County Teen Court in Rockville, MD;
and Independence Youth Court in Inde-
pendence, MO. These programs were
selected to maximize (1) the number of
courtroom models used by the
programs involved in the study, (2) the
mix of geographic locations, and (3)
the overall quality and length of service
of each program.
In each jurisdiction, youth whose
cases are handled in teen court are
being compared with those who en-
ter the traditional juvenile justice
system. The project is measuring the
extent to which teen court outcomes
differ from outcomes that might re-
sult if the cases of youth similar to
those diverted to teen court were
handled using normal procedures,
including the dismissal of charges
or informal adjustment. Outcomes
include postprogram recidivism and
changes in the teen’s perceptions of
the justice system (e.g., respect for
authority or trust in police).
The evaluation is investigating a va-
riety of teen court models. Some of
the courts in the study use adult
judges, while others use only youth
judges. Some are authorized to de-
termine a youth’s guilt, while others
only impose dispositions on juve-
niles who have previously admitted
their guilt. The purpose of the evalu-
ation is not to select one model over
another but to establish a baseline
of outcome information for the range
of teen court models now being
used throughout the country.
other juvenile justice programs because
young people rather than adults deter-
mine the disposition, given a broad array
of sentencing options made available by
adults overseeing the program. Teen
court defendants may go through an in-
take process, a preliminary review of
charges, a court hearing, and sentencing,
as in a regular juvenile court. In a teen
court, however, other young people are
responsible for much of the process.
Charges may be presented to the court by
a 15-year-old “prosecutor.” Defendants
may be represented by a 16-year-old “de-
fense attorney.” Other youth may serve as
jurors, court clerks, and bailiffs. In some
teen courts, a youth “judge” (or panel of
youth judges) may choose the best dispo-
sition or sanction for each case. In a few
teen courts, youth even determine
whether the facts in a case have been
proven by the prosecutor (similar to a
finding of guilt).
Adults are also involved in teen courts.
They often administer the programs, and
they are usually responsible for essential
functions such as budgeting, planning,
and personnel. In many programs, adults
supervise the courtroom activities, and
they often coordinate the community
service placements where youth work to
fulfill the terms of their dispositions. In
some programs, adults act as the judges
while teens serve as attorneys and jurors.
The key to all teen court programs, how-
ever, is the significant role youth play in
the deliberation of charges and the impo-
sition of sanctions on young offenders.
Proponents of teen court argue that the
process takes advantage of one of the
most powerful forces in the life of an
adolescent—the desire for peer approval
and the reaction to peer pressure. Accord-
ing to this argument, youth respond better
to prosocial peers than to adult authority
figures. Thus, teen courts are seen as a
potentially effective alternative to tradi-
tional juvenile courts staffed with paid
professionals such as lawyers, judges, and
probation officers. Teen court advocates
also point out that the benefits extend be-
yond defendants. Teen courts may benefit
the volunteer youth attorneys and judges,
who probably learn more about the legal
system than they ever could in a class-
room. The presence of a teen court may
also encourage the entire community to
take a more active role in responding to
juvenile crime. Teen courts offer at least
four potential benefits:
N Accountability. Teen courts may help
to ensure that young offenders are
held accountable for their illegal be-
havior, even when their offenses are
relatively minor and would not likely
result in sanctions from the traditional
juvenile justice system.
N Timeliness. An effective teen court can
move young offenders from arrest to
sanctions within a matter of days
3
rather than the months that may pass
with traditional juvenile courts. This
rapid response may increase the posi-
tive impact of court sanctions, regard-
less of their severity.
N Cost savings. Teen courts usually de-
pend heavily on youth and adult vol-
unteers. If managed properly, they
may handle a substantial number of
offenders at relatively little cost to the
community. The average annual cost
for operating a teen court is $32,822
(National Youth Court Center, unpub-
lished data).
N Community cohesion. A well-structured
and expansive teen court program may
affect the entire community by increas-
ing public appreciation of the legal sys-
tem, enhancing community-court rela-
tionships, encouraging greater respect
for the law among youth, and promoting
volunteerism among both adults and
youth.
Researchers are beginning to report in-
stances in which these potential benefits
have been realized in some communities,
but evaluation research on teen courts is
still in the early stages. It is too soon to
tell whether the positive results reported
by some communities can be replicated
reliably in other communities. Regardless
of the limited evidence, however, teen
courts are increasingly in use across the
United States. This Bulletin describes the
variety of teen courts and summarizes
what researchers know about the effects
of teen court programs.
National Survey
As part of the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention’s (OJJDP’s) Evalua-
tion of Teen Courts Project, The Urban Insti-
tute recently conducted a national survey
of teen courts and youth courts. With assis-
tance from the National Youth Court Center
(NYCC), which is housed at the American
Probation and Parole Association and sup-
ported by funds from OJJDP, project re-
searchers obtained addresses, telephone
numbers, and personal contacts for all U.S.
teen courts believed to exist as of the end
of 1998, and they mailed questionnaires to
nearly 500 programs. A handful of these
programs had gone out of business by the
time researchers tried to contact them.
Of the remaining programs, 335 (more than
70 percent) completed and returned the
survey. The responses documented the
range of teen court programs used by juris-
dictions across the country, the character-
istics of their clients, the sanctions they

Program Characteristics
Recent growth in the number of teen court
programs nationwide was reflected in the
brief tenure of the programs responding
to the national survey. Of all the programs
that responded, 13 percent had been in
operation less than 1 year and 42 percent
had been in operation for only 1 to 3 years.
More than two-thirds (67 percent) of all
teen courts had been in existence for less
than 5 years (see figure 2).
Many teen courts that responded to the
survey were closely affiliated with the tradi-
tional justice system (see figure 3). Courts,
law enforcement agencies, juvenile proba-
tion offices, or prosecutors’ offices oper-
ated slightly more than half (52 percent)
of the programs responding to the survey.
More than one-third (37 percent) of the pro-
grams were affiliated with the courts and
12 percent with law enforcement. Private
agencies operated one-quarter (25 percent)
of the teen court programs.
Most teen court and youth court programs
were relatively small (see figure 4). More
than half (59 percent) of the programs
responding to the survey handled 100 or
fewer cases annually. Just 13 percent of
the programs handled more than 300
cases per year.
Very few programs relied on private fund-
ing to meet their operational costs (see
figure 5). More than half (59 percent) of
the teen courts received no private fund-
ing; 16 percent of the programs received
up to one-fifth of their funding from pri-
vate sources, and 11 percent received be-
tween one-fifth and one-half from private
sources.
Client Characteristics
Teen courts usually handle relatively
young offenders with no prior arrests.
Survey respondents reported that, on
average, 24 percent of their cases in-
volved youth under age 14 and 66 per-
cent involved youth under age 16. More
than one-third (39 percent) of the teen
courts accepted only first-time offenders
and another 48 percent reported that
they “rarely” accepted youth with prior
arrest records. Nearly all programs (98
percent) reported that they “never” or
“rarely” accepted youth with prior felony
arrests. Most programs (91 percent) also
indicated that they “never” or “rarely”
4
accepted youth who previously had been
referred to a juvenile court.
To assess the nature of those cases typi-
cally handled in teen court, the survey
asked each program to review a list of
offenses and to indicate whether the pro-
gram received such cases “very often,”
“often,” “rarely,” or “never.” The offenses
most likely to be received “often” or “very
often” were theft (93 percent), minor as-
sault (66 percent), disorderly conduct
(62 percent), possession or use of alcohol
(60 percent), and vandalism (59 percent)
(see figure 6).
Sanctions
The principal goal of teen court is to hold
young offenders accountable for their be-
havior. In a system of graduated sanc-
tions, there is a consequence for every
offense. Every youth who has admitted
guilt or who is found guilty in teen court
receives some form of sanction. In many
communities, teen court sanctions do
more than punish the offender. Sanctions
encourage young offenders to repair at
least part of the damage they have caused
to the community or to specific victims.
Offenders are often ordered to pay resti-
tution or perform community service.
Some teen courts require offenders to
write formal apologies to their victims;
others require offenders to serve on a
subsequent teen court jury. Many courts
use other innovative dispositions, such as
requiring offenders to attend classes de-
signed to improve their decisionmaking
skills, enhance their awareness of victims,
and deter them from future theft.
Survey respondents were asked to assess
a list of typical sanctions and indicate how
frequently the program used each one (i.e.,
“very often,” “often,” “rarely,” or “never”).
Community service was the most com-
monly used sanction (see figure 7). Nearly
all (99 percent) of responding teen courts
reported using community service “often”
or “very often.” Other frequently used
sanctions included victim apology letters
(86 percent), written essays (79 percent),
teen court jury duty (74 percent), drug/
alcohol classes (60 percent), and restitu-
tion (34 percent).
Courtroom Models
NYCC divides the courtroom approaches
used by teen courts into four types (de-
scribed in table 1): adult judge, youth
judge, peer jury, and youth tribunal (Na-
tional Youth Court Center, 2000). Findings

courtroom models was added, the adult
judge model accounted for more than half
(60 percent) of all teen court cases.
The next most prevalent courtroom model
was the peer jury, which accounted for 22
percent of all teen court cases. More than
one in four (26 percent) teen court pro-
grams used this model for at least part of
their caseloads. The youth judge and tribu-
nal models were the least used, with each
accounting for just 7 percent of all cases.
The use of courtroom models varied some-
what according to the agency sponsoring
the program (see table 2). The adult judge
model was the most popular among teen
courts operated by local courts and proba-
tion agencies (58 percent) and those hosted
by schools, private agencies, and other not-
for-profit organizations (48 percent). There
was no dominant model, however, among
programs operated by law enforcement
agencies or prosecutors. In fact, more than
one-third (34 percent) of those programs
used mixed models (i.e., a combination of
two or more courtroom models).
Differences by courtroom model. The
characteristics of teen courts were nota-
bly different when the analysis controlled
for courtroom model (see table 3). For
example, programs using the youth judge
model were among the newest teen
court programs. Fewer than one-fifth
(19 percent) of these programs had been
in operation for 5 years or more, com-
pared with 31 percent of adult judge pro-
grams, 35 percent of programs using peer
juries, and 34 percent of programs using
the youth tribunal model. Most (58 per-
cent) youth judge programs had been in
operation for less than 2 years at the time
of the survey.
Youth judge programs were also the small-
est programs in terms of their annual case-
loads. Only 14 percent of programs using
the youth judge model reported more than
100 cases per year, compared with 40 per-
cent of programs using the adult judge
model and 38 percent of programs using
peer juries.
Programs using the peer jury model were
the least likely to depend on private fund-
ing. Nearly four-fifths (78 percent) of peer
jury programs received no private fund-
ing and only 13 percent received more
than one-third of their funding from pri-
vate sources. For most other courtroom
models, nearly half of the programs re-
sponding to the survey reported receiving
some private funding (i.e., 45 percent of
adult judge programs, 47 percent of youth
from the national survey suggested that
the adult judge model was the most popu-
lar. Nearly half (47 percent) of the respond-
ing courts used only the adult judge model.

adult judges in programs using a mix of

judge programs, and 48 percent of youth

Programs using the youth judge and youth
tribunal models were more likely to allow
juveniles to plead innocence or guilt and
to hold trials. About one-third (35 percent)
of programs using the youth judge model
and 44 percent of those using the youth
tribunal model held trials.
About 80 percent of teen court programs
responding to the survey had a paid, full-
time or part-time program director. Pro-
grams using the peer jury model were
least likely to have paid program direc-
tors (58 percent). Likewise, these pro-
grams were least likely to operate during
the summer months (53 percent).
Of the four major program models, youth
tribunal programs were the most likely
to accept referrals for youth with prior
arrest records. Only 28 percent of pro-
grams using the youth tribunal model
reported that they would “never” accept
youth with prior arrests, compared with
at least 40 percent for all other program
models. Just 39 percent of tribunal pro-
grams indicated that they would “never”
accept youth with prior juvenile court refer-
rals, compared with 50 percent or more
among the other types of teen court models.
Community Support
The success of an individual teen court may
depend on how well it is supported by vari-
ous segments of the community. Teen court
advocates have observed that it is essential
for teen courts to be accepted by the larger

tribunal with no prosecutor or defense attorney). The four courtroom models were first described by the National Youth Court Center, American Probation
and Parole Association.

justice system in their local area (National
Youth Court Center, 2000). To examine teen
court program directors’ perceptions of
community support for their programs, the
survey asked each program to consider sev-
eral prominent community groups and indi-
cate whether each was “very supportive,”
“moderately supportive,” “mildly support-
ive,” or “not at all supportive” (see figure 8).
Judges were seen as the greatest support-
ers of teen court programs. More than 9 in
10 teen courts rated their local judges as
“very supportive” (71 percent) or “moder-
ately supportive” (21 percent). Other
groups considered “very supportive” or
“moderately supportive” of teen courts
included law enforcement (87 percent),
court intake and probation workers (86
percent), teachers and other school offi-
cials (86 percent), and prosecutors
(84 percent). In general, teen courts per-
ceived all of the named groups to be sup-
portive. Even the groups ranking lowest
on the list (elected officials and the busi-
ness community) were considered by a
majority of teen courts as either very or
moderately supportive (78 and 67 per-
cent, respectively).
Problems
As small, community-based programs, teen
courts face a range of challenges and ob-
stacles. To identify the type of problems
facing teen courts, the survey asked each
program to review a list of typical opera-
tional problems that might cause difficul-
ties for teen courts. Each court was asked
to indicate whether it had experienced the
issue as a “serious” problem, a “minor”
problem, something in between, or not a
problem at all (see figure 9).
Not surprisingly, the operational problem
reported most often by teen courts was
funding (see figure 9). Forty percent of the
programs reported “some problems” (25
percent) or “serious problems” (15 per-
cent) with funding uncertainties. Only 38
percent of the programs reported that
funding uncertainties caused no problems.
Other problems that presented significant
challenges for teen courts included re-
taining youth volunteers (i.e., attorneys,
judges, and jurors) and maintaining an
adequate flow of referrals. More than
one-fifth (21 percent) of the programs re-
ported having “some” problems or “seri-
ous” problems keeping teen volunteers.
Nearly one-third (29 percent) reported
having “some” or “serious” problems with
maintaining sufficient case referrals.
Several other issues were described as
presenting “some” or “serious” problems
for teen courts. These issues included
cases in which too much time elapsed
between a youth’s arrest and his or her
referral to teen court (19 percent), diffi-
culties in coordinating the efforts of teen
courts with other agencies in the commu-
nity (16 percent), and problems recruiting
youth volunteers (19 percent) and adult
volunteers (20 percent).
Differences by program characteristics.
The extent to which teen courts reported
having problems in meeting specific chal-
lenges varied according to other program
characteristics. Some differences were
statistically significant. For example, teen
courts operated by schools or private
agencies were significantly more likely to
report problems with funding uncertain-
ties (see table 4). Among programs oper-
ated by private agencies and schools, 79
percent reported at least some problems

with funding, compared with 44 percent
of programs operated by courts and 49
percent operated by law enforcement or
prosecutors. Teen courts operated by
schools or private agencies were also sig-
nificantly more likely than programs run
by courts, law enforcement, or prosecu-
tors to report problems with a lack of ju-
dicial support (38 percent) and difficul-
ties coordinating with other agencies
(63 percent).
Smaller programs were somewhat more
likely than larger programs to report
problems with a lack of judicial support
and with a lack of clear program goals.
More than one-quarter (28 percent) of
teen courts that handled fewer than 50
cases per year reported having problems
with goal clarity, compared with 15 per-
cent of programs that handled more than
100 cases each year.
9
The length of time that teen courts had
been in operation was also associated
with problems regarding the clarity of
their goals. Programs less than 2 years old
were significantly more likely than pro-
grams in operation for 5 or more years to
report having problems with goal clarity
and with issues surrounding legal liability.
Finally, programs that relied heavily on pri-
vate funds (often those operated by private
agencies) were significantly more likely than
those that did not rely heavily on such funds
to report a lack of judicial support, coordi-
nation difficulties, a lack of adult volunteers,
and problems with retaining youth volun-
teers. Programs that depended on private
funding were also significantly more likely
to report problems with heavy caseloads.
Among programs that received more than
one-third of their funding from private
sources, 35 percent reported problems
stemming from too many referrals, com-
pared with 16 percent of programs that
received no private funding.
Evaluation Research
Despite broad and growing interest in
teen courts, only a few studies have
attempted to measure their effect on
youth, and even the best of these studies
have not yet produced the sort of evalua-
tion data necessary to deem a program
effective. Juvenile justice officials and
practitioners generally praise teen courts,
but these claims remain largely unsub-
stantiated. The Evaluation of Teen Courts
Project conducted a comprehensive re-
view of evaluation studies (published and

unpublished) conducted in the past 20
years. These studies examined teen and
youth court programs in States including
California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland,
New York, North Carolina, and Texas. All
of the studies were limited in scope and
methodology, but together they offered
insight to an essential question for State
and local officials, “Do teen courts work?”
Recidivism
Recidivism would seem to be an obvious
focus for evaluation studies of teen courts,
but only a handful of evaluations have
measured postprogram recidivism (see
table 5). Most studies have relied on court
records and official police data to detect
recidivism. Few studies have attempted to
collect personal data from teen court de-
fendants. Only Swink’s (1998) study of a
teen court program in Onondaga County,
NY, measured self-reported recidivism,
and it relied on parents to report the ille-
gal activities of their children.
Of the few studies that measured official
recidivism, some found very low rates of
reoffending among former youth court
defendants. Several researchers found
rates of postprogram recidivism that
ranged from 3 to 8 percent within 6 to
12 months of appearance in teen court
(Butler-Mejia, 1998; McNeece et al., 1996;
SRA Associates, 1995). A few studies
found recidivism rates in excess of 20 or
30 percent. One Texas study, for ex-
ample, found that 24 percent of former
youth court participants reoffended
(Hissong, 1991). Minor and his col-
leagues found that nearly one-third (32
percent) of teen court youth reoffended
within 1 year (Minor et al., 1999). It is not
possible to say whether these higher
rates are anomalies. Existing teen court
evaluations are so different in scope and
design that it is often impossible to com-
pare the findings of one with another.
Most evaluations of teen court recidivism
have employed relatively simple research
designs. Even some of the best studies (Mi-
nor et al., 1999; LoGalbo, 1998; Swink, 1998;
Wells, Minor, and Fox, 1998) have relied on
data from a single group of teen court
cases at a single point in time. Often, re-
searchers have failed to use comparison
groups or pre- and postmeasures. Thus, it
is impossible to test the assumption that
recidivism outcomes are due to teen court
rather than to other factors (e.g., the type
of youth selected for teen court may be
unlikely to recidivate).

Only three published studies (Hissong,
1991; North Carolina Administrative Office
of the Courts, 1995; Seyfrit, Reichel, and
Stutts, 1987) have used reasonably appro-
priate comparison groups to measure the
possible effects of teen courts on recidi-
vism (see table 5). Hissong’s evaluation
of an Arlington, TX, teen court compared
recidivism among teen court defendants
with a group of non-teen-court participants
matched on sex, race, age, and offense.
The analysis suggested that teen court
participants were significantly less likely
to reoffend than the comparison group
(24 percent versus 36 percent). Several
important elements of the study, however,
were poorly documented. The definition of
recidivism used in the analysis (presum-
ably rearrest) is unclear. The duration of
the followup period is not described (sub-
jects may have had different periods of
risk), and there is a range of unexplored
potential differences between the treat-
ment group and the comparison group.
The North Carolina study used a compari-
son group that consisted of 97 cases di-
verted by police during a 6-month period
prior to implementation of the teen court
in Cumberland, NC. Researchers hypoth-
esized that these youth would have been
referred to teen court had the program
been in existence. Teen court and com-
parison group cases were matched using
several factors, including demographic
characteristics and offense type, and re-
searchers tracked the recidivism of both
groups. The study failed to find statisti-
cally significant differences in the recidi-
vism of the two groups. In fact, the analy-
sis seemed to favor the comparison group.
After 7 months, 20 percent of teen court
participants had reoffended, compared
with just 9 percent of the comparison
group. The study also found little differ-
ence between the two groups in average
time before a new offense (4.1 months for
teen court offenders versus 4.6 months for
the comparison group). Youth who suc-
cessfully completed the teen court pro-
gram were less likely to reoffend than were
youth who began but failed to complete
the program (11 percent compared with
42 percent), but this finding may reflect
the greater tendency of low-risk youth to
complete the program.
Seyfrit and her colleagues (1987) tracked
recidivism outcomes for 52 youth referred
to a Columbia County, GA, teen court

Notes: Percentages may not equal 100 due to rounding. DA=District Attorney; n=number of respondents. Chi-square (“χ2”) measures the extent to which
the values of one variable are systematically different across the categories of one or more variables. Probability (“p”) measures the likelihood that a
statistical relationship is due to chance. Typically, a relationship between two variables is considered statistically significant when the probability is less
than 0.05. The correlation coefficient (“r ”) indicates the strength of association between two variables and ranges from –1.0 (strong inverse relationship)
to +1.0 (strong positive relationship).

during an 18-month period in the early
1980’s. They also collected data for a com-
parison group of 50 youth matched on de-
mographics and offenses. The study found
little difference between the two groups.
Although 12 percent of the comparison
group recidivated during the followup pe-
riod, the same was true for 10 percent of
the teen court defendants. Like the North
Carolina study, the Seyfrit study was un-
able to control statistically for different
periods of opportunity to reoffend. The
followup periods ranged from 6 to 18
months, which reduced the researchers’
ability to infer any real differences in the
recidivism of the two groups.
Other Outcomes
Several studies have suggested that teen
courts may have effects on youth other
than reduced recidivism. These potential
benefits include client satisfaction with
the teen court experience (Colydas and
McLeod, 1997; McLeod, 1999; Reichel and
Seyfrit, 1984; Swink, 1998; Wells, Minor,
and Fox, 1998), enhanced perceptions of
procedural justice (Butler-Mejia, 1998),
improved attitudes toward authority
(LoGalbo, 1998; Wells, Minor, and Fox,
1998), and greater knowledge of the legal
system (LoGalbo, 1998; Wells, Minor, and
Fox, 1998).1
For example, McLeod’s (1999) survey of
former teen court participants found that
at least 90 percent of youth referred to the
Colonie (NY) Youth Court during 1997 and
1998 believed that the experience in-
creased their understanding of the legal
system, helped them improve their behav-
ior, and helped them become more respon-
sible. Nearly all survey respondents (95
percent) reported that going through teen
court caused them to “make more thought-
ful decisions.” Nearly three in five (58 per-
cent) reported better communication with
their parents, and half (50 percent) re-
ported improved grades in school. How-
ever, the study’s very low response rate
(24 percent of youth surveyed) raised the
possibility that the youth responding to
the followup survey may have been the
most compliant and prosocial youth in
the sample.
LoGalbo’s (1998) evaluation of the Sarasota
County, FL, teen court program also found
(continued on page 14)

is also associated with positive outcomes for youth
volunteers. For information about prevention and law-
related education outcomes for youth volunteers, see

that teen court positively affected defend-
ant attitudes toward authority and under-
standing of the legal process. LoGalbo
surveyed 111 youth immediately after
their initial interview with teen court staff
and again upon completion of the program.
The survey asked participants about their
knowledge of Florida laws and the justice
system, their attitudes toward nine author-
ity figures (e.g., police officer, judge, par-
ent, teacher), their attitudes toward teen
court and toward themselves, and their
perception of the fairness of teen court pro-
cedures. The study found teen court par-
ticipation was associated with increased
self-esteem and positive attitudes toward
select authority figures (e.g., judges). The
15
analysis also suggested that recidivism
was less likely among defendants with im-
proved attitudes toward authority figures.
Strong client satisfaction was also re-
ported by researchers in Kentucky. Exit
interviews conducted by Wells and col-
leagues (1998) revealed high levels of satis-
faction among 123 teen court participants,
with 84 percent indicating that their sen-
tences were fair. Several positive features
of the teen court experience were cited by
the Kentucky subjects, including “educa-
tional advantages” (37 percent) and the
actual sentences youth received (21 per-
cent). Teens also consistently indicated
that the opportunity to serve as a teen
court juror was an important, positive
aspect of the teen court process.
Conclusion
State and local jurisdictions across the
country are embracing teen court as an
alternative to the traditional juvenile jus-
tice system for their youngest and least
serious offenders. Many jurisdictions re-
port that teen court increases young of-
fenders’ respect for the justice system
and reduces recidivism by holding delin-
quent youth accountable for what is often
their first offense. Moreover, a teen court
may be able to act more quickly and more
efficiently than a traditional juvenile
court. Researchers are beginning to accu-
mulate a body of findings on the effective-
ness of teen courts, but more detailed
information is needed for future practice
and policy development.
The information discussed in this Bulletin
is part of the Evaluation of Teen Courts
Project, OJJDP’s response to the need for
more detailed research about teen courts.
The project, which is being conducted for
OJJDP by researchers at The Urban
Institute’s Justice Policy Center, is the
first national, multisite evaluation of teen
courts and youth courts. Four jurisdic-
tions are participating in the study—An-
chorage, AK; Tempe, AZ; Rockville, MD;
and Independence, MO. The teen courts
in these communities were selected for
the study to maximize the number of
courtroom models represented, the mix
of geographic locations, and the overall
quality and length of service of each
program. The project features a quasi-
experimental design with data in each
jurisdiction being collected on a group of
teen court participants and a comparison
group of youth handled using traditional
juvenile court procedures.
The Evaluation of Teen Courts Project is
designed to address some of the key issues
facing policymakers and practitioners as
they consider investing more heavily in
teen court programs in their own jurisdic-
tions. The study will provide answers to
the following questions:
N What do teen courts actually do with
young offenders?
N What type of sentences are typically
imposed on youth, and do the youth
comply?
N Are youth and parents satisfied with
their experiences in teen court?
N Do young offenders referred to teen
courts have lower rates of recidivism
than those handled in the traditional
juvenile justice system?
N Do juveniles show improved attitudes
toward law enforcement and the
courts and improved relations with
peers and family, and do they have a
better understanding of the conse-
quences of their illegal behavior?
N Do these outcomes vary across teen
court models and across subsets of
offenders?
N Have the most experienced teen courts
learned any lessons that can be shared
with other jurisdictions?
N What community-level factors contrib-
ute to the success of teen courts?
Findings from the entire Evaluation of
Teen Courts Project will be available in
2001. Policymakers and practitioners will
be able to draw on the study’s findings as
they consider whether teen courts and
youth courts should play a more promi-
nent role in each jurisdiction’s system for
responding to youthful offenders.
