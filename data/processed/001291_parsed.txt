ABSTRACT 
Increased production costs and potential benefits of maintaining surface residue has 
renewed interest in conservation tillage systems for peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production. 
We initiated a study to determine surface residue cover following two strip tillage systems 
(narrow vs wide), compare yields and sound mature kernels (SMK) of three peanut cultivars 
(Anorden, AP-3, and GA 02-C) across each strip tillage system with two row spacings (single vs 
twin), and evaluate soil moisture between these treatments.  Two experimental sites were 
established on a Malbis fine sandy loam (Fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Plinthic 
Paleudults) in Fairhope, AL and a Dothan loamy sand (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic, 
Kandiudults) in Headland, AL during the 2004 growing season.  First year results indicated that 
the narrow strip tillage system produced higher surface residue cover at the Fairhope location. 
Yield differences between cultivars showed that GA 02-C and AP-3 yielded higher than Anorden 
at Fairhope, while no yield differences were observed at Headland.  GA 02-C had higher SMK at 
both locations, but AP-3 SMK were higher than Anorden at Fairhope, while Anorden SMK were 
greater compared to AP-3 at Headland.  Strip tillage system or row pattern had no effect on yield 
or SMK at either location. 
Although not significant, soil moisture contents measured at 
Headland followed the same trend as measured peanut yields, while row spacing had no effect on 
soil moisture contents.  Preliminary results indicated that peanut conservation tillage practices 
may not require a wide tillage strip regardless of row pattern. 
INTRODUCTION 
Peanut tillage operations have typically involved moldboard plowing followed by several 
other tillage operations to create a smooth seedbed, bury crop residues that may potentially 
increase disease pressure, and bury weed seeds to inhibit their germination (Colvin and Brecke, 
1988; Hartzog and Adams, 1989).  However, concerns related to soil and wind erosion and the 
need to reduce production costs has prompted interest in conservation tillage methods for peanut 
production (Jordan et al., 2001b; Jordan et al., 2003). 
Conservation tillage benefits have been widely reported to enhance soil physical 
properties and these benefits can be attributed to the build-up of organic matter at the soil surface 
by maintaining crop residue and planting a cover crop.  Residues retained on the soil surface 
have been shown to improve moisture management by decreasing evaporation and increasing 
infiltration (Lascano et al., 1994). A typical peanut conservation tillage system involves planting 
a winter annual cereal cover crop, chemically terminating the cover crop in the spring, utilizing 
an in-row subsoiler with coulters and baskets (strip tillage) to prepare a seedbed, followed by the 
planting operation. However, this strip tillage operation typically disrupts approximately 1/3 of 
the row width.

Some peanut producers in the Southeast have shifted from single row patterns to twin 
row patterns spaced 7 to 9 in. apart, centered on 36 to 40 in. rows (Jordan et al., 2001a).  This 
shift to twin rows has been attributed to a decreased incidence of tomato spotted wilt tospovirus 
(TSWV) compared to single row patterns (Baldwin et al., 1998), which may contribute to 
increased peanut yields of twin row over single row patterns (Jordan et al., 2001a).  Twin row 
peanuts in a conservation system typically utilize the strip tillage system described above which 
disrupts a wider portion of the row to accommodate the twin rows.  A smooth seedbed is created, 
but the incorporation of beneficial surface residue occurs. 
Another form of strip tillage has been utilized for row crops that produce their fruit above 
ground, such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).  The same in-row subsoiler is used, but the 
coulters and baskets are replaced with rubber pneumatic tires to close the slit created by the 
subsoiler shank. 
This type of tillage operation provides belowground disruption of any 
compacted zones present beneath the row, while maximizing the amount of residue on the soil 
surface. Therefore, our objectives are to determine surface residue cover following two strip 
tillage systems, compare yield responses of three peanut cultivars across each strip tillage system 
with two row spacings, and evaluate soil moisture between these treatments. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
An experimental site was established at the Gulf Coast Research and Extension Center 
(GCS) in Fairhope, AL  and the Wiregrass Research and Extension Center (WGS) in Headland, 
AL during the 2004 growing season. Treatments consisted of three peanut cultivars, two tillage 
systems, and two row spacings with a split-split plot arrangement in a randomized complete 
block design with four replications at GCS and three replications at WGS.  Main plots were 
peanut cultivars, (AP-3, Anorden, and GA 02-C) sub-plots were tillage systems (narrow strip 
consisting of a coulter, shank, and press wheels; wide strip consisting of a coulter, shank, two 
sets of coulters, rolling basket, and drag chain), and sub sub-plots were row spacings (single and 
twin rows). Sub sub-plot dimensions were 12.7 ft. wide (4-38 in. rows) at GCS and 12 ft. wide 
(4-36 in. rows) at WGS with 30 ft. long rows.      
A rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop was established in fall 2003 with a no-till drill on a 
Malbis fine sandy loam at GCS and an oat (Avena sativa L.) cover crop was established with a 
no-till drill on a Dothan loamy sand at WGS.  Both cover crops were seeded at 90 lb ac-1 and 
chemically terminated the following spring.  Biomass samples were determined from each plot, 
immediately prior to termination, by cutting all aboveground tissue from two areas, each 
measuring 2.7 ft2. 
Approximately 3 wk after cover crop termination, each strip tillage configuration was 
performed in the appropriate plot and subsequent peanut cultivars were planted at 6 seed ft-1 for 
single and twin rows. Surface residue was determined for each plot using the line transect 
method (Morrison et al., 1993), prior to peanut emergence.  Soil water content was monitored 
during the growing season using ECH2O-20 probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA1) at 
WGS.  The probes were installed vertically in the row centers, with measurements taken between 
3- and 11-in of depth from the soil surface.  Data was collected every 15-min using self-
contained dataloggers. 
Peanuts were mechanically harvested from the two center rows of each plot to determine 
yield and SMK. Yield was determined by weighing freshly harvested nuts in the field and 
adjusting the weight based on a subsample that was dried to 10% moisture.  That subsample was

shelled and graded to determine SMK.  Cultural practices to control weeds, diseases, and insects 
were based on Alabama Cooperative Extension recommendations.   
Data were analyzed using a mixed model procedure provided by the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS Institute, 2001).  Treatment differences were considered significant if P > F was 
less than or equal to 0.05. Comparison among more than three treatment means were separated 
by the least significant difference (LSD).    
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Surface residue cover was higher for the narrow strip tillage system at both locations; 
however, the difference was only significant at GCS (Fig. 1).  Residue cover was greater for both 
strip tillage systems at GCS compared to WGS (Fig. 1).  This may be attributed to higher 
amounts of biomass produced by rye at GCS compared to oat biomass at WGS.  Previous 
research has shown that rye was superior to other cereal and legume cover crops, as well as, 
selected mixtures of cereals and legumes (Daniel et al., 1999).   
Peanut populations measured 3 wk after planting were between 3.5 and 4.0 seeds ft-1 
(data not shown). No interactions were observed for peanut yields or SMK between cultivars, 
strip tillage systems, and row pattern, therefore each of these effects will be presented separately. 
Peanut yields of AP-3 and GA 02-C were superior to Anorden at GCS, but they were not 
different from each other (Table 1).  These two cultivars also produced higher yields compared 
to Anorden at WGS, but no significant differences were observed (Table 1).  Peanut yields of all 
cultivars were higher at WGS than yields observed at GCS, although SMK were generally higher 
at GCS than WGS (Table 1). The cultivar GA 02-C produced the highest SMK at both locations, 
but AP-3 SMK were higher than Anorden at Fairhope, while Anorden SMK were greater 
compared to AP-3 at Headland (Table 1).   
The strip tillage system utilized at each location had no effect on peanut yields or SMK 
(Table 2).  These preliminary results indicate that the row pattern should not dictate which type 
of strip tillage system is used.  Coulters and baskets used behind the shank for a wide strip tillage 
system may not be necessary for twin row peanuts, allowing beneficial residue to remain on the 
soil surface.   
First year results indicated no differences existed between yields or SMK for single and 
twin rows at either location (Table 3).  Jordan et al. (2001a) showed inconsistent yield responses 
for twin rows over single rows across seven site-years, but seeding rates were higher for twin 
rows and all plots were planted with conventional tillage practices.  The lack of yield response 
for twin rows compared to single rows in our study may be attributed to the two conservation 
tillage systems used in the experiment.  Conventional tillage practices that leave the soil bare 
may attract thrips, which vector TSWV compared to soil covered with crop residue (Marois and 
Wright, 2003).  Since cover crop residues were retained in all plots, yield reductions associated 
with TSWV were diminished. 
Soil moisture was affected by peanut variety (Fig. 2).  Greater soil water contents were 
recorded with the AP-3, followed by the GA 02-C and Anorden, respectively.  Although yield 
differences were not significant, the soil water contents corresponded to observed yields at this 
location (Table 1). These differences in soil water content possibly reflect differences in water 
use efficiency by the three peanut cultivars. 
Seeding rates were the same for the single and twin row, and plant populations measured 
3 wk after planting were between 3.5 and 4.0 seed ft-1. For this reason the plant water demand

should have been similar for both treatments.  This was apparent in the soil water content 
between the single and twin row spacing, which showed no differences (Fig. 3). 
CONCLUSION 
Preliminary results indicate that the narrow strip tillage system produced higher surface 
residue cover at GCS. Yield differences between cultivars showed that GA 02-C and AP-3 
yielded higher than Anorden at GCS, while no yield differences were observed at WGS when 
averaged over tillage systems and row patterns.  The highest percentage of SMK for both 
locations were found in GA 02-C, but AP-3 SMK were higher than Anorden at GCS, while 
Anorden SMK were greater compared to AP-3 at WGS.  Yield and SMK were not influenced by 
strip tillage or row pattern at either location.  Although not significant, soil moisture contents 
measured at WGS followed the same trend as measured peanut yields, while row spacing had no 
effect on soil moisture contents.  First year results indicate that peanut conservation tillage 
practices may not require a wide tillage strip, regardless of row pattern, but continuing research 
will help confirm these findings.
