Contrary to conventional wisdom, our puriﬁed La22xSr12xMn2O7 crystals exhibit CE-type orbital and
charge order as the low-temperature ground state for a hole doping level h  0:5. For small deviations
from h  0:5, the high-temperature CE phase is replaced at low temperatures by an A-type antiferro-
magnet without coexistence. Larger deviations result in a lack of CE order at any temperature. Thus, small
inhomogeneities in cation or oxygen composition could explain why others commonly see this reentrance
with coexistence.

The quest to better understand strongly correlated elec-
trons is at the heart of condensed matter inquiry. Colossal
magnetoresistive manganites exhibit a particularly vigo-
rous competition among orbital, charge, and spin order
[1,2]. The phase diagrams, e.g., La1xSrxMnO3 or the
bilayer version La22xSr12xMn2O7, display interesting
features near half doping (x  0:5) where, e.g., long-range
orbital and ‘‘checkerboard’’ charge ordering (CE type) is
predicted [3]. In bilayer manganites, it has been commonly
accepted that CE order at x  0:5 is reentrant [4–10]: it
forms below 210 K, but then is replaced by an A-type
antiferromagnet (AAFM) below 100 K. The lack of a
low-temperature CE ordered ground state is surprising as it
is found at x  0:5 in many perovskite manganites [11]. In
bilayer manganites, coexistence of CE order and AAFM
between 100 and 200 K is also universally reported
[4–7,9].
All reports of reentrance in LaSr2Mn2O7 are based on
superlattice peaks in neutron [4–7], x-ray [6–10], and
electron [12–14] diffraction and/or a peak in the resis-
tivity [4,6,8,12]. However, consistent with our own ex-
perience, these reported properties quoted as x  0:5
doping are variable. This implies an exquisite sensitivity
to
the
exact
value
of
hole
doping,
h  x  
in
La22xSr12xMn2O7. This dictates a vital burden to
obtain sample uniformity. Thus, in the present study we
have puriﬁed large single crystals, which often exhibit
compositional gradients, by cleaving them into very small
crystals (1 mg) and discarding those that do not pass our
test for uniformity (see below). Combining conductivity,
magnetization, and neutron and high-energy x-ray diffrac-
tion data on such highly homogeneous crystals, we here
show that the CE order predicted by Goodenough [3] is the
low-temperature ground state, presumably at h  0:5, and
that coexistence of CE and AAFM order is absent. We
argue that reentrance only occurs for small deviations from
0.5 and propose a revised phase diagram for bilayer man-
ganites near h  0:5.
Crystals were melt grown in an optical image furnace
[15]. The c axis is perpendicular to the platelike crystals
(2  0:5  0:1 mm3) and four gold pads are deposited
along the top and bottom surfaces for transport measure-
ments. In order to obtain a direct measure of the different
order parameters, we performed high-energy synchrotron
x-ray scattering experiments at the 1-ID-C station of the
Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory
and neutron scattering experiments at the BT-7 triple-axis
instrument at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. We
utilize the (9=4; 1=4; 0) reﬂection obtained using 80 keV
x rays and the neutron intensities of the (1=4; 1=4; 3) and
(1; 1; 3) reﬂections as measures of the CE orbital order, the
CE antiferromagnetic order (CEAFM), and the A-type
antiferromagnetic order, respectively [4].
Since four-terminal methods are unreliable for bulk
crystals, we use six terminals to determine each principal
component of conductivity, i.e., along the c axis, c, and in
the ab plane, ab [16]. In transport method A, current is
injected through the outermost contacts on one surface
[Fig. 1(a)]. Laplace’s equation is solved and inverted to
get ab and c from voltages measured across the inner-
most contacts of each surface. In method B, Laplace’s
equation is solved for current injection through the top
and bottom contacts at one end of the crystal, while volt-
ages are measured between pairs of contacts on the top and
bottom of the crystal [Fig. 1(b)].

To test for homogeneity, we evaluate ab and c in four
conﬁgurations. Two use method A with current applied to
the outer contacts of either the top or bottom surfaces and
two use method B with current applied to the end contacts
on either the right-hand or left-hand sides. We require both
abT and cT to be qualitatively the same for all four
conﬁgurations and within a factor of 2–3 in magnitude.
Crystals used for Figs. 2 and 3 all pass our criteria, as
described in Ref. [17]. Homogeneous crystals with a nomi-
nal x  0:5 fall into three batches: batch A are reentrant,
batch B exhibits CE order as the predominant low-
temperature ground state, and batch C never exhibit CE
order. Examples of these are indicated in the highly sche-
matic phase diagram of Fig. 4. The fact that we see three,
and only three, unique states using four different bulk
probes is unmistakable evidence of sufﬁcient composi-
tional uniformity. Any broad distribution of h  x  
would result in the coexistence of these states in some of
the 12 crystals studied. The relevance of  is seen in one
reentrant crystal that transformed into a nonreentrant crys-
tal after annealing in pure oxygen for 60 hrs at 600 C. Our
scattering probes show that our samples consist of up to
two or three slightly misaligned crystallites but are free
from any impurity phases within our detection limits.
Most of our crystals of nominal x  0:5 composition
display a transition from a paramagnetic insulator (PMI)
above 200 K into a CE-type orbital and charge-ordered
state. This is often (batch A) followed by a hysteretic
transition
into
a
state
with
higher
magnetization
[Fig. 2(a)] and conductivity [Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)] below
100 K that does not exhibit the CE-type superlattice
reﬂections [Figs. 2(d) and 3]. Our neutron diffraction
data [Fig. 2(e)] conﬁrm that the low-temperature state is
the previously identiﬁed AAFM [4–7]. However, in sev-
eral crystals (batch B) no more than a few percent
[Figs. 2(f)–2(j)] transformed into the AAFM. A natural
explanation is that CE order is the stable ground state only
over a very narrow range of h and there are crystal-to-
crystal variations of the average hole doping hhi and a ﬁnite
width of the distribution h. Thus, when hhi is most
favorable for CE order, presumably at 0.5 as predicted by

Goodenough [3], a larger fraction of the crystal would
exhibit the CE ground state at low temperatures. Then
for sufﬁciently small h, the CE ground state can be the
majority phase. For crystals exhibiting reentrance we be-
lieve hhi differs somewhat from 0.5. We also ﬁnd crystals
(batch C) without a transition to the CE state, implying that
hhi is yet further from 0.5. The conductivity data for
batch-C crystals are very similar to that of Ref. [18] and
are shown in Fig. 3(a) for a nominal doping x  0:48. Note
that the sharp decrease in c at 200 K, found in the
reentrant and nonreentrant crystals, is entirely absent, and
the conductivity changes directly from the PMI to the
AAFM behavior.
Data on batch-A crystals display a striking temperature
dependence and hysteresis in ab and c and magnetiza-
tion, as shown in Figs. 2(a)–2(c) and 3(a). Similar hys-
teresis is also found in the diffraction data of Figs. 2(d),
2(f), and 3(b) and in the data of others [4,7]. Such hystere-
sis was also reported in resonant x-ray studies [9], but we
are unaware of reports of such dramatic hysteresis in the
conductivity or magnetization of LaSr2Mn2O7. The drops
in our conductivity and magnetization data exhibit a simi-
lar temperature range and hysteresis as all the published
diffraction data [4,7,9]. A striking conclusion of our neu-
tron diffraction data for this batch-A crystal is the lack of
coexistence of CE and AAFM order, which is universally
found by others [4,6,7]. Neutrons probe AAFM and
CEAFM order [Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)], the latter of which
only occurs below 130 K (above 130 K the CE state is
paramagnetic). In warming and cooling cycles, one, and
only one, state is ever found. This conclusion is possible
because of the small h in our crystals. Near the lower-
temperature transition of batch-A crystals, we found evi-
dence for sluggish kinetics that was assisted by magnetic
ﬁelds of 7 T. This may imply a small energy difference
between these states since the change in magnetization at
the transition is only 2 emu=g. Further, the broad thermal
hysteresis associated with reentrance implies there is only
a slight difference in the temperature dependencies of their
free energies.
Crystals from batch B exhibit a similar high-temperature
transition, but only a trace of the lower-temperature tran-
sition to AAFM states. This is clearly seen in magnetiza-
tion [Fig. 2(f)] and conductivity [Figs. 2(g) and 2(h)].
Apparently the free energy for CE order, that is the ma-
jority phase of batch-B crystals, is sufﬁciently low so that
CE order remains stable down to low temperatures. Since
CE order has a sharp minimum in its free energy for h
exactly 0.5, batch-B crystals should have hhi very close to
that value. We conﬁrm the low-temperature CE state
through the CEAFM reﬂection [Fig. 2(i)] by neutron dif-
fraction in a slightly larger nonreentrant crystal. A minor
part of batch-B crystals may transform into the AAFM
below 100 K [Fig. 2(j)]. Others [7,10] have identiﬁed a
weak CE superlattice peak at low temperatures which
decays upon warming to above 50 K, but then reappears
as a strong peak at 120 K. This has the appearance of a
nonequilibrium ‘‘quenched-in’’ CE state, that is then an-
nealed out upon warming to 50 K. To dispel this possi-
bility and address thermodynamic stability, we monitor
these reﬂections during slow cooling (&1 K= min) that
should minimize quenched-in CE order due to sluggish
kinetics. We ﬁnd that the CEAFM reﬂection is reversible
upon slow heating [Fig. 2(i)], and conclude that the CE
phase is the low-temperature ground state in a majority of
each batch-B crystal.
For batch-B crystals, the succession of states with de-
creasing temperature (shown schematically in Fig. 4) can
be cast in terms of entropy. Transforming from the PMI to a
charge-ordered paramagnet (CEPM) gains orbital and
charge order while the onset of AFM in the CE state at
130 K additionally gains magnetic order. Transitions
between the AAFM and CEAFM states are more complex:
the internal energy for a CEAFM increases as h deviates
from 0.5 while the broad hysteresis implies similar tem-
perature dependencies of their free energies. Therefore the
phase boundary is almost vertical versus h. Batch-A crys-
tals also transform from PMI to CEPM at 200 K but CE
order appears to be metastable at lower temperatures
(dashed lines in Fig. 4) until it transforms at 100 K to
the AAFM ground state. Within this metastable region, the
CE state develops CEAFM order below 130 K due to a
gain in magnetic entropy. Upon warming, CEAFM order is
absent and AAFM order persists until CEPM order is
thermodynamically stable (T > 130 K). Thus it appears

that the magnetic entropy gain in the CEPM is necessary to
overcome the barrier between AAFM and CE states upon
warming.
Batch-C crystals show no evidence in conductivity or
high-energy x-ray diffraction for CE order although they
were made with a nominal composition of x  0:5. The
CE superlattice reﬂections seen in batch-A and batch-B
crystals were missing at all temperatures down to 100 K.
Curiously, all previously published conductivity data
[4,6,8,11] and in particular [18] known to us and quoted
as x  0:5 look more like our batch-C crystals, although
some show a small hysteresis [4,6,8]. A resistivity com-
parison [19] among these indicates a remarkable consis-
tency in temperature dependence and thus establishes our
batch-C crystals as a commonly seen variant quoted to be
the x  0:5 layered manganite. The data of Refs. [6,8] do
show a somewhat larger resistivity peak at 180 K that
could be the signature of some CE order in their crystals
and each of these report the CE reﬂection. However, the
resistivity peak associated with CE order in our batch-A
crystals is at least 10 times larger than the maximum value
reported by others [6,8]. This may imply CE order occurs
in a larger fraction of our puriﬁed batch-A crystals.
The electronic nature of AAFM states near h  0:5 is
not so easily determined. Conductivity for x  0:58 crys-
tals indicates ab-plane metals [20], whereas insulating
behavior is seen for x  0:46 [21]. Conductivity data for
the AAFM states of batch-A and batch-C crystals fall
between these two extremes. A possible scenario is a
continuous ab-plane metal-to-insulator transition as h de-
creases from 0:58 to 0:46. In this picture the CE order
replaces the AAFM over a limited h range centered at 0.5,
but the h dependence of the AAFM states are otherwise
unaffected.
In summary, contrary to published data and accepted
wisdom for LaSr2Mn2O7, we show that
the zero-
temperature ground state is the CE type predicted by
Goodenough [3]. We also ﬁnd no evidence of CE and
AAFM coexistence. That we do not know the exact h
values is not critical to these two new observations, but
compositional purity was crucial to these discoveries. It
was accomplished by stringent testing of small (1 mg)
crystals and veriﬁed by our observations with bulk probes
of only three, unique, states in the 12 crystals tested. The
lack of sufﬁcient purity could explain why others consis-
tently see coexistence of CE and AAFM order.
