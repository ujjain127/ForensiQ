The Emergence of India’s Pharmaceutical Industry

The Emergence of India’s Pharmaceutical Industry and 
Implications for the U.S. Generic Drug Market
William Greene
U.S. International Trade Commission
ABSTRACT: This paper presents an overview of India’s pharmaceutical industry and its
evolution from almost non-existent to one of the world’s leading suppliers of generic drugs. The Indian
pharmaceutical industry was allowed to take off when India met its WTO TRIPs obligations and
amended its patent laws with the passage and implementation of the Patents (Amendments) Act 2005.
When India re-instituted “product” patents, it effectively ended 36 years of protection for Indian
companies and terminated legal reverse engineering or copying of patented foreign pharmaceuticals
drugs. To meet the short fall in revenues, many of India’s leading pharmaceutical companies turned to
foreign acquisitions and exports, especially to the United States. Indian companies benefit from a
greater acceptance of generic drugs among the U.S. public, tremendous pressure on healthcare
providers to reduce costs, and impending expiration of patents on drugs with annual sales of $50
billion. India’s major pharmaceutical companies are positioning themselves to offer generic versions of
these drugs and some have predicted that they will capture at least 30 percent of the U.S. generic
replacement market. However, Indian companies face severe price compression in the U.S. for their
generic drug market and stiff competition from domestic U.S. generic manufactures and suppliers from
other low-cost countries.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs): an application submitted to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
by a generic drug manufacturer challenging a patent held by an innovator company. Once approved, an applicant
may manufacture and market the generic drug product of an existing formulation to the American public.
Active pharmaceutical ingredient (APIs): the primary, active ingredient(s) of a final pharmaceutical product,
produced in the first stage of pharmaceutical production and usually in bulk quantities.
Biologicals: medical preparation made from living organisms and their products, such as insulin, erythropoietin, and
vaccines.
Blockbusters: industry term referring to drugs with very large sales, generally in excess of $1 billion.
Branded generics: generic drugs for which a drug manufacturing company has attached its brand name and may
have invested in its marketing to differentiate it from other generic brands.
iii
Brand name drugs: innovator drugs patented by MNC pharmaceutical companies to prevent them from being
copied or reverse engineered by other companies. 
Bulk drugs: the active chemical substances in powder form, the main ingredient in pharmaceuticals - chemicals
having therapeutic value, used for the production of pharmaceutical formulations. Major bulk drugs include
antibiotics, sulpha drugs, vitamins, steroids, and analgesics.
Drugs: there are two types of drugs: bulk drugs (intermediates) and formulations.
Drug intermediates: these drugs are used as raw materials for the production of bulk drugs, which are either sold
directly or retained by companies for the production of formulations.
Drug Master files (DMFs): generic registration applications filed with the U.S. FDA in order to allow the active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to appear in marketed drugs.
Essential drugs: Drugs classified as essential by the Indian government consist of antibiotics, antibacterials, anti-
TB, penicillin and its salts, anti-parasitic, cardiovascular drugs, erythromycin and its preparations, vitamins and pro-
vitamins, vaccines (polio, human and veterinary), preparations containing insulin, caustic and other hormones, and
tetracycline and its preparations. Indian companies dominate this class of drugs with a domestic Indian market share
of 71 percent. These drugs are subject to government price controls.
Formulations: drugs ready for consumption by patients (generic drugs) sold as a brand or generic product as tablets,
capsules, injectables, or syrups. Formulations can be subdivided into two categories: generic drugs and branded
drugs.
Generic drugs: copies of off-patent brand-name drugs that come in the same dosage, safety, strength, and quality
and for the same intended use. These drugs are then sold under their chemical names as both over the counter and
prescription forms. Also, referred to as unbranded formulations.
Hatch-Waxman Act (Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act): passed in 1984, it established the
ANDA process that permits the U.S. FDA to approve generic versions of approved innovator drugs without
supplying clinical trials or New Drug Application (NDA) performed by the innovator company. 
Innovator drugs: are drugs with patents on their chemical formulation or on their production process. They have
been tested and approved by the U.S. FDA after extensive clinical trials.
New Drug Applications (NDAs): the vehicle through which drug innovators formally propose that the U.S. FDA
approve a new drug for sale and marketing in the United States.
Pharmaceuticals: are used to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure diseases in humans and animals. 
Plain vanilla generics: commodity generics that are “off-patent” in the regulated markets. They offer little or no
innovative value over the innovator’s product. 
Prescription drugs: medicines that encompass two classes, innovator drugs and generic drugs. 
Proprietary drugs: drugs that have a trade or brand name and are protected by a patent.
West/ Western: the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.

Overview  
The Indian pharmaceutical industry is
one of the developing world’s largest and most
developed, ranking 4  in the world in terms of
th
production volume and 13  in domestic
th
consumption value.  India’s industry, valued at
2
$5.3 billion in 2005, represents less than one
percent of the global pharmaceutical industry
($550 billion).  
3
Over the last 30 years, India’s
pharmaceutical industry has evolved from
almost nonexistent to a world leader in the
production of high quality generic drugs. India
has garnered a worldwide reputation for
producing high quality, low cost generic drugs.
The industry currently meets India’s demand for bulk drugs and nearly all its demand for formulations,
with the remainder supplied by foreign multinational corporations (MNCs).
India’s pharmaceutical industry is one of the fastest growing segments of the Indian economy
with an average annual growth rate of 14 percent during 2002-2005. Overall, the Indian market for
pharmaceuticals is projected to grow at an average annual rate of between 15 and 20 percent during 2005
- 2010. The surge in production has been driven by legislative reforms, the growth in contract
manufacturing and outsourcing, value added foreign acquisitions and joint ventures, India’s mastery of
reverse engineering of patented drug molecules, and India’s efforts to comply with its World Trade
Organization (WTO) Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) obligations.
When India joined the WTO in 1995, its pharmaceutical exports were valued at less than $600
million. By 2005, its exports had grown to $3.7 billion and accounted for more than 61 percent of
industry turnover. Currently, Indian pharmaceutical companies produce between 20 and 22 percent of the
world’s generic drugs (in value terms) and offer 60,000 finished medicines and nearly 400 bulk drugs
used in formulations.4
With changes in India’s patent laws in the early 1970s, Indian drug producers became experts in
‘reverse engineering’ and increased its supply of less expensive copies of the world’s best-selling patent-
protected drugs. India’s pharmaceutical industry grew and prospered in a highly regulated environment
with government price controls on a significant number of formulations and bulk drugs. In January 2005,
India amended its patent laws governing pharmaceuticals, bringing them into conformance with the WTO
TRIPs agreement. Under the new patent law, Indian drug markers can no longer manufacture and market
reverse-engineered versions of drugs patented by foreign drug producers. To replace sales lost to TRIPs
compliance, many of India’s leading pharmaceutical producers have increased their exports of generic
drugs to the United States and Western Europe and entered into research and development agreements,
mergers and acquisitions, and other alliances with foreign pharmaceutical firms.

India’s Pharmaceutical industry: independence to 2005
At the time of independence in 1947, India’s pharmaceutical market was dominated by Western
MNCs that controlled between 80 and 90 percent of the market primarily through importation.
Approximately 99 percent of all pharmaceutical products under patent in India at the time were held by
foreign companies and domestic Indian drug prices were among the highest in the world. The Indian
pharmaceutical market remained import-dependent through the 1960s until the government initiated
policies stressing self-reliance through local production.  At that time, 8 of India’s top 10 pharmaceutical
5
firms, based on sales, were subsidiaries of MNCs. To facilitate an independent supply of pharmaceutical
products in the domestic market, the government of India founded 5 state-owned pharmaceutical
companies.  Today, India is the world’s fifth largest producer of bulk drugs.  
6
Government policy culminated in various actions including: the abolition of product patents on
food, chemicals, and drugs; the institution of process patents; the limitation of multinational equity share
in India pharmaceutical companies, and the imposition of price controls on certain formulations and bulk
drugs. Subsequently, most foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers abandoned the Indian market due to the
absence of legal mechanisms to protect their patented products. Accordingly, the share of the domestic
Indian market held by foreign drug manufacturers declined to less than 20 percent in 2005. As the MNCs
abandoned the Indian market, local firms rushed in to fill the void, and by 1990, India was self-sufficient
in the production of formulations and nearly self-sufficient in the production of bulk drugs. 
Regulatory environment 
 
To end the dominance of foreign drug companies, the Indian government enacted a series of
policies designed to foster self-sufficiency in the production of basic drugs. Because these measures
lowered barriers to entry, thousands of medium and small Indian pharmaceutical companies entered the
market challenging the MNCs for control. These actions laid the foundation for today’s highly
competitive domestic industry that is capable of offering some of the lowest drug prices in the world.
These policies ended India’s dependence on expensive foreign drugs, fostered the development of a
competitive pharmaceutical industry, and guaranteed the Indian public access to inexpensive drugs.
Nonetheless, the Indian pharmaceutical industry also became one of the country’s most heavily regulated.
The industry currently faces restrictions on imports, high tariff rates, ration requirements, and equity
ceilings for foreign participation.
The Patent Act, 1970: The Act’s stated objective was to foster the development of an
indigenous Indian pharmaceutical industry and to guarantee that the Indian public had access to low-cost
drugs.  The Act replaced intellectual property rights laws left over from the British colonial era and
7
ended India’s recognition of Western-style “product” patent protection for pharmaceuticals, agricultural
products, and atomic energy. Product-specific patents were disregarded in favor of manufacturing
“process” patents that allowed Indian companies’ to reverse engineer or copy foreign patented drugs
without paying a licensing fee. This allowed the domestic industry build up considerable competencies
and offer a large number of cheaper “copycat” generic versions legally in India at a fraction of the cost of

 Novartis (Switzerland) recently challenged India’s patent laws before the Chennai High Court alleging that India’s
12
refusal to grant a patent on its leukemia anti-cancer drug, Gleevec, violated the WTO’s TRIPs agreement. In Jan. 2006, India’s
patent office rejected the patent application insisting that Gleevec was only a new form of an existing drug and was therefore not
patentable in India. Amy Yee, “Novartis in Indian patent dispute,” Financial Times, Dec. 22, 2006. “Novartis contests India’s

the drug in the West, as long as they employed a production process that differed from that used by the
patent owner. The Act protected process patents for 7 years instead of the usual 15 years needed to
develop and test new drugs.
Drug Price Control Order, 1970 (DPCO): The order was introduced when most of India’s
drugs were under strict price controls. Since its introduction, the number of bulk drugs under price
controls gradually declined from 347 in 1987 to 163 in 1994 to 74 in 1995.  In 2005, the government 
8
capped prices on 74 bulk drugs and 260 formulations that account for approximately 25 percent of
India’s retail pharmaceutical market (attachment).  Trade margins for these drugs were capped at 8
9
percent for retailers and 16 percent for wholesalers. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority,
founded in 1997, is responsible for monitoring prices using the DPCO to fix ceiling prices on drugs and
ensure that no Indian company in a monopoly position takes advantages of its monopolistic position by
profiteering. In June 2006, the National Pharmaceutical Policy 2006 (Part A) proposed to add price
controls on 354 specific drugs listed as essential medicines.  The new policy will cap margins on generic
10
drugs at 15 percent for wholesalers and 35 percent for retailers. It will also enforce a 5 percent price cut
on more than 75 commonly-used medicines resulting from import duty reductions of 5 to 7.5 percent on
certain active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).  The NPPA controls ceiling prices for controlled bulk
11
drugs in all intra-industry transactions as well as the retail ceiling prices for controlled formulations. 
Patents (Amendment) Act 2005:  To meet its TRIPs obligations, India amended its patent
12
law on March 22, 2005, abolishing its “process” patents law and reintroduced Western style “product”
patents for pharmaceuticals, food, and chemicals.  This action effectively ended 36 years of protection
13
for Indian pharmaceutical companies and stipulated that Indian companies selling copycat drugs must
pay foreign patent holders a “reasonable” royalty for copies sold in the Indian market. The amendment
made reverse engineering or copying of patented drugs illegal after January 1, 1995. The Act allowed for
only two types of generic drugs in the Indian market: off-patent generic drugs and generic versions of
drugs patented before 1995. At present, nearly 97 percent of all drugs manufactured in India are off
patent and therefore will not be affected by this Act. It also introduced a provision establishing
compulsory licenses for exports to least developed countries with insufficient pharmaceutical
manufacturing capacities. 
The Amendment grants new patent holders a 20-year monopoly starting on the date the patent
was filed and, without a compulsory license, no generic copies can be sold during the duration of the
patent. The WTO also required India to establish a “mailbox” where patent applications could be filed
between January 1, 1995 and 2005. The Act encouraged significant numbers of foreign pharmaceutical

companies to participate in the Indian market and, in 2005, foreign drug producers filed approximately
8,926 patent applications to cover their patented drugs sold as generics in the Indian market. Roche
(Switzerland) became the first foreign company to win a patent under India’s new product patent regime
and that patent, granted in March 2006 for a drug to treatment of hepatitis C (Pegasys), will be valid for
20 years from May 15, 1997. Pfizer (US) has submitted the largest number of patent applications (373)
followed by Johnson & Johnson (262) and Procter & Gamble (187). 14
Industry production
Thirty-five years of protection has enabled the Indian pharmaceutical industry to perfect its
scientific and manufacturing capabilities, allowing many of its leading companies to move up the value-
added chain. India’s pharmaceutical industry consists of large, medium, and small companies and is one
of the world’s most price competitive. It is also highly fragmented with more than 20,000 domestic
production units. Because of low barriers to entry and low capital requirements, the number of domestic
pharmaceutical firms engaged in the formal and informal sectors expanded dramatically from 2,257 in
1970 to more than 20,000 in 2005 (table 1).  Because many of these companies focus of producing
15
similar generic drugs, with possibly hundreds of companies producing the same drug, the industry is
characterized by fierce competition and high volumes, razor-thin profit margins, overcapacity, and
declining prices. According to FICCI, there are only 6,000 firms participating in the formal sector that 
have received drug manufacturing licenses from the Indian government.  India’s pharmaceutical firms
16
can be differentiated by size, annual sales, function, export markets, and R&D capabilities (table 1).

Grouping
Number of firms
Description
Group 1
100
Largest firms, includes both wholly-owned Indian firms and subsidiaries of MNCs; have
annual revenues of at least $650,00; have brand recognition and are engaged in
developing R&D capabilities; responsible for recent wave of cross-border acquisitions
and alliances; export to regulated, semi-regulated, and unregulated markets. 
Group 2
200
Mid-size firms with annual revenues between $210,410 and $650,000; they have limited
investment capabilities and primarily serve the domestic Indian market. They are generic
drug producers that subsist mainly on reverse engineering of patented and off-patent
drugs (primarily bulk drugs and APIs); also includes niche players specializing in
contract research (CRAMS) and contract clinical trials in segments of the market where
they have a competitive advantage; export to semi-regulated and unregulated markets. 
Group 3
5,700
Smallest firms with annual revenues of less than $210,410;.primarily perform contract
manufacturing services for MNCs or domestic firms. Many have been adversely affected
and have been forced to close their doors due to revised Good Manufacturing Practices 
set by Schedule M of India’s Drug and Cosmetic Act, 1940 that came into effect from
July 1, 2005. Those affected cannot meet production standards of regulated market
regulators and their production will be limited to the domestic, semi-regulated, and
unregulated markets.

The vast majority of India’s pharmaceutical firms are small by global standards with annual
revenues of less than $5 million. The Confederation of India Industries (CII) estimates that approximately
80 percent of them are engaging in some type of contract manufacturing or outsourcing.  The largest 250
17
companies control nearly 70 percent of the domestic market with the top 10 controlling approximately 40
percent. The domestic Indian pharmaceutical industry consists of both domestic companies and
subsidiaries of MNCs. In the 1970s, the vast majority of foreign pharmaceutical companies abandoned
the Indian market during the “process” patent era due to inadequate product protection, government price
controls, growing domestic competition, and declining prices and profitability. Consequently, the share
of India’s market controlled by multinationals dropped to less than 20 percent by 2005.
In the absence
18
of government protection, India’s leading drug producers are moving toward new drug discovery rather
continuing to rely solely on copying patented foreign drugs. Industry experts project that by 2010, Indian
firms will produce 6 of the top 10 drugs scheduled to lose their patent protection in developing
countries.19
Indian pharmaceutical companies now supply nearly all the country’s demand for formulations 
and nearly 70 percent of its demand for bulk drugs. Indian firms produce nearly 60,000 generic brands in
60 therapeutic categories and between 350 and 400 bulk drugs. Approximately 80 percent of domestic
production consists of formulations, and more than 85 percent of those formulations are sold in the
domestic market, whereas at least 60 percent of bulk drug production is exported. Nearly 97 percent of
India’s drug market consists of second-and-third generation drugs no longer subject to patent protection
in the developed world. Some under-patent, lifesaving drugs continue to be imported, primarily from
developed countries, especially the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France.
India has the world’s third-largest API manufacturing industry valued at nearly $2 billion in
2005. Currently, India’s drug industry produces more than 400 different APIs and is among the world’s
top 5 API producers accounting for approximately 6.5 percent of the world’s API production. Italy’s
Chemical Pharmaceutical Generic Association (CPA) projects that India’s share of the world API market
will grow to 10.5 percent by 2010 as patented blockbuster drugs lose their patent protection. The CPA
also expects that the domestic Indian market for APIs, both generic and branded, will rise from $755
million in 2005 to $1.9 billion in 2010.  According to the Assocham, the leading APIs were anti-
20
infectives, and gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory drugs (table 2). In terms of volume of
sales, the gastrointestinal and cardiac segments saw the highest rates of growth and accounted for the
largest number of new drug launches.

MNC presence in India: Many of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies have
subsidiaries or other operations in India. Multinational companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Baxter,
Aventis, Pfizer, Novartis, Wyeth, and Merck have been active in India’s pharmaceutical market mainly

through subsidiaries. The re-introduction of product patents precipitated the return of a large number of
other MNCs, some of whom left during the process patent era. MNC pharmaceutical companies have
also been attracted by tax holidays, the deduction of capital R&D expenditures, and other financial
incentives offered by the Indian government. Industry sources indicate that the most significant
challenges facing MNCs are the uncertainly over pharmaceutical price controls and data exclusivity.  
24
There are approximately 34 foreign drug companies engaged in the Indian pharmaceutical market
and among them are 15 of the world’s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies. According to FICCI,
although MNCs have not launched new products they have invested in new production facilities and
R&D centers and many are engaged in contract manufacturing, clinical trials, and other forms of
outsourcing.  In 2005-06, MNCs invested more than $172 million in India’s pharmaceutical industry and
25
FDI has grown by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of 62 percent during 2002-06.  However,
26
many industry experts believe that the return of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies will
gradually erode India’s cost advantages. According to the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of
India, multinational drug companies currently command 24 percent of the domestic Indian market,
through their share could rise to 40 percent by 2010.27
GSK-India, a 51 percent subsidiary of GSK Plc (UK), is the largest foreign company in India’s
pharmaceutical market, its fourth largest pharmaceutical company, and leading prescription drug
supplier. GSK-India operates two Indian manufacturing plants and controls approximately 5.9 percent of
the domestic Indian market. GSK-India is among India’s leading suppliers of anti-infective, anti-
inflammatory, analgesic, gastro-enterological, anti-allergic, and dermatological drugs. GSK-India
announced plans to extend its product line by launching several antibiotic, cancer, and cardiovascular
products in India in the near term. Likewise, MNCs dominate India’s OTC (over the counter) drug
market, with Pfizer accounting for 5.1 percent of the market, Sanofi-Aventis for 5.0 percent, and Johnson
& Johnson for 4.8 percent. These companies offer analgesics, cough and cold preparations, indigestion
medicines, skin care products, and vitamins and minerals. Other foreign multinationals active in India’s
pharmaceutical market include: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Boehringer, Bayer, Chiton Corp, Abbott,
AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Roche. 
Recently, Teva Pharma (Israel), the world’s leading generic drug manufacturing company,
acquired a bulk drug manufacturing and intermediate facility in the State of Uttar Pradesh, announced
plans to add two more units, and more than triple the value of its exports from India by the end of 2007.
Teva also opened an R&D facility in India and announced plans to register between 10 and 15 bulk drugs
per year in the United States from its Indian facilities.28
Industry structure
Mergers, acquisitions, and other alliances: The last 3 years have seen a significant rise in
the number of consolidations, mergers & acquisitions, and other types of alliances and tie-ins in the
Indian pharmaceutical industry. Most of the acquisitions involve Indian companies searching for ways to
penetrate overseas markets and widen their global footprint, diversify and enhance their product
portfolios, offer their customers a ‘nearshore-offshore’ option, improve their custom manufacturing,
packing, and R&D capabilities, acquire existing brands, and gain access to the highly regulated markets

of Western Europe and the United States. Indian companies without significant R&D capabilities for
drug discovery are also purchasing Western drug discovery companies.
In 2005-06, 18 Indian companies spent approximately $1.6 billion to acquire generic drug
manufacturing firms in Europe, North America, and Mexico.  These companies included Ranbaxy, Dr.
29
Reddy’s Labs, Nicholas Piramal, Sun Pharmaceutical, and Jubilant Organosys (table 5).  Although
30
eleven of these transactions were for medium-and-small sized companies valued between $5 million and
$30 million, several have been significant acquisitions valued in excess of $500 million. To date, Dr.
Reddy’s purchase of Betapharm Arzneimittel of Germany for $572 million is the industry’s largest
overseas acquisition. Other significant deals include Ranbaxy’s purchase of Terapia (Romania) and RPG
Aventis (France) and Matrix’s acquisition of API of Belgium. With these acquisition; Dr. Reddy’s
became Germany’s fourth largest generic drug company and Ranbaxy became Romania’s third largest
generic drug company and one of Belgium’s top 10 generic providers.  India’s pharmaceutical industry
31
should witness a significant decline in the number of smaller companies that either leave the market or
are acquired by larger Indian or foreign companies. Since 2000, a number of smaller Indian
pharmaceutical companies have been acquired by larger companies including Wockhardt’s acquisition of 
Merind and Tata Pharma; Ranbaxy’s purchase of Crosland; Nicholas Piramal’s acquisition of Roche,
Boehringer, and Sumitra Pharma, and Glaxo-Wellcome’s merger with Ciba-Sandoz. Matrix, one of
India’s and the world’s leading producers of APIs, was acquired by Mylan (US) in January 2007 for $546
million. Mylan, one of the largest generic drug producers in the United States, acquired Matrix to expand
its manufacturing capabilities, gain a foothold in key markets, and gain access to Matrix’s  technical and
scientific expertise.
Since 2005, Europe has become a counterweight to the U.S. market and its growing pricing
pressures. In exploring Western Europe for acquisitions, Indian pharmaceutical companies found a wider
range of companies available at more reasonable valuations.  The new patent regime is also forcing the
32
Indian pharmaceutical market to consolidate, and only firms with a global presence and significant R&D
capabilities for drug discovery, drug delivery systems, and technology licensing will prosper into the
future.

Contract research and manufacturing, outsourcing, and other services: The passage of
the Patents (Amendment) Act 2005 has significant implications for both Indian and multinational
companies competing in the Indian market. Leading Indian companies are moving away from a reliance
on the domestic market to the development new drugs, exports to regulated markets, and cooperative
agreements with MNCs. Facing lagging sales of patented drugs by MNCs in their home markets,
declining R&D revenues, and rising costs, many MNCs have turned to contract manufacturing and
research services (CRAMS), co-marketing alliances, outsourcing of research and clinical trials to reduce
costs, increase development capacity, and trim the ‘time to market’ for new drugs. These strategies
permit MNCs to focus on their core profit making activities (competencies), such as drug discoveries and
marketing, rather than on manufacturing. India has emerged as the principal destination for global
pharmaceutical companies across the pharmaceutical value chain. 
Indian pharmaceutical companies have two basic options: compete with MNCs for vanilla
generics and new chemical entities (new drugs) or co-operate (table 6). Subcontracting in India has
gradually moved up the value-added chain from intermediates and APIs to new drug discovery, clinical
trials, marketing, and sales. According to India’s Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FICCI), many Indian companies, especially those without the resources for R&D, are
embracing custom manufacturing, contract research, and marketing alliances to remain profitable.33
Others are planning to manufacture and export vanilla generics to regulated markets before eventually
producing either more difficult to manufacture generics or new chemical entities (proprietary drugs).

Contract research and (custom) manufacturing services (CRAMS): CRAMS can be
divided into 3 basic segments: the production of intermediates, active pharmaceutical ingredients for new
chemical entities, and the manufacture of generic drugs. India has emerged as one of the world’s leading
CRAMS providers for MNC innovator companies and now accounts for between 6 and 7 percent of the
global market and many expect India will command at least 15 percent of the market by 2009-10.
Although CRAMS is still in its nascent stages in India, it represents a significant opportunity for
medium-sized Indian pharmaceutical companies. 
In 2005, the Indian CRAMS market was estimated at $532 million with contract manufacturing
accounting for nearly 84 percent of the total.  The remainder consisted mainly of contract research (not
34
including clinical trails). Both contract research and contract manufacturing grew by more than 40
percent in 2005 compared with 2004 and industry experts maintain that Indian companies have the
capacity to gain between 35 percent and 40 percent of the global CRAMS market.  The Associated

market will reach $900 million by 2010 and the demand for contract clinical trials will grow from $100
million in 2005 to $200 million in 2007 and to $1 billion by 2010.  
36
India’s competitive advantage lies in its lower production and research costs, its large pool of
low cost technical and scientifically trained personnel, and the large number of U.S. FDA certified
plants.  Other important factors include the popularity of outsourcing non-critical business functions to
37
India by MNCs, the reintroduction of product patents for pharmaceuticals, the growing importance of
R&D related to drug discovery by Indian drug companies, and the growing demand for generic drugs in
developed markets. It is estimated that manufacturing costs in India are between 30 and 40 percent lower
than those in the United States and Western Europe and labor costs are one-seventh of that in the United
States.   
38
Nicholas Pirmal India Ltd. is India’s leading contract manufacturer with CRAMS contracts
valued at $250 million (table 7).  At present CRAMS accounts for approximately 30 percent of Nicholas 
39
Piramal’s total revenues in 2005 and plans to increase it to 50 percent by 2010.  In 2006, Nicholas
40
Piramal signed a 5-year, $350 million agreement with Pfizer for 12 products. The agreement made
Nicholas Piramal Pfizer’s largest custom manufacturing partner.  To augment its global contract
41
manufacturing capabilities, Nicholas Piramal purchased Pfizer’s contract manufacturing facility in the
United Kingdom (Morpeth) and Avecia Pharmaceutical. Its deal with Pfizer could potentially produce
much as $350 million for Nicholas Piramal by 2010. Likewise Jubilant Organosys booked contracts
worth $65 million for 2006 and 2007, and Shasun Chemicals and Drugs, India’s leading producer of
ibuprofen, bought the CRAMS business of Rhodia Pharma Solutions (France).  Dishman Pharma and
42
Divi specialize in contract manufacturing of patented drugs and custom synthesis; Shasun and Matrix
specialize in generics; and Shasun, Jubilant Organosys, Torrent, and Morepen specialize in old generics.
MNCs like Aventis, Bayer, and Roche have announced plans to make India their regional hub for APIs,
bulk drugs, and clinical research.43

 Clinical trials represent between 50 to 60 percent of a new drug’s development costs. By using India and other low-
45
cost countries, Western drug innovators can potentially reduce their costs per patient by 40 percent to 60 percent. Michael Block,

Contract outsourcing: Western pharmaceutical companies are now outsourcing a wide range of
activities including: the manufacture of APIs, chemical intermediates, and formulations; clinical research
and clinical testing; and packaging and labeling. The Indian market for contract outsourcing has been
driven by the need of leading MNC pharmaceutical companies to reduce production costs and increase
revenues. These companies have shifted portions of the production, research & development, clinical
trials, packaging and labeling, stability testing, and other types of drug development and discovery
activities to India. In 2004, India’s drug outsourcing sector was valued at $470 million and was expected
to grow by 30 percent per year to $800 million in 2005. Leading drug firms like Pfizer, AstraZeneca,
Novartis, and Eli Lilly have already begun shifting a portion of these activities to India.
According to India’s Chemical Pharmaceutical Generic Association, the domestic contract
research market is growing between 20 percent and 25 percent per year and was valued at $120 million in
2005 and is projected to grow to $200 million by the end of 2007. The Chemical Pharmaceutical Generic
Associations also predicted that this segment will reach $1 billion by 2010.  The Association indicated
44
that India dwarfs its nearest rivals, Italy ($60-$70 million) and Spain ($25 million to $33 million), and
projected that contract research in India will grow at an annual rate of between 20 percent to 25 percent.
Clinical trials represent 65 percent of this market and new drug discovery makes up the remaining 35
percent.  Companies active in India’s contract research market include: a limited number of
45
multinational corporations, subsidiaries of large international contract research firms (Quintiles,
Covance), joint ventures and tie-ins between Indian and foreign companies, and stand-alone and
offshoots of Indian companies. Several multinationals active in the Indian market have designated India
as a hub for their production of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished formulations. Divi Labs,
Shasun Chemicals & Drugs, and Dishman Pharmaceuticals are among India’s leading contract research
firms.
Research and development (R&D): With the reintroduction of product patents, leading
Indian pharmaceutical majors are altering their business strategies by placing greater focus on R&D and
the discovery of new chemical entities. Traditionally, the vast majority of India’s pharmaceutical R&D
spending was concentrated on reverse engineering and the adaptation of patented foreign drugs to the
Indian market. Most of the industry’s funding went to research rather than to new drug discovery and
development. Low levels of industry productivity and the relatively small size of India’s pharmaceutical
companies limited funding for R&D as they dedicated only less than 2 percent of their annual turnover to
R&D compared with between 15 percent and 20 percent allocated by Western innovator companies. 
After 2005, India’s leading drug companies recognized that they could not survive as global
players without significant R&D capabilities. Since 1995, total industry R&D spending has grown from
nearly $30 million to more than $495.3 million in 2005-06 (table 8).  The vast majority of the industry’s
46
R&D spending is conducted by 15 companies whose R&D spending rose to $192.3 million in 2005 from
$131 million in FY2004, representing an increase of 47 percent. R&D expenditures are expected to
gradually rise to between 9 percent and 10 percent of total industry spending by the end of 2007.  
47
Likewise, the vast majority of the industry’s R&D expenditures on new drug discovery and
development is conducted by a limited number of companies, with Dr. Reddy’s and Ranbaxy at the
forefront. In 2005, Dr. Reddy’s committed 14 percent of its annual sales to R&D, whereas, Ranbaxy

allocated approximately 7 percent. Ranbaxy announced that it will gradually increase its R&D spending
to between 9 and 10 percent of sales by the end of 2007. Others with significant R&D expenditures
include Nicholas Piramal, Aurobindo Pharma, and Glenmark Pharma.

Driven by the dynamics of the market, leading foreign pharmaceutical companies have entered
into R&D agreements with India’s leading drug companies. Facing spiraling costs and patent expiries for
blockbuster drugs at home, many are looking to India as a low-cost alternative, especially due to the large
number of U.S. FDA-approved plants located in India. MNCs have been attracted by India’s low costs
for new drug discovery and many of these firms have founded state-of-the-art research facilities in India.
Whereas new drug discovery costs between $100 million and $200 million in the West, the same process
in India only costs approximately $10 million.  Likewise, clinical trials in India cost approximately $20
48
million while the cost abroad would ranges between $300 million and $350 million.49
Strengths and weaknesses of India’s pharmaceutical industry: India’s comparative
advantages lie in its cost competitiveness, its reverse engineering experience, its large pool of less
expensive English-speaking scientific and engineering workers, and its well-developed chemical industry
infrastructure (table 9). India’s pharmaceutical companies can also operate at much lower profit margins
that their Western counterparts. Today, India produces some of the cheapest drugs in the world,
especially because labor costs are 50 to 55 percent cheaper than in the West.  Industry experts indicate
50
that infrastructure costs are 40 percent lower and fixed cost are estimated to be 12 percent to 20 percent
less that in the United States and Western Europe. Consequently, India can produce bulk drugs that cost
60 percent less that in the West and can open a production plant in India 40 percent cheaper than in
developed countries. Because of this, India has become a hub for pharmaceutical research and
development and clinical trials for many leading foreign pharmaceutical companies.

Indian Market
The Indian pharmaceutical market is small, both by Western standards and in terms of per capita
consumption. Although India is the world’s leading producer of generic drugs, its annual per capita
consumption of pharmaceuticals is among the lowest in the world at approximately $4.50 per person, as
compared with $820 in the United States and $13 in China in 2006. The value of India’s pharmaceutical
industry nearly doubled from $3.2 billion in 2000 to more than $6.2 billion in 2005, or by an average of
12 percent annually (table 10). According to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of
India (Assocham), the Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 13.6
percent during 2006-2010 to reach $9.5 billion in sales by 2010.  This
51
growth is expected to be driven by: access to low cost, high volume generic drugs; mergers and
acquisitions: industry consolidation; and India’s growing importance as a pharmaceutical contract
manufacturing and services location.  Approximately 80 percent of domestic industry production
52
consists of formulations, with the remainder consisting of bulk drugs.

In the post-product patents era, India’s domestic market is changing, reflecting rising disposable
incomes in urban areas and changes in India’s demographic profile. Leading drug companies are putting 
more emphasis on meeting a growing demand for high value low volume, Western-style “lifestyle”drugs
for wealthy urban customers who make up approximately 12 percent of the market.  This highly
53
lucrative market segment includes drugs for “chronic” or “lifestyle” diseases have grown from 10 percent
to 20 percent of the market in the mid-1990s to between 25 and 35 percent of the market today.   The
54
demand for these drugs is growing at a faster rate, at 18 percent, than domestic demand for the acute drug
segment (12 percent). India has often been called the world’s diabetes capital and the rates of aliments
like hypertension and high cholesterol are increasing annually. According to Sanjay Kaul, General
Manager of Mankind Pharma’s Product Division, the lifestyle drug segment will fuel the growth of
India’s pharmaceutical industry and includes anti-diabetes, anti-ulcer, anti-depressants, cardiovascular,
hypertension drugs, Alzheimers disease, osteoarthritis, and cancer.
Intense domestic competition, a growing reliance on exports by the largest producers, and India
as a growing market for contract manufacturing, contract research and development, and clinical trials,
were among the forces behind the industry’s growth. Prescription drugs dominate the Indian market,
accounting for 85 percent of India’s pharmaceutical production in 2005. The Indian pharmaceutical
industry accounts for the second largest number of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), is the
world’s leader in Drug Master Files (DMFs) applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
and has the largest number of FDA-approved manufacturing plants (75) outside of the United States.
Many of India’s leading Indian pharmaceutical companies have also been certified by regulatory
authorities in Australia, South Africa, and the EU. 
Imports: India’s consumption of imported pharmaceuticals accounts for only a tiny portion of
the world’s production. Its imports consist almost entirely of life-saving drugs and new generations of
formulations that are under patent by innovator companies. These include anti-cancer, cardiovascular,
and anti-hypertension drugs imported primarily by major global pharmaceutical companies for sale in the
Indian market. Within these categories, leading imports consisted of penicillin (13 percent), antibiotics
for combating stomach infections (9 percent), and other medicines for retail sales in dosage form (19
percent). Life saving drugs can be imported into India duty free, whereas all other pharmaceutical
imports faced a base duty rate of 30 percent and an effective duty rate of 56.8 percent in 2002, compared
with “zero” duty in the United States.  India’s imports of finished pharmaceutical drugs, intermediates,
55
and APIs nearly tripled in value from $516.1 million in 1999 to more than $1.3 billion in 2005 (tables 11
& 12).

India’s top 7 import source countries accounted for approximately 32 percent of the total during
2005, down from 37 percent in 2004 (table 13). India’s leading import suppliers included Switzerland (8
percent), Germany (6 percent), the United States (7 percent), and France (3 percent). Although India’s
pharmaceutical market is relatively small, at least 45 MNC pharmaceutical companies are serving the
market through subsidiaries, other tie-ins, and imports. India’s imports from Switzerland, the United
States, and Germany consisted primarily of other medicaments in dosage form for retail sales (HTS.

Exports: After nearly 30 years of focusing inward, India’s pharmaceutical industry has emerged
as a global player satisfying a significant portion of the world’s generic drug needs. Attracted by high
drug prices in the West, India’s pharmaceutical exports grew from $1.9 million in 1999 to $5.2 billion in
2005 (table 14). In the last 5 years, India’s exports more than doubled and account for approximately 40
percent of total industry production and nearly 30 percent of its revenues. India also enjoyed a trade
surplus that increased from $3.1 billion in 2004 to $3.8 billion in 2005, or by 23 percent. India’s exports
should continue to show strong growth through 2010 as $60 billion worth of patented drugs lose their
patent protection in the United States and Western Europe.  Assocham predicts that Indian companies
56
will capture at least 30 percent of the replacement market of generic drugs.

According to Assocham, the importance of exports has grown dramatically over the last 5 years
due to declining profit margins and the extremely price-competitive nature of the domestic Indian
pharmaceutical market. Exports have grown to constitute a major revenue source for India’s major
pharmaceutical companies including Ranbaxy, Cipla, and Dr. Reddy’s. Collectively, regulated markets
accounted for more than 50 percent of their total annual revenues. In 2005-06, Ranbaxy derived nearly 80
percent of its sales revenues from exports, while exports and international acquisitions accounted for 66
percent of Dr. Reddy’sales and 50 percent of Cipla’s. The successful penetration of the U.S. and EU
markets has encouraged a growing number of Indian “copycat” companies to enter these markets.
India’s exports to the regulated Western markets are expected to remain strong in the mid-term,
event though Indian companies will be challenged by declining prices in the U.S. market, declining profit
margins, growing competition from other low-cost countries, parallel launches of authorized generics by
Western innovator companies, and the increasing power of large distributors in the U.S. and European
markets. About $60 billion in blockbuster drugs will open to generic competition between 2002 and 2010
and Indian companies are expected to vie for a significant percentage of that business.
India exports pharmaceuticals to more than 200 countries and on a country-wise basis, India’s
five largest export markets are the United States (28 percent), Russia (11 percent), Germany (10 percent),
the United Kingdom (8 percent), and China (7 percent) (table 15). All of India’s major pharmaceutical
companies are looking at the global market to accelerate their growth. They are looking at all markets
with potential including the regulated markets of the United States, Japan, and Europe; the semi-
regulated markets of BRIC countries; and less regulated markets of Africa, Middle East, and Southeast
Asia. India has also become a very important source of generic drugs for the developing world and is the
leading supplier of AIDs drugs to the world. Indian companies like Cipla and Ranbaxy have driven the

Other leading exporters include Dr. Reddy’s, Wockhardt, Sun Pharma, and Lupin Labs.
The vast majority of India’s exports, by value, are destined for the developed economies of the
West, particularly the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Exports to these
countries consist primarily of bulk drugs that account for nearly 60 percent of India’s pharmaceutical
exports. The remainder, mostly formulations, are exported to the countries of the former Soviet Union
(CIS) and developing countries (Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America). India continues to be a
leading supplier of less expensive antibiotics, cancer therapy, and AIDs drugs to the developing world. In
2005, more than 90 percent of India’s exports are of drugs that are no longer protected by patents. 
India’s largest single export market continues to be the United States, which is the world’s
largest generic drug market. Exports to the United States grew from $429 million in 2003 to $589 million
in 2005, or by 37 percent. The percentage of total exports represented by the United States declined
slightly from 12 percent in 2003 to 11 percent in 2005. This decline can be attributed to the introduction
of authorized generic drugs by domestic U.S. pharmaceutical giants, lagging profits and declining generic
drug prices, and growing competition from other low-cost countries, particularly Israel, China, Korea,
and those from East Europe.  To offset revenue losses from total sales in the United States during 2005-
58
06, India’s leading exporters have been aggressively shifting their attention to Europe and Africa.
Europe, the world’s third largest pharmaceutical market, behind the United States and Japan, had generic
sales of approximately $100 billion primarily in the UK, Germany, and France. As previously stated,
Indian pharmaceutical companies have made a number of acquisitions in Europe to gain a foothold in its
markets. European generics markets considered to be under served include Spain, Italy, and France, and
are expected to be important and growing markets for Indian exporters in the next 5 years.

One of the preferred methods of penetrating the U.S. market has been by aggressively
challenging the patents on blockbuster drugs. If successful, the challenger can obtain 180-day Exclusive
Marketing Rights (EMR) to sell its generic version before other competitors are allowed into the market.
 “Ranbaxy says it will keep attacking patents,” New York Times, Dec. 21, 2005.
59
 ANDAs were introduced in the Hatch-Waxman Act and are used by foreign generic drug makers to challenge a U.S.
60
patent before its expiry. If successful, the applicant gets a 6-month (180 day) exclusive right to sell its generic version. At the end
that period, other generic drug companies can enter other versions of the molecule and generally the price of the generic version
falls sharply.
 Statistics, Generic Pharmaceutical Association.

For example, Ranbaxy won an EMR against Merck for the production of a generic version of Prozac and
the U.S. FDA permitted Ranbaxy to offer an 80mg generic version of Prozac for 180 days before others
could offer competing generic products. Ranbaxy is also challenging patents on 6 other drugs in the
United States like Valtrex (GSK’s herpes drug), Nexium (AstraZeneca’s anti-ulcer drug), and Actos
(Tekeda’s insulin sensitizer).  Another popular tactic is to file Abbreviated New Drug Applications
59
(ANDAs) with the U.S. FDA.60
On an individual product level, India’ leading exports include other medicaments packaged for
retail sales (HTS subheading 3004), antibiotics, penicillin, and vitamins (table 16). Other medicaments
exports more than tripled during 1999-2005, growing by $614 million to $2.2 billion in 2005. These
products have traditionally dominated India’s exports and their dominance has grown over the years,
from 74 percent of the total in 2003 to approximately 90 percent in 2005. Exports of other medicaments
were dominated by other generic and over-the-counter drugs (HTS 3004.90) that grew from $281 million
in 2002 to $1.4 billion in 2005 representing 62 percent of India’s exports during 2005. This Subheading
includes generic and over the counter drugs such as anti-ulcer and anti-fungal medication, analgesics,
drugs to treat irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) and high blood pressure, anti-infectives, anti-seizure
medication, and antacids and other gastrointestinal drugs.

The role of Indian generic drugs in the U.S. market
Overview: The United States is the world’s largest single market for pharmaceutical products
accounting for nearly 50 percent of the value of the total world market. According to the Generic
Pharmaceutical Association, U.S. retail drug sales for 2006 totaled $221 billion and generic
pharmaceutical sales totaled $54.1 billion.  U.S. pharmaceutical sales grew by 73 percent from $128.1

billion in 2000 (table 17). Together, the United States and Canada account for more than 50 percent of
global sales and U.S. and Canadian generic commodity-type drug sales was estimated at $65 billion in
2005.   
62
In 2005, generic drugs accounted for approximately 63 percent of total U.S.-dispensed
prescriptions and, on average, generic drugs cost between 30 percent and 80 percent less than their
branded counterparts.  On average, the price of a generic commodity type prescriptions was $29.82
63
compared with the average price of brand-name prescription drug at $101.71.  According to the Generic
64
Pharmaceutical Association, the U.S. market for generics grew by 23 percent in 2006 due to a greater
acceptance of generics, changes in U.S. FDA’s generic drug approval process, Medicare Part D, and
declining prices driven by fierce price competition. Generic drug sales are projected to grow by 10 to 12
percent over the next 5 years as more blockbuster drugs lose their patent protection.

U.S. pharmaceutical companies dominate the world’s drug markets. Of the world’s 10 leading
drug companies, five are based in the United States. The top nine U.S. drug manufacturers account for
nearly 70 percent of U.S. drug sales. The leading revenue earners were drugs for the central nervous
system, which generated $53.9 billion, or 21 percent of the total U.S. drug market in 2005.  The second
65
leading category was drugs for the cardiovascular system, which accounted for 19 percent of total U.S.
drug sales, or $496 billion. Pfizer, the U.S. and world’s leading research-based pharmaceutical company,
controlled approximately 11 percent of the world market and 13 percent of the U.S. market in 2005.66
Pfizer’s most important products include Lipitor (the world’s best selling drug) and Norvasc (the world’s
most prescribed anti-hypertension drug). Other leading pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. market are
GSK (UK), Johnson & Johnson, and Merck (table 18).

The U.S. industry producing unbranded commodity-type generic drugs includes 9 of the world’s
10 biggest generic drug companies. Generic drugs cost, on average, between 30 percent and 80 percent of
their brand-name counterparts and account for approximately 56 percent of all prescriptions written in
the United States, yet only 13.6 percent of every dollar spent of pharmaceuticals.  Sales of generic drugs
67
grew by nearly 21 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, as generic versions of innovator blockbuster
drugs lost their patent protection.  The initial six months following the expiry of a patent is the most
68
profitable period for generic drug manufacturers. During that period, the price of the drug only drops, on
average, by 40 percent since only one generic company has been granted exclusive manufacturing rights
under an ANDA by the U.S. FDA.  With the loss of exclusivity after six months, the price drops, on
69
average, an additional 40 percent as more companies enter the market and begin manufacturing the drug.
Nearly $16 billion in patented drugs are scheduled to lose patent protection by the end of 2007.
Leading generic manufacturers in the United States, based on total sales in 2005, included Teva
Pharma-USA, Novartis (Sandoz), Mylan, and Watson (table 19). Leading generic suppliers, based on the
number of prescriptions dispensed, included Teva Pharma-USA, Mylan Labs, Novartis (Sandoz), Watson
Pharma, and Ivax (table 19). Collectively, these companies accounted for more than 62 percent to total
U.S. generic sales and more than 70 percent of all U.S. prescriptions dispensed in 2005. Other leading
generic drug suppliers include Barr Pharma, Perrigo, Fougera, Taro, and Ranbaxy. Ranbaxy reported that
its share of the U.S. generics market increased from 2 percent in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2005 and that the
in markets where it competes, it increased its share of the U.S. market from 12.2 percent in 2004 to 13.9
percent in 2005. In the dermatology segment, Ranbaxy’s share of the market grew from 15.9 percent in
2004 to 21.7 percent in 2005.
Although U.S. generic sales increased in 2005, most of these companies experienced a drop in
revenues resulting from price erosion, the introduction of authorized generics by innovator companies,
and the entry of additional suppliers from low-cost countries into the market. Pricing pressures combined
with mergers & acquisitions and consolidations, have reduced the number of companies manufacturing
generic drugs in the United States over the last 5 years. For example, Teva Pharma-USA, a subsidiary of
Teva Pharmaceuticals (Israel) the world’s largest generic drug producer, became a major player in the
U.S. market with the acquisition of Ivax in 2006 for $7.4 million.  Teva derives over 80 percent of its
70
sales from the United States and Western Europe. Likewise, Actavis Group (Iceland) became a
significant supplier of generic drugs in the U.S. market with the acquisition of Alpharma in 2006. As
companies leave the industry there will be fewer firms producing older generic drugs.

Generic companies are preparing to compete for a share of the more than $60 billion worth of 
anti-cancer drugs set to go off-patent in the United States by 2011. Unlike other markets segments, the
anti-cancer segment has not experienced significant price erosion and companies like Novartis (Sandoz),
Teva Pharma-USA , Pliva, and Mayne Pharma are already offering anti-cancer drugs in the U.S. market.
According to an industry source, while generic versions of most drugs are offered at prices 5 percent to
15 percent of the innovator’s price, anti-cancer drugs will be offered at 40 to 50 percent of the
innovator’s price because only selected companies have the technical and dedicated facilities needed to
produce these drugs.  In September 2006, Dabur Pharma was the first to gain approval from the FDA to
71
offer a generic anti-cancer drug in the U.S. market.  Among the anti-cancer drugs scheduled to lose their
72
patent protection are:

Role of imports in the U.S. market: The United States is the largest single pharmaceutical
market in the world and the prime focus for most exporters. U.S. imports rose 61.5 percent during the
2002-2006 period, from $38.2 billion to $61.7 billion (table 21). In 2005, U.S. pharmaceutical imports
consisted primarily of generic formulations in dosage form, aromatic drugs, antibiotics, vitamins, and
hormones (table 22). Imports of generic drugs have increased in the last 5 years due to cost containment
efforts by healthcare providers, greater acceptance of generic drugs, streamlining of the U.S. FDA’s drug
approval process, the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, and the implementation of Part D of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. Generic drugs
also play an important role in holding down prescription drugs prices by offering the consumer an
identical therapeutic alternative at a significantly lower price. The leading sources for U.S. imports
include Ireland, the UK, France, Japan, and Canada, which collectively account for 51 percent of total
U.S. imports generic drugs in 2006 (table 23). Although India’s exports to the United States have more
than doubled, they accounted for only 1 percent of total U.S. imports in 2006. Imports of other
medicaments in dosage forms and aromatic heterocyclic compounds used as drugs dominated U.S.
exports in 2006 accounting for 78 percent of total imports.

Role of Indian generic drugs on the U.S. market: Indian pharmaceutical companies have
made tremendous strides in the U.S. market. Indian companies are exploiting their cost advantages, their
strength in reverse engineering, and the largest number of U.S. FDA approved plants outside the United
States. Indian companies can manufacture pharmaceuticals for less than half what it costs to manufacture
them in the United States, conduct clinical trials for approximately one-tenth the U.S. cost, and conduct
R&D for less than one-eighth the U.S. cost.  India has more than 75 pharmaceutical plants approved by
73
the U.S. FDA and in 2006, and was very aggressive in filing ANDAs in 2004-06 to challenge patents on
innovator drugs.  Among the drugs that lost U.S. patent protection during 2006 were Pravachol, Zoloft,
74

75
asthma, diabetes, glaucoma, Parkinson’s and thyroid conditions. “Wal-Mart test-markets cheap drugs,” MSNBC, Sept. 22, 2006.

Zocor, Plavix,and Flonase. 
As 30 of the best selling U.S. patent-protected drugs go off patent by 2010, Indian companies are
positioning themselves to offer generic versions of these drugs. Also, nearly $40 billion worth of patent-
protected drugs will become off patent by 2010. Assocham believes that Indian companies will capture at
least 30 percent of the replacement generic equivalents. In 2006, the U.S. FDA approved a Ranbaxy
ANDA application to offer generic versions of 12 formerly patent-protected drugs with annual U.S. sales
of $5.6 billion in 2006. Among these were generic versions of popular drug Zoloft, Valtrex, Zocor,
Cefzil, Ambien, Imodium, and Lasix. Likewise, Dr. Reddy’s received ANDA approval to offer generic
versions of other popular drugs like Zofran, Proscar, and Allegra that have sales of several billion dollars
during 2006-07. 
Competition from Indian and other low-cost countries in the U.S. market will mean cheaper
prices for generic drugs and greater choice for U.S. consumers. Price competition continued to intensify
in the U.S. market thorough 2006 affecting both U.S. and Indian generics manufacturers. Indian
companies compete directly with Teva, Myland, and at least 13 other generic manufacturers in the U.S.
market. Prices and profits were also squeezed by Wal Mart’s announcement that it would offer nearly
300 generic prescription drugs at “sharply-reduced prices,” or at $4 for a month supply, approximately 70
percent savings for consumers.  
75
India comparative advantages have also enabled its API manufacturers to challenge U.S. API
manufacturers for market share and helped Indian companies move up the value-added chain.
Competition between Indian and U.S. manufacturers will also grow as Indian companies acquire U.S.
manufacturing units. Ranbaxy, for example, operates 4 dosage form plants and one subsidiary (OHM
Labs) in the United States with revenues of $426 million, or 36 percent of its total global sales, in 2005.
Others acquiring U.S. facilities include: Zydus Cadila (R&D facility in Atlanta); Dr. Reddy’s
(Trigenesis); Sun Pharma (Able Labs, Caraco, Valeant Pharma); and Jubilant Organosys (Trinity Labs,
Target Research Associates). Indian companies have also entered into a variety of partnerships such as
joint ventures, tie-ins, and alliances with U.S. drug companies. 
Conclusion
India’s pharmaceutical industry has evolved from almost non-existent to a world’s leader in the
production of high-quality, low-cost non-branded or generic drugs, accounting for nearly 20 percent of
the world’s production. India currently produces almost all its own drug needs and domestic companies
control over 80 percent of the Indian market.  It has made tremendous strides over the last two decades as
the Indian domestic market almost doubled in value during 2000 - 2006. Because of low barriers to entry
and low capital requirements, there are tens of thousands of companies producing pharmaceuticals in
India. The vast majority of them are small by Western standards with revenues of less than $5 million. 
With the re-introduction of product patents in 2005 and the fiercely price competitive nature of
the Indian pharmaceutical industry, many smaller, less competitive producers were forced to abandon the
industry as it begins slowly shifting away from vanilla generic drugs to becoming a regional hub for
R&D, drug discovery, contract manufacturing, and technology licensing. In this transition, many mid-
level Indian producers will turn to contract manufacturing, outsourcing, contract research, contract
clinical trials, or other tie-ins with MNCs. Some Indian sources predict that MNCs will make up 60
percent of the Indian market by 2015.76
Since 2005, many MNCs began re-entering the Indian pharmaceutical market by setting up their
28
own manufacturing and R&D facilities. This will gradually neutralize the cost advantages enjoyed by
Indian pharmaceutical majors. These alliances and millions of dollars spent on establishing domestic and
foreign-based manufacturing facilities, acquiring foreign drug manufacturing firms, as well as marketing
and sales networks, will enable India’s leading pharmaceutical producers to re-direct large sums of their
cash flow to R&D and move up the value-added chain. These foreign acquisitions will enable Indian
companies to gain a foothold in Western regulated markets, diversify their portfolios, acquire recognized
brands, and gain R&D capabilities.  
The United States has some of the highest drug prices in the world and has attracted imports of
generic drugs from India and a number of low-cost countries. However, severe price compression and
growing competition from other low-cost countries is forcing Indian majors to offset their losses by
shifting their attention to Western Europe. Nonetheless, Indian companies have made tremendous strides
in the U.S. market and companies like Ranbaxy are major sources of generic drugs. Indian companies
also enjoy comparative advantages in cost, strength in reverse engineering skills, and number of U.S.
FDA approved plants located in India. Indian companies have spent millions of dollars filing ANDAs
with the U.S. FDA to gain exclusive production rights for many drugs losing their patent protection in the
United States. Continued price competition in the U.S. market will mean cheaper prices for generic drugs
and greater choice for U.S. consumers.

Ranbaxy Laboratories 
Ranbaxy Laboratories is India’s largest
pharmaceutical company and one of the world’s
top ten generic drug makers. In 2004 and 2005,
Ranbaxy accounteding for 23 percent of India’s
pharmaceutical industry revenues.  Ranbaxy is a
77
vertically integrated company with a presence in
across the pharmaceutical value chain offering a
range of  unbranded generic and branded
generics, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and
biotechnology products. Ranbaxy markets its
products in more than 100 countries and has
manufacturing facilities in 8 countries and a sales
presence in 23 of the world’s top 25
pharmaceutical markets. 
Most of Ranbaxy’s sales consist of off patent generic drugs and drugs manufactured under
licence from foreign pharmaceutical companies. In 2005, exports accounted for more than 80 percent of
Ranbaxy’s sales and the United States was its largest export market accounting for $328 million, or 28
percent of the total.  Sales in Western Europe amounted to $204 million and BRICS (Brazil, Russia,
78
India, China, South Africa) amounted to $364 million and accounted for 17 percent and 31 percent,
respectively, of the company’s total sales. Many of Ranbaxy’s crucial markets including China, the CIS,
Germany, and South Africa. India registered respectable growth during 2005, whereas the sales in the
United States declined by 25 percent. Ranbaxy reported that its U.S. sales declined because of a steep
erosion in generic drug prices due principally to increased competitive pressures from other Indian
companies and companies from other low-cost countries. Declining U.S. sales combined with increasing
R&D expenditures and litigation related expenses had a significant negative impact on the company’s
profitability in 2005
Ranbaxy entered the U.S. market in 1994 and now ranks among the top 10 suppliers of generic
drugs in the United States. It offers more than 96 different generic products and has increased its share of
the total U.S. generics market from 2.0 percent in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2005. In those segments where
Ranbaxy competes, it increased its share from 12.2 percent in 2004 to 13.9 percent in 2005. In the
branded dermatology segment, Ranbaxy’s share of the market grew from 15.9 percent to 21.7 percent
during 2004-05. Ranbaxy supplements its exports with production from its facilities in Princeton, NJ
(Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) and North Brunswick, NJ (Ohm Labs) and through a partnership with
Invagen Pharmaceuticals (Hauppauge, NY). 
The company is the second largest filer of AND (110 with 59 pending), second only to Teva of
Israel. It is also challenging patents on 7 patented blockbuster drugs whose patents will expire within the
next several years.  In 2006, Ranbaxy won approval from the U.S. FDA to market a number of new
79
products including schizophrenia medication Risperiodone Cetirizine Hydrochloride syrup for seasonal

To expand its global footprint and diversify its product portfolio, Ranbaxy raised $440 million in
March 2006 to finance acquisitions and other capital expenditure requirements. During 2005, it entered
into a number of alliances and other agreements with foreign innovator companies (table 5) and acquired 
11 foreign generic drug manufacturing companies (table A-1). These acquisitions also enabled the
Ranbaxy buy recognized brand names, obtain revenues to fund for its R&D and expansion plans, and to
move up the value-added chain.

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories
Dr. Reddy’s is India’s third largest
pharmaceutical company. It is a vertically
integrated company offering a range of generic
and branded drugs and active pharmaceutical
ingredients. Most of Dr. Reddy’s sales are of
branded drugs reversed engineered versions of
drugs patented in the West. In 2005, branded
drugs accounted for 41 percent of total revenues
and APIs accounted for 34 percent. 
Dr. Reddy’s derives most of its revenues from exports and its international acquisitions that
account for approximately 66 percent of total revenues in 2005-06 and is expected to reach 80 percent by
the end of 2006-07. The company sells and markets its products in more than 100 countries with the
United States accounting for 60 percent of the total.  In 2005-06, the North American market (United
81
States and Canada) accounted for 16 percent of Dr. Reddy’s revenues, Russia and CIS accounted for 15
percent, Europe accounted for 18 percent, and India accounted for 24 percent 
Dr Reddy’s experienced a 3 percent decline in total revenues and a decline in after tax profits of
91 percent in 2004-05 due to declining sales caused by severe pricing pressures on generic drugs in the
United States. Dr. Reddy’s sales in North America declined by 8 percent during this period. During 2005-
06, the company rebounded reporting that revenues increased by 24 percent to $502 million and after-tax
profits grew five fold. The turn around was attributed to stained growth of revenues from APIs,
formulations, generics sales in Europe as well as contributions from Dr. Reddy’s acquisitions in Mexico
and Germany. Dr. Reddy’s is increasingly viewing Western Europe, Japan, Russia and the CIS as a
viable counterbalance to the volatile U.S. market, especially since its in Europe increased by 51 percent
during 2005-06.
 At the product level during 2005-06, formulations accounted for 68 percent of the company’s
revenues during 2004-05 and 69 percent in 2005-06 (table A-2). Dr. Reddy’s reported that sales of APIs
and formulations grew by 19 percent, revenues from branded formulations grew by 27 percent, revenues
from generics grew by 13 percent, revenues from custom pharmaceutical services grew by four fold. In
the medium term, Dr. Reddy’s predicts that its growth will to be driven by the sale of generic drugs in
Western Europe and other more profitable markets.
