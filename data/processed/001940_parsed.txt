Regulation SHO and Rule 10a-1  
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. 
ACTION: Final rule. 
SUMMARY:  The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is amending 
the short sale price test under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  
The amendments are intended to provide a more consistent regulatory environment for 
short selling by removing restrictions on the execution prices of short sales (“price tests” 
or “price test restrictions”), as well as prohibiting any self-regulatory organization 
(“SRO”) from having a price test.  In addition, the Commission is amending Regulation 
SHO to remove the requirement that a broker-dealer mark a sell order of an equity 
security as “short exempt,” if the seller is relying on an exception from a price test.   
DATES:  Effective Date:    July 3, 2007.
Compliance Date:  July 6, 2007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Commission is removing Rule 10a-1 [17 
CFR 240.10a-1], amending Rule 200 of Regulation SHO [17 CFR 242.200], and adding 
Rule 201 of Regulation SHO [17 CFR 242.201] under the Exchange Act.

Introduction 
A. 
Executive Summary 
In December 2006, the Commission proposed amendments to remove the price 
test of Rule 10a-1 and add Rule 201 of Regulation SHO to provide that no price test, 
including any price test of any SRO, shall apply to short sales in any security.1  In 
addition, we proposed to prohibit any SRO from having a price test.2  We also proposed 
to amend Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO to remove the requirement that a broker-dealer 
mark a sell order of an equity security as “short exempt” if the seller is relying on an 
exception from a price test.3
The proposed amendments were designed to modernize and simplify short sale 
regulation and, at the same time, provide greater regulatory consistency by removing 
restrictions where they no longer appear effective or necessary.   
We received twenty-seven comment letters in response to the proposed 
amendments.  Commenters included individual investors, attorneys, an academic, 
individual traders, brokerage firms, the New York Stock Exchange LLC (“NYSE”), the 
International Association of Small Broker-Dealers and Advisors (“IASBDA”), the 
Securities Traders Association (“STA”), the Managed Funds Association (“MFA”), the

Release”).

Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) and the American 
Stock Exchange LLC (“Amex”).  While most commenters supported the Commission’s 
proposals, some expressed concerns regarding particular provisions. 4  We discuss 
specific comments below in connection with the discussion of the amendments. 
After carefully considering the comments, we are adopting the amendments as 
proposed.  In particular, we are removing Rule 10a-1 and adding Rule 201 of Regulation 
SHO to provide that no price test, including any price test by any SRO, shall apply to 
short selling in any security.  In addition, Rule 201, as adopted, will prohibit any SRO 
from having a price test.   
Because we are adopting our proposal to remove all current price test restrictions, 
as well as prohibit any SRO from having its own price test, we are also amending Rule 
200(g) of Regulation SHO5 to remove the requirement that a broker-dealer mark a sell 
order of an equity security as “short exempt” if the seller is relying on an exception from 
the price test of Rule 10a-1, or any price test of any exchange or national securities 
association.6

to the Proposing Release.  We have included a summary of these comment letters in Section IV.  Other

6 These amendments affect price tests and related marking requirements only.  They do not relate to other 
provisions of Regulation SHO.  We note, however, that on June 13, 2007, at an Open Commission 
Meeting, we approved amendments to eliminate the “grandfather” provision of Regulation SHO, and 
proposed amendments to eliminate the options market maker exception of Regulation SHO.  These 
amendments do not alter the amendments to eliminate the grandfather provision, or the proposal to 
eliminate the options market maker exception.

B. 
Background   
The Commission originally adopted Rule 10a-1 in 1938 to restrict short selling in 
a declining market.7  Paragraph (a) of Rule 10a-1 covers short sales in securities 
registered on, or admitted to unlisted trading privileges (“UTP”) on, a national securities 
exchange (“listed securities”), if trades of the security are reported pursuant to an 
“effective transaction reporting plan” and information regarding such trades is made 
available in accordance with such plan on a real-time basis to vendors of market 
transaction information.8  
Rule 10a-1(a)(1) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, a listed security may 
be sold short (A) at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was 
effected (plus tick), or (B) at the last sale price if it is higher than the last different price 
(zero-plus tick).9  Short sales are not permitted on minus ticks or zero-minus ticks, 
subject to narrow exceptions.  The operation of these provisions is commonly described 
as the “tick test.”   
 
The core provisions of Rule 10a-1 have remained virtually unchanged since its 
adoption almost 70 years ago.  Over the years, however, in response to changes in the 
securities markets, including changes in trading strategies and systems used in the 
marketplace, the Commission has added exceptions to Rule 10a-1 and granted numerous 
                                                 
7 See Exchange Act Release No. 1548 (Jan. 24, 1938), 3 FR 213 (Jan. 26, 1938). 
 
8 Rule 10a-1 uses the term "effective transaction reporting plan" as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS 
(17 CFR 242.600) under the Exchange Act.  See 17 CFR 240.10a-1(a)(1)(i). 
 
9 The last sale price is the price reported pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan, i.e., the 
consolidated tape, or to the last sale price reported in a particular marketplace.  Under Rule 10a-1, the 
Commission gives market centers the choice of measuring the tick of the last trade based on executions 
solely on their own exchange rather than those reported to the consolidated tape.  See 17 CFR 240.10a-
1(a)(2).

written requests for relief from the rule’s restrictions.10  These requests for exemptive 
relief have increased dramatically in recent years in response to significant developments 
in the securities markets, such as the increased use of matching systems that execute 
trades at independently derived prices during random times within specific time intervals 
and the spread of fully automated markets.  Also, decimal pricing increments have 
substantially reduced the difficulty of short selling on an uptick.  In addition, under 
current price test regulation, different price tests apply to different securities trading in 
different markets and apply generally only to large or more actively-traded securities.11   
In 2004, we adopted Rule 202T of Regulation SHO,12 which established 
procedures for the Commission to temporarily suspend price tests so that the Commission 
could study the effectiveness of these tests.13  Pursuant to the process established in Rule 
202T of Regulation SHO, we issued an order (“First Pilot Order”) creating a one year 
                                                 
10 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75071-75072 (discussing exceptions to Rule 10a-1 added by the 
Commission and relief granted by the Commission from the rule’s restrictions in recent years). 
 
11 Rule 10a-1’s tick test is based on the last reported sale and applies to securities listed on a national 
securities exchange.  The NASD’s and Nasdaq’s bid tests are based on the last bid rather than the last 
reported sale and apply only to short sales in Nasdaq Global Market securities.  See NASD Rule 5100, 
available at 
http://nasd.complinet.com/nasd/display/display.html?rbid=1189&record_id=1159007939&element_id=115
9006014&highlight=5100#r1159007939; Nasdaq Rule 3350, available at 
http://nasdaq.complinet.com/nasdaq/display/display.html? rbid=1705&element_id=16.  Thus, under the 
current market structure, Nasdaq Global Market securities traded on Nasdaq or the over-the-counter 
(“OTC”) market and reported to an NASD facility are subject to Nasdaq’s or the NASD’s bid tests; other 
listed securities traded on an exchange, or otherwise, are subject to Rule 10a-1’s tick test.  Nasdaq-listed 
securities traded on exchanges other than Nasdaq are not subject to any short sale price test restrictions.  In 
addition, smaller and more thinly-traded securities, such as Nasdaq Capital Market securities and securities 
quoted on the OTC bulletin board (“OTCBB”) and pink sheets, are not subject to any price test restrictions 
wherever traded.

pilot (“Pilot”) temporarily suspending the provisions of Rule 10a-1(a) and any price test 
of any exchange or national securities association for short sales of certain securities.14   
The Pilot was designed to assist the Commission in assessing whether changes to 
current short sale regulation are necessary in light of current market practices and the 
purposes underlying short sale regulation.15  The Commission stated in the Regulation 
SHO Adopting Release that conducting a pilot pursuant to Rule 202T would “allow us to 
obtain data on the impact of short selling in the absence of a price test to assist in 
determining, among other things, the extent to which a price test is necessary to further 
the objectives of short sale regulation, to study the effects of relatively unrestricted short 
selling on market volatility, price efficiency, and liquidity, and to obtain empirical data to 
help assess whether a price test should be removed, in part or in whole, for some or all 
securities, or if retained, should be applied to additional securities.”16  As noted in the 
Regulation SHO Adopting Release, the empirical data from the Pilot was to be obtained 
and analyzed “as part of [the Commission’s] assessment as to whether the price test 
                                                 
14 Exchange Act Release No. 50104 (July 28, 2004), 69 FR 48032 (Aug. 6, 2004).  Specifically, the First 
Pilot Order suspended price tests for: (1) short sales in the securities identified in Appendix A to the First 
Pilot Order; (2) short sales in the securities included in the Russell 1000 index effected between 4:15 p.m. 
EST and the open of the consolidated tape on the following day; and (3) short sales in any security not 
included in paragraphs (1) and (2) effected in the period between the close of the consolidated tape and the 
open of the consolidated tape on the following day.  In addition, the First Pilot Order provided that the Pilot 
would commence on January 3, 2005 and terminate on December 31, 2005, and that the Commission might 
issue further orders affecting the operation of the First Pilot Order.  Id. at 48033.  On November 29, 2004, 
we issued an order resetting the Pilot to commence on May 2, 2005 and end on April 28, 2006 to give 
market participants additional time to make systems changes necessary to comply with the Pilot.  Exchange 
Act Release No. 50747 (Nov. 29, 2004), 69 FR 70480 (Dec. 6, 2004).  On April 20, 2006, we issued an 
order (“Third Pilot Order”) extending the termination date of the Pilot to August 6, 2007, the date on which 
temporary Rule 202T of Regulation SHO expires.  Exchange Act Release No. 53684 (April 20, 2006), 71 
FR 24765 (April 26, 2006).  The purpose of the Third Pilot Order was to maintain the status quo with 
regard to price tests for Pilot securities while the staff completed its analysis of the Pilot data and the 
Commission conducted any additional short sale rulemaking.

should be removed or modified, in part or whole, for actively-traded securities or other 
securities.”17   
Thus, the Commission’s Office of Economic Analysis (“OEA”) gathered the data 
made public during the Pilot, analyzed this data and provided the Commission with a 
summary report on the Pilot.18  The OEA Staff’s Summary Pilot Report examined several 
aspects of market quality including the overall effect of price tests on short selling, 
liquidity, volatility and price efficiency.  The Pilot data was also designed to allow the 
Commission and members of the public to examine whether the effects of price tests are 
similar across stocks.19   
In addition, the Commission encouraged outside researchers to examine the Pilot.  
In response to this request, the Commission received four completed studies (the 
                                                 
17 Id. at 69 FR at 48013.  In the Regulation SHO Adopting Release we noted that “the purpose of the [P]ilot 
is to assist the Commission in considering alternatives, such as:  (1) Eliminating a Commission-mandated 
price test for an appropriate group of securities, which may be all securities; (2) adopting a uniform bid test, 
and any exceptions, with the possibility of extending a uniform bid test to securities for which there is 
currently no price test; or (3) leaving in place the current price tests.”  Id. at 69 FR at 48010.

Prior to the publication of the Proposing Release, OEA made available on the Commission’s Internet Web 
site, the OEA Staff’s Draft Summary Pilot Report.  The conclusions reached in the OEA Staff’s Summary 
Pilot Report do not differ from those in the OEA Staff’s Draft Summary Pilot Report. 
 
19 In the Regulation SHO Adopting Release, the Commission stated its expectation that data on trading 
during the Pilot would be made available to the public to encourage independent researchers to study the 
Pilot.  See Regulation SHO Adopting Release, 69 FR at 48009, n.9.  Accordingly, nine SROs began 
publicly releasing transactional short selling data on January 3, 2005.  The nine SROs were the AMEX, 
ARCA, BSE, CHX, NASD, Nasdaq, National Stock Exchange, NYSE and Phlx.  The SROs agreed to 
collect and make publicly available trading data on each executed short sale involving equity securities 
reported by the SRO to a securities information processor.  The SROs publish the information on a monthly 
basis on their Internet Web sites.

“Academic Studies”) from outside researchers that specifically examine the Pilot data.20  
The Commission also held a public roundtable (the “Regulation SHO Roundtable”) that 
focused on the empirical evidence learned from the Pilot data (the OEA Staff’s Draft 
Summary Pilot Report, Academic Studies, and Regulation SHO Roundtable are referred 
to collectively herein as, the “Pilot Results”).21  The Pilot Results contained a variety of 
observations, which we considered in determining whether or not to propose removal of 
current price test restrictions and whether to adopt the amendments today.  Generally, the 
Pilot Results supported removal of current price test restrictions.22    
 
Based on our review of the Pilot Results and of the status of current price test 
restrictions, we proposed to remove Rule 10a-1 and add Rule 201 of Regulation SHO to 
provide that no price test, including any price test of any SRO, shall apply to short sales 
in any security.  Rule 201 would also prohibit any SRO from having a price test.  In 
addition, because we proposed to remove all current price test restrictions, and prohibit 
any price test by any SRO, we proposed to amend Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO to 
remove the requirement that a broker-dealer mark a sell order of an equity security as 
“short exempt” if the seller is relying on an exception from the price test of Rule 10a-1, 
or any price test of any exchange or national securities association.

Removal of Price Test Restrictions 
We proposed to remove Rule 10a-1 and add Rule 201 of Regulation SHO to 
provide that no price test, including any price test of any SRO, shall apply to short sales 
in any security.  In addition, we proposed to prohibit any SRO from having a price test.  
We are adopting the amendments, as proposed. 
A. 
Comments Summary 
The comments on the proposed amendments varied.  Most commenters (including 
individual traders, academics, broker-dealers, MFA, STA, NYSE, and SIFMA) 
advocated removing all price test restrictions.23  These commenters believe that price test 
restrictions are no longer necessary in today’s markets, which are more transparent and 
where there is real-time regulatory surveillance that can easily monitor for and detect any 
short sale manipulation.24  In addition, these commenters noted that market 
developments, such as technological innovations and decimalization, have transformed 
the trading landscape since Rule 10a-1 was first adopted and has changed the impact of 
price test restrictions.25

In supporting the proposal, one commenter expressed its view that “short selling 
enhances market liquidity and contributes to stock pricing efficiency, and thus is an 
important part of our securities markets, and that the existing restrictions on the execution 
prices of short sales . . . inhibit the free-market price discovery mechanism of an efficient 
market.”26  In addition, this commenter noted the significant financial, technology and 
human resources it expends on ensuring compliance with price test restrictions.27  This 
commenter believes that the compliance costs and loss of market benefits created by 
short sales (such as, added liquidity and price efficiency) outweigh any potential or 
theoretical regulatory benefits of price tests.28   
In expressing its support for prohibiting SROs from having their own price tests, 
SIFMA noted that without this prohibition SROs “could feel pressured to maintain a 
price test as a marketing tool for attracting issuer listings.  This would lead to an 
environment, as exists today, where there would be disparate price tests, or even no price 
test, depending on the market on which a security trades.  Such a result imposes 
unnecessary compliance costs upon broker-dealers (without also providing real benefits 
to investors) and leads to regulatory arbitrage.”29   
                                                 
26 E*TRADE Letter, supra note 23.  See also, MFA Letter, supra note 23 (stating that the MFA regards 
short selling as an essential method by which investors, including fiduciaries managing others’ assets, can 
manage risk, hedge their portfolios, and reflect their view that the current market price of a security is 
higher than it should be). 
 
27 See E*TRADE Letter, supra note 23. 
 
28 See id.  See also, UBS Letter, supra note 23 (noting that there are substantial programming, 
implementation, and ongoing compliance costs associated with maintaining price test restrictions). 
 
29 SIFMA Letter, supra note 23.  See also, E*TRADE Letter, supra note 23 (commenting that allowing 
SROs to have their own price tests would increase compliance and systems change costs to market 
participants, including broker-dealers executing customer short sales).  In addition, in its letter, SIFMA 
commented that allowing SROs to have their own price tests could raise best execution concerns for 
broker-dealers determining how best to route short sale orders, i.e., in that a broker-dealer would need to 
 
10
 
 
Similarly, the STA commented that eliminating price test restrictions and 
prohibiting SROs from implementing the same would eliminate regulatory arbitrage in 
short sale regulation and would allow marketplaces to compete with each other on the 
basis of execution quality, rather than on regulatory disparities, which it believes, would 
increase public investor confidence in the markets.30  The NYSE stated its belief that all 
equity markets should be regulated equally, noting that “[i]t is inappropriate that the 
federal securities laws, through the application of Rule 10a-1, requires trading of NYSE-
listed securities to be held to a different standard than those listed on other markets.”31  
The NYSE further noted that it believes the “practical effect of the proposed amendments 
will be to level the playing field in the area of short sales and establish a more consistent 
and uniform regulatory regime across all markets.”32
Two commenters (both individual investors) opposed the proposed amendments 
noting the need for price tests to prevent “bear raids.”33  Other commenters (including 
individual traders and E*Trade), however, noted that sharp market declines, such as those 
induced by “bear raids,” are highly unlikely to occur in today’s markets which are 
                                                                                                                                                 
consider whether to route short sale orders received to a market that has a price test, as opposed to a market 
which does not and which could thus perhaps provide a faster execution.  See SIFMA Letter, supra note 23.

33 See, e.g., letter from Jim Ferguson (Dec. 19, 2006); letters from David Patch (Jan. 1, 2007; Jan. 12, 2007) 
(“Patch Letters”).  A “bear raid” involves the active selling of a security short to drive down the security’s 
price in the hopes of convincing less informed investors of a negative material perception of the security, 
triggering sell orders.  Falling prices could trigger margin calls and possibly forced liquidations of the 
security, depressing the price further.  This unrestricted short selling could exacerbate a declining market in 
a security by eliminating bids, and causing a further reduction in the price of a security by creating an 
appearance that the security’s price is falling for fundamental reasons.  At the time, many people blamed 
“bear raids” for the 1929 stock market crash and the market’s prolonged inability to recover from the crash.

characterized by much smaller spreads, higher liquidity, and greater transparency than 
when the rule was adopted almost 70 years ago.34
One commenter, although generally in support of removing all price test 
restrictions, believes that at some level unrestricted short selling should be collared.35  
This commenter supported having a 10% circuit breaker to prevent panic in the event 
there is a major market collapse.36  The NYSE also noted its concern about unrestricted 
short selling during periods of unusually rapid and large market declines.  This 
commenter stated that the effects of an unusually rapid and large market decline could 
not be measured or analyzed during the Pilot because such decline did not occur during 
the period studied.  Accordingly, the NYSE commented that it believes SROs should be 
permitted to propose rules to be applied in such situations should they deem it 
appropriate.37  
As an alternative to removing all price test restrictions, one commenter suggested 
extending the Pilot to include more securities to better evaluate the benefits of completely 
eliminating current price test restrictions.38  Another commenter, the IASBDA, noted that 
while it believes that the staff makes a compelling case for the removal of price test 
                                                 
34 See, e.g., E*Trade Letter, supra note 23; Giannone Letter, supra note 23; Schwarz Letter, supra note 23.  
In addition, we note that panelists at the Regulation SHO Roundtable stated the belief that price test

any index arbitrage order to sell any component stock of the S&P 500 Stock Price IndexSM with the

restrictions for the Russell 3000 securities, it fails to address whether the issuers of other 
securities should have some choice in whether they want their stock subject to a price 
test.39  IASBDA commented that “[b]y insisting that it must be all or none the staff may 
unnecessarily force small issuers to accept an environment which is most unkind to their 
securities.”40  Furthermore, IASBDA criticized the Pilot for not including OTCBB stocks 
and other small stocks.41  This commenter noted that “[t]he Russell 3000 is a broad based 
index in terms of capitalization but there are roughly 9000 stocks in the publicly reporting 
universe.  The Russell 3000 Index offers investors access to the broad U.S. equity 
universe representing approximately 98% of the U.S. market, but roughly 33% of 
individual stocks.  The SEC’s Advisory Committee Report on Small Public Companies 
Final report concluded there were 9,428 companies listed including the otcbb.  Report at 
p.5.”42  Thus, IASBDA stated that there may be an argument for phasing in the 
elimination by starting with the larger stocks and concluding with the OTCBB and 
smaller segments of the market.  IASBDA suggested that this methodology might allow 
the Commission to learn something from its observance of the large stocks without a tick 
test.43

Similarly, Amex believes that it is premature to remove price tests from smaller 
securities pending further analysis.44  In its comment letter, Amex stated that it has 
“noted numerous statements in the Proposing Release, the OEA Staff’s Draft Summary 
Pilot Report, and the Roundtable Transcript that suggest that the impact of eliminating 
short sale price tests may differ between large capitalization and small capitalization 
securities.  Such a differential impact would obviously be of great concern to the Amex, 
which has a large concentration of small capitalization issuers.”45  Thus, Amex 
commented that while it is not suggesting that price test restrictions be extended to 
additional securities, nor is it adamantly opposing the ultimate removal of price test 
restrictions from small capitalization securities to which price tests currently apply, it is 
advocating additional study before such action is taken in connection with small 
capitalization securities.46   
We noted in the Proposing Release that in connection with the Pilot, nine 
reporting markets have been making public information about short selling transactions,47  
and we requested comment regarding whether it would be in the public interest to request 
that markets continue to release this information.48  In response, the NYSE expressed its

the markets to continue to release such information would improve transparency of short selling.  In 
addition, we asked whether it would help the Commission monitor the markets for potential abuses if the 
Commission were to approve the removal of price tests.  We also asked for comment regarding how costly

objection to the Commission continuing to require the markets to collect and make this 
information publicly available, noting that collecting and producing such information has 
proven to be costly and time-consuming.49  The MFA commented that it believes such 
information should only be made available to law enforcement authorities.50  Another 
commenter, however, urged the Commission to work with the SROs to ensure that data 
similar to that made publicly available during the Pilot, continues to be available to 
researchers after the Pilot.51   
In its letter, the NYSE stated that it believes that “the stated purpose for publicly 
releasing such data during the pilot – i.e., encouraging independent researchers to study 
the pilot’s effects – has already been successfully accomplished, as evidenced by the 
academic studies published and public roundtable held concerning the results of the pilot 
data.”52  The NYSE also did not believe that we should request that the SROs submit 
periodic reports regarding the effects of the removal of price test restrictions at regular 
intervals, such as on a semi-annual or annual basis, stating that such a requirement, in 
addition to collecting and making publicly available data on short sale transactions, 
would “greatly exacerbate costs.”53

We have carefully considered all the comments we received regarding the 
proposed amendments.  In particular, we note the comments regarding the need for price 
test restrictions to prevent the use of short selling to drive down the market in “bear 
raids.”  One of the Commission’s stated objectives when it adopted Rule 10a-1 in 1938 
was to prevent short sellers from accelerating a declining market by exhausting all 
remaining bids at one price level, causing successively lower prices to be established by 
long sellers.54  In addition, in the Proposing Release, we noted that although short selling 
serves useful market purposes, such as increasing market liquidity and price efficiency, it 
also may be used to illegally manipulate stock prices.55  Because of the Commission’s 
stated objective when it adopted Rule 10a-1 and our concerns about the potential use of 
short sales to manipulate stock prices, OEA examined the Pilot data for any indication 
that there is an association between extreme price movements and price test restrictions.  
OEA, however, did not find any such association.56  We also note that although we are 
removing current price test restrictions, today’s markets are characterized by high levels 
of transparency and regulatory surveillance.  These characteristics greatly reduce the risk 
of undetected manipulation and permit regulators to monitor for the types of activities 
that current price test restrictions are designed to prevent.  In addition, we note that the 
general anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws continue 
to prohibit activity designed to improperly influence the price of a security.57

In addition, with respect to comments regarding the Commission allowing SROs 
to adopt price test restrictions in the event of unusually rapid and large market declines, 
we have determined not to take such action at this time.58  We believe that allowing 
SROs to adopt price test restrictions under such circumstances could undermine a 
primary objective of the proposed amendments of achieving regulatory uniformity and 
simplicity.59  For the same reasons, we do not believe that we should implement a circuit 
breaker for short sales at this time.   
We note, however, that pursuant to Section 36 of the Exchange Act, in the future 
the Commission could determine that circumstances have arisen that justify the issuance 
of an exemption from the provisions of Rule 201.60  Should an SRO request the 
Commission issue such an exemption in conjunction with the filing of an SRO proposed 
rule change to establish a price test restriction, when considering any such request, the 
Commission would consider, among other things, whether the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the objectives of today’s amendments of providing regulatory simplicity 
and consistency.  In addition, to issue an exemption pursuant to Section 36, the 
                                                 
58 See NYSE Letter, supra note 23.   
 
59 We note, however, that Section 12(k)(2) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission, “in an 
emergency, may by order summarily take such action to alter, supplement, suspend, or impose 
requirements or restrictions with respect to any matter or action subject to regulation by the Commission or 
a self-regulatory organization under the securities laws, as the Commission determines is necessary in the 
public interest and for the protection of investors (i) to maintain or restore fair and orderly securities 
markets (other than markets in exempted securities); (ii) to ensure prompt, accurate, and safe clearance and 
settlement of transactions in securities (other than exempted securities); or (iii) to reduce, eliminate, or 
prevent the substantial disruption by the emergency of (I) securities markets (other than markets in 
exempted securities), investment companies, or any other significant portion or segment of such markets, or 
(II) the transmission or processing of securities transactions (other than transactions in exempted 
securities).”  In addition, SROs may also continue to have rules consistent with the concept of circuit 
breakers.   
 
60 See 15 U.S.C. 78mm.   
 
 
17
 
 
Commission would have to find that such an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors.61
In response to IASBDA’s comment regarding allowing issuers to have a choice as 
to whether or not they want their stock to be subject to a price test, we have determined 
not to take such action at this time.  A primary goal of the amendments is to bring 
uniformity to, and simplify, short sale regulation.  To allow issuers to have a choice as to 
whether or not their stock is subject to a price test would undermine this primary 
objective.  In addition, we note that in the Proposing Release we specifically requested 
comment from issuers regarding their views of the impact of the proposed amendments 
on their securities.62  We did not, however, receive any comments from issuers.63   
In addition, with respect to IASBDA’s comment regarding the universe of 
securities subject to the Pilot and, in particular, that the Pilot did not include securities 
quoted on the OTCBB, we note that the Pilot did not include this class of securities 
because securities quoted on the OTCBB are not currently subject to any price test 
restrictions. 
Both the IASBDA and Amex suggested removing price tests from larger 
securities first to allow time to study the impact of the permanent removal of price test 
restrictions before such action is taken for smaller securities.  We do not believe that such 
                                                 
61 See id.
 
62 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75076. 
 
63 We note that the IASBDA is an advocacy group for small broker-dealers and advisers (including lawyers 
and hedge funds). 
 
 
18
 
 
an approach would provide new results relevant to smaller securities. 64  As we noted in 
the Proposing Release, while there is some evidence supporting the application of price 
test restrictions to smaller securities, the evidence is not strong enough to warrant the 
continuation of current price test restrictions to any subset of securities.65  Such 
continuation would also undermine a primary goal of these amendments of providing 
greater uniformity and simplicity to short sale regulation. 
In connection with whether we should request that SROs continue to make public 
information regarding short sale transactions similar to that obtained during the Pilot, we 
note that the SROs have provided such information during the Pilot at our request so that 
researchers could provide the Commission with their own empirical analyses of the 
Pilot.66  We have determined at this time not to propose to require the SROs to make 
information similar to that obtained during the Pilot publicly available on a regular basis. 
With respect to whether the SROs should submit periodic reports regarding the 
effects of the removal of price tests, and in response to commenters concerns that traders 
may have been on “good behavior” during the Pilot, 67 we note that while we believe that 
                                                 
64 See IASBDA Letter, supra note 39; Amex Letter, supra note 44.  We note that many smaller or thinly-
traded securities, such as Nasdaq Capital Market securities and securities quoted on the OTCBB and pink 
sheets, are not currently subject to any price test restrictions. 
 
65 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75076.  In addition, we note that academics have previously examined 
short selling in a matched sample of Nasdaq National Market stocks, which were subject to price test 
restrictions, and Nasdaq SmallCap stocks, which were not, during a period of high volatility and rapidly 
declining stock prices (September 2000 to August 2001).  In this study’s sample of 2,275 observations, the 
study found no significant differences in the overall level of short selling, or the frequency of days with 
abnormally negative returns and abnormally high short selling.  See Michael G. Ferri, Stephen E. 
Christophe, and James J. Angel, A short look at bear raids: Testing the bid test, 2004. 
 
66 See Regulation SHO Adopting Release, 69 FR at 48009. 
 
67 For example, in its letter, Amex noted a comment by OEA in the OEA Staff’s Draft Summary Pilot 
Report that it is possible that traders might behave differently if a rule were permanently and completely 
removed than if it is only temporarily and incompletely removed, and that traders with manipulative 
intentions might be on good behavior if they believe that heightened scrutiny during the Pilot increases 
their chances of getting caught.  See Amex Letter, supra note 44. 
 
19
 
 
current price test restrictions are no longer effective or necessary, we intend to closely 
monitor for potentially abusive trading activities.  We expect that the markets will 
similarly continue to surveil for trading abuses.  To the extent we obtain evidence of 
possible violations of the federal securities laws, we will pursue investigations and law 
enforcement actions as warranted. 
We have carefully considered the comments and continue to believe that the 
amendments are appropriate in light of market developments that have occurred in the 
securities industry since the Commission adopted Rule 10a-1 in 1938, such as 
decimalization, the increased use of matching systems that execute trades at 
independently derived prices during random times within specific time intervals, and, 
most recently, the spread of fully automated markets.  We believe the amendments will 
bring increased uniformity to short sale regulation, level the playing field for market 
participants, and remove an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. 
In addition, we note that only one commenter questioned the economic evidence 
supporting the amendments, but we believe that the critique is inapplicable.68  The Pilot 
was designed to assist the Commission in assessing whether changes to current short sale 
regulation are necessary in light of current market practices and the purposes underlying 
                                                                                                                                                 
 
68 One commenter expressed concern about the methodologies used in the Pilot studies.  See Patch Letters, 
supra note 33 (stating that “the methods in which the OEA conducted their analysis (specifically the 
duration of time) is flawed.  Bear raids do not last for months but over days or weeks and such analysis by 
the OEA, looking over large windows of time without looking at micro trading, is a flawed approach”).  
But see, OEA Staff’s Summary Pilot Report at 9, supra note 18 (stating that OEA focused its investigation 
on price patterns that might indicate manipulative behavior at a daily or intraday frequency).  In addition, 
we note that panelists from the Regulation SHO Roundtable were asked to critique the studies and all 
panelists generally agreed with the results.  See Roundtable Transcript at 49-57, 72-80, supra note 21.

price test regulation.69  During the comment period, we received one additional study 
examining the results of the Pilot.70  This study found results that are consistent with 
other Pilot studies previously submitted to, and discussed by, the Commission, which 
generally found that current price test restrictions do not enhance market quality.71   
Thus, after carefully considering the comments received, we are adopting the 
amendments, as proposed.   
III. 
Removal of “Short Exempt” Marking Requirement 
Because we proposed to remove Rule 10a-1 and prohibit any SRO from having a 
price test, we also proposed to amend Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO72 to remove the 
requirement that a broker-dealer mark a sell order of an equity security as “short exempt” 
if the seller is relying on an exception from the tick test of Rule 10a-1, or any price test of 
any exchange or national securities association.73  We are adopting the amendment as 
proposed. 
Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO provides that a broker-dealer must mark all sell 
orders of any security as “long,” “short,” or “short exempt.”74  Further, Rule 200(g)(2) of 
Regulation SHO provides that a short sale order must be marked “short exempt” if the 
seller is “relying on an exception from the tick test of 17 CFR 240.10a-1, or any short

and the Pilot Results).

note 20.  See also, Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75072-75075 (discussing the Pilot Results).   
 
72 17 CFR 242.200(g). 
 
73 Broker-dealers would, however, continue to be required to mark sell orders as either “long” or “short” in 
compliance with Rule 200(g).

sale price test of any exchange or national securities association.”75  The “short exempt” 
marking requirement provides a record that short sellers are availing themselves of the 
various exceptions to, or exemptions from, the application of the restrictions of Rule 10a-
1 or of any price test of any exchange or national securities association.  
A. 
Comments Summary 
  
We received five comment letters, from the MFA, STA, UBS, NYSE, and 
SIFMA in response to the proposed amendment.76  Generally, the commenters supported 
the Commission’s proposal to remove the “short exempt” marking requirement.77
Although the STA stated that it supports the proposal to remove the “short 
exempt” marking requirement in Regulation SHO, the STA commented that it believes 
that securities currently marked “short exempt” pursuant to Rule 203(b)(2)(ii) of 
Regulation SHO78 should be marked “long” rather than “short” because marking such 
orders “short” “does not accurately describe the customer’s ownership of the same and 
                                                 
75 See id. at 242.200(g)(2). 
 
76 See MFA Letter, supra note 23; STA Letter, supra note 23; UBS Letter, supra note 23; NYSE Letter, 
supra note 23; SIFMA Letter, supra note 23. 
 
77 See MFA Letter, supra note 23; STA Letter, supra note 23; UBS Letter, supra note 23.  In its letter, the 
MFA noted that it believes broker-dealers are in the best position to raise compliance issues related to their 
systems and the “short exempt” marking requirement.  Thus, the MFA urged the Commission to carefully 
consider any compliance concerns raised by broker-dealers in considering this proposal.  See MFA Letter, 
supra note 23. 
 
78 17 CFR 242.203(b)(2)(ii).  Rule 203(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation SHO excepts from the locate requirement of 
Regulation SHO any sale of a security that a person is deemed to own pursuant to Rule 200 of Regulation 
SHO, provided that the broker-dealer has been reasonably informed that the person intends to deliver such 
security as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed.  If the person has not delivered such 
security within 35 days after the trade date, the broker-dealer that effected the sale must borrow securities 
or close out the short position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  Such circumstances could 
include the situation where a convertible security, option, or warrant has been tendered for conversion or 
exchange, but the underlying security is not reasonably expected to be received by settlement date.  
Another situation could be where a customer owns stock that was formerly restricted, but pursuant to Rule 
144 under the Securities Act of 1933, the security may be sold without restriction.  In connection with the 
sale of such security, the security may not be capable of being delivered on settlement date due to 
processing to remove the restricted legend.

could cause confusion and anger from public investors when they receive confirmation of 
the sale of a security they understood they owned.”79  Similarly, SIFMA commented that 
its member firms would encourage the Commission to amend the definition of a “long” 
sale to include these types of sales “to avoid unintended consequences and mistaken 
perceptions by issuers and others as to the nature of the sale.”80   
In addition, SIFMA commented that rather than removing the “short exempt” 
marking requirement, SIFMA firms generally would prefer that the Commission preserve 
the “short exempt” marking requirement, specifically amending Regulation SHO to 
indicate that a sale should be marked “short exempt” if effected in reliance on an 
exception from the “locate” requirement, pursuant to Rule 203(b)(2) of Regulation 
SHO.81  According to SIFMA, firms “generally are of the view that preserving “short 
exempt” marking for such situations should assist their compliance efforts by identifying 
short sales for which a locate is not required to be obtained.”82
                                                 
79 STA Letter, supra note 23. 
80 SIFMA Letter, supra note 23. 
 
81 Id.  Rule 203(b)(2) provides an exception from the locate requirement of Rule 203(b)(1) for:  “(i) A 
broker or dealer that has accepted a short sale order from another registered broker or dealer that is required 
to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless the broker or dealer relying on this exception 
contractually undertook responsibility for compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section; (ii) Any sale of 
a security that a person is deemed to own pursuant to §242.200, provided that the broker or dealer has been 
reasonably informed that the person intends to deliver such security as soon as all restrictions on delivery 
have been removed.  If the person has not delivered such security within 35 days after the trade date, the 
broker-dealer that effected the sale must borrow securities or close out the short position by purchasing 
securities of like kind and quantity; (iii) Short sales effected by a market maker in connection with bona-
fide market making activities in the security for which this exception is claimed; and (iv) Transactions in 
security futures.” 
 
82 SIFMA Letter, supra note 23.  SIFMA noted in its letter that, if the Commission decides not to amend the 
definition of a “long” sale in Rule 200(g) as suggested by SIFMA, it would strongly urge the Commission 
to continue to allow firms to mark sales “short exempt,” in reliance on the exception from the Regulation 
SHO “locate” requirement in Rule 203(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation SHO.  Id.  UBS also commented that we 
should retain the “short exempt” marking requirement to “identify certain short sale transactions as exempt 
from the affirmative determination requirements for regulatory and compliance requirements.”  UBS 
Letter, supra note 23.

The MFA and NYSE responded to our request for comment in the Proposing 
Release regarding whether, in the absence of price test restrictions, the marking of sell 
orders would continue to need to be transparent to market makers and specialists.83  
Currently, to facilitate the application of price test restrictions, market makers and 
specialists receive information allowing them to distinguish short sales from other sales.   
In its comment letter, the MFA stated that “[i]n protecting the confidentiality of 
customer orders and maintaining a level playing field for all market participants, MFA 
supports the idea of availing order marking information only to brokers preparing order 
tickets.”84  The MFA believes that the “best safeguard for maintaining the integrity of 
order information is by limiting order marking information to those necessary in carrying 
out compliance functions.”85   
NYSE, on the other hand, expressed its belief that it is “necessary that the overall 
short interest in a security, as well as information on whether a particular sell order 
introduced to the Exchange is long or short, continue to be transparent intra-day to 
specialists in the securities in which they are registered.”86  NYSE noted that “[f]or a 
specialist, making the correct determination regarding the necessity of a dealer 
transaction at any given moment includes an understanding of the general market 
                                                 
83 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75078.  Specifically, in the Proposing Release we stated that:  “To 
facilitate the application of Rule 10a-1, NASD Rule 5100, and Nasdaq Rule 3350, market makers and 
specialists receive information allowing them to distinguish short sales from other sales.  In other words, 
the information on whether an order is marked “long,” “short,” or “short exempt” is made transparent to 
market makers and specialists but not to other market participants or the public.  In the absence of price test 
restrictions, would the marking of sell orders need to be transparent to market makers and specialists?  
Would there be any systems or market quality costs/benefits associated with not revealing this information 
to specialists and market makers?”

conditions in a particular security, including the actual or reasonably anticipated needs of 
the market.  The intra-day short interest position in a security as well as whether 
particular orders are long or short are critical pieces of information in the overall mix of 
factors that combine to form the “market” in that security.”87  The NYSE believes that 
the absence of such information would result in poorer overall market quality.88
 
B. 
Response to Comments 
We have carefully considered all the comments we received.  In response to the 
STA’s and SIFMA’s comments regarding revising the definition of when an order should 
be marked “long” to include sales of securities excepted from the locate requirement 
pursuant to Rule 203(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation SHO, we have determined not to take such 
action at this time.  Although these are sales of securities that a person is “deemed to 
own” pursuant to Rule 200 of Regulation SHO,89 the securities will not be delivered in 
time for settlement of the transaction and, therefore, we believe that such sales are more 
appropriately marked as “short” rather than “long” sales.90   
In addition, in response to STA’s comment that the marking of these orders as 
“short” does not accurately describe the customer’s ownership of the same and could 
cause confusion and anger from public investors when they receive confirmation of the 
sale of a security they understood they owned, we note that the order marking

89 17 CFR 242.200(a)-(f). 
 
90 Regulation SHO provides that an order can only be marked “long” if the seller is deemed to own the 
security being sold pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (f) of Rule 200 of Regulation SHO and either:  (i) 
The security to be delivered is in the physical possession or control of the broker or dealer; or (ii) It is 
reasonably expected that the security will be in the physical possession or control of the broker or dealer no 
later than settlement of the transaction.  See 17 CFR 242.200(g).  Thus, Regulation SHO contemplates that 
only those sell orders that will be available for delivery on settlement date can be marked “long.”

requirements are to facilitate the surveillance and monitoring of compliance with other 
provisions of Regulation SHO, such as the borrowing and delivery requirements for long 
sales under Rule 203(a),91 and the locate requirements for short sales under Rule 
203(b).92  Regulation SHO does not require that a broker-dealer reveal an order marking 
to its customer.  Nor do we believe at this time that it is necessary for a customer to 
receive such information.   
In addition, we have determined not to retain the “short exempt” marking 
requirement or revise the definition of when an order should be marked “short exempt” to 
include those circumstances in which a short sale is excepted from the locate 
requirements of Rule 203(b)(2) of Regulation SHO.93  The “short exempt” marking 
requirement has only ever applied if the seller is relying on an exception from a price test.  
It has never applied to sales that do not have to comply with the locate requirement of 
Regulation SHO.94  Today’s amendment to remove the “short exempt” marking 
requirement is necessitated by the fact that we are removing current price test restrictions 
and prohibiting any SRO from having a price test.  Thus, we do not believe that it is 
appropriate at this time to re-define the order marking requirements of Regulation SHO 
as suggested by commenters.  We will, however, consider separately whether further 
action in this area is necessary or warranted. 
With respect to the MFA’s and NYSE’s comments regarding the transparency of 
order markings to market participants other than those broker-dealers with responsibility

for compliance with the marking requirements of Regulation SHO, we have determined 
at this time to not take any action to limit the transparency of order markings in this 
way.95  We will continue, however, to review whether further action by the Commission 
on this matter is necessary or warranted.   
After carefully considering the comments received, we are adopting the proposed 
amendment without modification.    
IV. 
Other Comments 
We received eight comment letters from individual investors discussing other 
provisions of Regulation SHO,96 most notably the grandfather provision of that rule.97  In 
addition, these commenters expressed concerns about naked short selling.  This release 
discusses amendments that will affect price tests and related marking requirements only.  
They do not relate to other provisions of Regulation SHO or naked short selling, which 
are the subject of other Commission rulemaking.98
V. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
 
The adopted amendments to Regulation SHO impose a “collection of 
information” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995;99 however,

the collection of information is covered by the approved collection for Exchange Act 
Rule 19b-4.100  Rule 201(a) of Regulation SHO provides that no price test, including any 
price test of any SRO, shall apply to short sales in any security.  In addition, Rule 201(b) 
of Regulation SHO prohibits any SRO from having a price test.  Thus, to the extent that 
any SRO currently has a price test, that SRO is required to amend its rules to comply with 
these amendments to Regulation SHO.  Any such amendments will need to be filed with 
the Commission as proposed rule changes, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Exchange 
Act101 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.  This collection of information, however, will be 
collected pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 and, therefore, will not be a new 
collection of information for purposes of the amendments. 
VI. 
Consideration of Costs and Benefits of Proposed Amendments to Rule 10a-1 
and Regulation SHO 
 
 
The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits that result from our rules.  
Thus, in the Proposing Release, we solicited comments related to the costs and benefits 
associated with the proposed amendments.102  We explicitly requested that commenters 
provide supporting empirical data for any positions advanced.  In addition, we 
specifically requested comment regarding the costs and benefits of unrestricted short 
selling activity and any costs associated with complying with the proposed amendments, if 
the Commission were to adopt the proposed amendments.  We also requested comment 
regarding any costs relating to the removal of price test restrictions adopted by the SROs.  In 
addition, we requested comment on the potential costs for any modification to both

computer systems and surveillance mechanisms and for information gathering, 
management, and recordkeeping systems or procedures, as well as any potential benefits 
resulting from the proposals for registrants, issuers, investors, brokers or dealers, other 
securities industry professionals, regulators, and other market participants. 
 
Four commenters, the STA, UBS, SIFMA, and Amex provided comments related to 
the costs and benefits of the proposed rule amendments.103  We discuss these comment 
letters below. 
 
A. 
Removal of Price Test Restrictions 
 
1. 
Benefits 
 
In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment on any benefits that could be 
realized if the Commission adopts the proposed amendments, including both short-term 
and long-term benefits.  In addition, we solicited comment regarding benefits to market 
efficiency, pricing efficiency, market stability, market integrity, and investor protection.  
Only the STA submitted comments noting benefits of the proposed amendments.104   
 
In its comment letter, the STA noted that it does not believe that the proposed 
amendments would result in higher trading costs or wider spreads.105  In addition, the 
STA stated that it believes the proposed amendments would lead to a reduction in 
surveillance and compliance costs.106
 
We believe that this is an appropriate time to remove existing price test 
restrictions because current price test regulation is inconsistent across markets, 
                                                 
103 See STA Letter, supra note 23; UBS Letter, supra note 23; SIFMA Letter, supra note 23; Amex Letter,

potentially creates an unlevel playing field, allows for regulatory arbitrage and has not 
kept pace with the types of trading systems and strategies currently used in the 
marketplace.  In addition, today’s markets are characterized by high levels of 
transparency and regulatory surveillance.  These characteristics greatly reduce the risk of 
undetected manipulation and permit regulators to monitor for the types of activities that 
Rule 10a-1 and other price tests are designed to prevent. 
 
We believe that the removal of current price test restrictions will benefit market 
participants by providing market participants with the ability to execute short sales in all 
securities in all market centers without regard to price test restrictions.  In addition, 
market centers will be competing for executions on a level playing field because they will 
not be affected by the existence or non-existence of price test restrictions.     
 
We also believe that removing all current price test restrictions is preferable to 
applying different tests in different markets, which can require market participants to 
apply different rules to different securities depending on which market the trade is 
executed.  Thus, we believe that the amendments will reduce confusion and compliance 
difficulties for market participants.   
We also believe that the amendments will benefit exchanges and other market 
centers because market participants will no longer be able to select a market on which to 
execute a short sale based on the applicability of price test restrictions.  The amendments 
will remove a competitive disadvantage purportedly experienced by some market centers 
because market participants will no longer route orders to avoid application of a market 
center’s price test.  Nor will market centers that do not have a price test be able to use that 
factor to attract order flow away from market centers that have a price test.   
 
30
 
 
In addition, the amendments will result in benefits associated with systems and 
surveillance mechanisms because these systems and mechanisms will no longer need to 
be programmed to account for price test restrictions based on last sale and last bid 
information.  We also note that in the absence of price test restrictions, new staff 
(compliance personnel, associated persons, etc.) will no longer need to be trained 
regarding rules relating to price tests.  Over the long run, we believe this will likely lead 
to decreased training and compliance costs for market participants.  
We also believe that the amendments will lead to a reduction in costs because 
market participants and their lawyers, both in-house and outside counsel, will no longer 
need to make either informal (phone calls) or formal (letters) requests for exemptions 
from Rule 10a-1.   
   
In addition, we anticipate that the removal of price test restrictions may result in 
increased price efficiency because prices will be determined by buy and sell interest, 
without any artificial restraints on short selling.  
 
          2. 
 Costs  
 
We recognize that the amendments may result in some costs to market 
participants.  As an aid to evaluating the costs of the proposed amendments, we solicited 
comment in the Proposing Release.  In particular, we sought comment regarding the costs 
of the proposed amendments to market participants, including broker-dealers and SROs, 
related to systems changes to computer hardware and software, reprogramming costs, and 
surveillance and compliance costs, including whether these costs would be incurred on a 
 
31
 
 
one-time or ongoing basis.107  Four commenters, the STA, UBS, SIFMA and Amex 
submitted comments regarding costs associated with the proposed amendments.108   
 
In their comment letters, the STA, UBS and SIFMA noted potential 
reprogramming costs that market participants may incur if the Commission does not act 
on the proposed amendments prior to market participants reprogramming their systems in 
response to the new regulatory framework created by Regulation NMS109 and the desire 
of investors and other market participants for more automated and efficient trading 
services.110  On January 24, 2007, we extended the date for all automated trading centers 
(both SRO trading facilities and Alternative Display Facility participants) to have fully 
operational Regulation NMS-compliant trading systems to July 9, 2007 (the “Regulation 
NMS Compliance Date”).111  In meeting the Regulation NMS Compliance Date, market 
participants have been developing new systems or modifying existing systems to be 
Regulation NMS-compliant.   
 
In their comment letters, STA, UBS, and SIFMA urged the Commission to act on 
the proposed amendments prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date.112  In its letter, 
STA noted that “[i]f the SEC’s proposal is implemented subsequent to the operation of 
Regulation NMS to certain securities, it will require industry-wide reprogramming of 
Regulation NMS compliance systems during the infancy of the Rules implementation, a

most sensitive time period.  As a result, the immediate success of Regulation NMS could 
be compromised.”113  As discussed in Section IX below, these amendments will be 
effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register.  Thus, market 
participants will have notice and time prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date to 
reprogram their systems without regard to current price test restrictions. 
 
In its comment letter, Amex stated that “[w]hile it is difficult to predict future 
trading activities and the resultant need for new or different regulatory programs, [its] 
best estimate is that there would probably be no material impact on [its] regulatory 
costs.”114  Amex noted that although staff time and technology resources would no longer 
be required to monitor compliance with price tests, surveillance by Amex staff of order 
marking violations would still be required.  In addition, Amex commented that “the 
absence of a tick test to discourage potential “bear raids” and other manipulative 
activities could result in the need to devote additional resources to such regulatory 
programs than is currently the case.”115
 
We believe that costs associated with the amendments will be minimal because 
the infrastructure necessary to comply with the amendments are, for the most part, 
already be in place.  Market participants have needed to establish or modify their systems 
and surveillance mechanisms to exempt those securities included in the Pilot from all 
                                                 
113 STA Letter, supra note 23.  In addition, in its comment letter, SIFMA urged the Commission to take 
steps to eliminate price test restrictions prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date to alleviate the 
necessity for firms to, in the course of instituting programming changes to meet the new requirements of 
Regulation NMS, program systems to comply with price test restrictions, only to be required to reverse 
such programming costs shortly thereafter.  SIFMA stated that cost estimates for firms to program for such 
changes varied, from as low as approximately $200,000 for some firms to as high as $2 million for others.  
See SIFMA Letter, supra note 23.

price test restrictions.116  In addition, any further changes to systems and surveillance 
mechanisms or procedures will be relatively minor because the amendments will remove 
all price test restrictions rather than, for example, impose a modified price test.  We also 
believe that market participants will not need to incur costs to purchase new systems, or 
increase staffing based solely on the implementation of the amendments.   
 
Although we recognize that market participants may incur costs to modify, 
establish or implement existing or new supervisory and compliance procedures due to the 
amendments, these costs will be minimal because market participants already have in 
place supervisory or compliance procedures to monitor for trading activity that current 
price test restrictions are designed to deter.   
 
We recognize that SROs that have adopted price tests will incur costs associated 
with removing such price tests.  For example, the NASD and Nasdaq have their own bid 
tests that, under the amendments, will no longer be applicable.117  In addition, some 
exchanges have adopted rules in conformity with the provisions of Rule 10a-1, which 
will no longer be applicable.  SROs may incur costs associated with the processes to 
remove such rules, including filing rule changes with the Commission, as well as 
reprogramming systems designed to enforce these rules.  Although we requested 
                                                 
116 The Pilot exempts a select group of securities from price test restrictions during regular trading hours.  
Between the close of the consolidated tape and the open of the consolidated tape on the following day, 
however, all equity securities are exempted from price test restrictions.  See 69 FR at 48033.

comment regarding these costs, including costs relating to preparing and filing any 
necessary rule changes with the Commission,118 we did not receive any comments. 
 
We also recognize that the amendments may increase transaction costs, decrease 
quoted depth, and increase intraday price volatility, particularly in small stocks.  The 
Pilot results suggest, however, that these changes are small in magnitude and would not 
significantly increase costs or reduce liquidity.119
B. 
Removal of “Short Exempt” Marking Requirement 
1. 
Benefits 
We are amending Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO to remove the “short exempt” 
marking requirement.120  Rule 200(g)(2) of Regulation SHO provides that a short sale 
order must be marked “short exempt” if the seller is “relying on an exception from the 
tick test of 17 CFR 240.10a-1, or any short sale price test of any exchange or national 
securities association.”121  Thus, because we are removing all current price test 
restrictions, as well as prohibiting any SRO from having a price test, the “short exempt” 
marking requirement will no longer be applicable.  In addition, we note that removing the 
“short exempt” marking requirement will promote regulatory simplification because the 
marking requirement will no longer be applicable.   
2. 
Costs 
Although we sought public comment on costs, we did not receive any such 
comments relating to this proposed amendment.  We recognize, however, that there may 
                                                 
118 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75079-75080.

be some costs associated with removing the “short exempt” marking requirement.  Some 
market participants, including broker-dealers and SROs, may have to reprogram systems 
and update supervisory procedures due to the removal of the “short exempt” marking 
requirement.  Sales of securities previously marked “short exempt,” however, will 
continue to be marked either “long” or “short.”  Thus, we believe that such costs will be 
minor.   
VII.  Consideration of Burden on Competition and Promotion of Efficiency, 
Competition, and Capital Formation 
 
 
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, whenever it engages 
in rulemaking and whenever it is required to consider or determine if an action is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider whether the action would 
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.122  In addition, Section 23(a)(2) 
of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange 
Act, to consider the impact such rules would have on competition.123  Exchange Act 
Section 23(a)(2) prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the 
Exchange Act.   
 
 
In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment on the proposed amendments’ 
effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.  In addition, we requested, but 
did not receive, comments regarding the impact of the proposed amendments on the

economy generally pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
of 1996.124
 
We have considered the proposed amendments to Rule 10a-1 and Regulation 
SHO in light of the standards of Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and believe the 
adopted amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act. 
 
The amendments will remove the price test restrictions of Rule 10a- 1125 and 
provide that no price test, including any price test of any SRO, shall apply to short sales 
in any security.  The amendments will also prohibit any SRO from having a price test.  In 
addition, the amendments will remove the “short exempt” marking requirement of Rule 
200(g) of Regulation SHO because this marking requirement applies only if the seller is 
relying on an exception from the tick test of Rule 10a-1 or any short sale price test of any 
exchange or national securities association. 
 
Current short sale regulation is inconsistent.  For example, Rule 10a-1 applies 
only to short sale transactions in listed securities.  The NASD’s and Nasdaq’s bid tests 
apply only to Nasdaq Global Market securities.  No price tests apply to short sales in 
Nasdaq Capital Market securities or securities quoted on the OTCBB or pink sheets.  In 
addition, no price test applies to short sales of Nasdaq Global Market securities executed 
on exchanges trading Nasdaq securities on a UTP basis, unless the market on which the 
securities are being traded has adopted its own price test.  Moreover, the current 
exceptions to, and exemptions from, the price tests for a wide range of short selling 
activities have limited the applicability of the restrictions contained in these rules.  The

125 17 CFR 242.10a-1. 
 
37
 
 
end result is inconsistent short sale regulation of securities, depending on the market 
where the securities are trading, and the type of short selling activity.  Thus, the 
amendments are intended to promote regulatory simplification and uniformity by no 
longer permitting the current price test restrictions on short selling.   
 
We believe that the amendments will not harm efficiency because the empirical 
evidence from the Pilot Results shows that the Pilot did not adversely impact price 
efficiency.  Further, market participants will no longer have to apply different price tests 
to securities trading in different markets.   
In addition, we believe that the amendments will not have an adverse impact on 
capital formation because the empirical evidence from the Pilot Results shows that the 
price tests have very little impact on overall market quality and, particularly in large 
securities, may be harmful to overall market quality.     
We believe that the amendments will promote competition among exchanges and 
other market centers because market participants will no longer be able to select a market 
on which to execute a short sale based on the applicability of price test restrictions.  The 
amendments will remove a purported competitive disadvantage experienced by some 
market centers because market participants will no longer route orders to avoid 
application of a market center’s price test.  Nor will market centers that do not have a 
price test be able to use that factor to attract order flow away from market centers that 
have a price test.  Moreover, the amendments will level the playing field for all market 
participants by requiring that no price test shall apply to any short sale in any security in 
any market.126
                                                 
126 Although we recognize there could conceivably be a need in the future for SROs to propose new price 
test restrictions, in considering whether to approve any such proposals, the Commission would, among 
 
38
 
 
VIII. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
 
 
The Commission has prepared the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(“FRFA”), in accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(“RFA”),127 regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 10a-1 and Regulation SHO, 
Rules 200 and 201, under the Exchange Act.   
A. 
Need for the Amendments 
 
Based on the Pilot Results as well as our review of the status of short sale 
regulation in the context of the current application of Rule 10a-1 and other price tests, 
including the exceptions to the current rules and grants of relief from Rule 10a-1 by the 
Commission for a wide range of short selling activities, we believe it is necessary to 
remove Rule 10a-1 and to amend Regulation SHO to provide that no price test, including 
any price test by any SRO, shall apply to short selling in any security.  In addition, the 
amendments will prohibit any SRO from having a price test.  These amendments are 
designed to modernize and simplify short sale regulation in light of current short selling 
systems and strategies used in the marketplace, while providing greater regulatory 
consistency to short selling.  We are also removing the “short exempt” marking 
requirement of Regulation SHO because this requirement only applies if a seller is 
relying on an exception to a price test. 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                 
other things, determine whether or not such proposals are consistent with the objectives of today’s 
amendments.  Additionally, in order for an SRO to adopt new price test restrictions pursuant to Section 
19(b) of the Exchange Act, an exemption from the provisions of Rule 201 pursuant to Section 36 of the 
Exchange Act would be necessary.

B. 
Significant Issues Raised by Public Comment 
The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) appeared in the Proposing 
Release.128  We requested comment in the IRFA on the impact the proposed amendments 
would have on small entities and how to quantify the impact.  We received two comment 
letters generally discussing the impact of the proposed amendments to remove price test 
restrictions on small issuers,129 which we discuss below.  
 
C. 
Small Entities Subject to the Rule 
 
The entities covered by the amendment will include small broker-dealers, small 
businesses, and any investor who effects a short sale that qualifies as a small entity.  
Although it is impossible to quantify every type of small entity that may be able to effect 
a short sale in a security, Paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 0-10 under the Exchange Act130 states 
that the term “small business” or “small organization,” when referring to a broker-dealer, 
means a broker or dealer that had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of 
less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial 
statements were prepared pursuant to §240.17a-5(d); and is not affiliated with any person 
(other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization.  In the 
IRFA in the Proposing Release, we estimated that as of 2005, there were approximately 
                                                 
128 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75081-75082. 
 
129 See IASBDA Letter, supra note 39; Amex Letter, supra note 44.  IASBDA expressed concern that the 
proposed amendments might “unnecessarily force small issuers to accept an environment which is most 
unkind to their securities.”  See IASBDA Letter, supra note 39.  In its letter, Amex advocated for additional 
study of the effects of price test restrictions on small capitalization securities before the Commission 
removes such restrictions on these securities.  See Amex Letter, supra note 44.

910 broker-dealers that qualified as small entities as defined above.131  Presently, we 
estimate that as of 2006 there are approximately 894 broker-dealers that qualify as small 
entities, as defined above.132   
Paragraph (e) of Rule 0-10 under the Exchange Act133 states that the term "small 
business" or "small organization," when referring to an exchange, means any exchange 
that: (1) has been exempted from the reporting requirements of Rule 11Aa3-1 under the 
Exchange Act; and (2) is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that 
is not a small business or small organization, as defined by Rule 0-10.  No national 
securities exchanges are small entities because none meets these criteria.  There is one 
national securities association (NASD) that is subject to these amendments.  NASD is not 
a small entity as defined by 13 CFR 121.201.  
Any business, however, regardless of industry, will be subject to the amendments 
if it effects a short sale.  The Commission believes that, except for the broker-dealers 
discussed above, an estimate of the number of small entities that fall under the 
amendments is not feasible. 
 
D. 
Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance Requirements 
We recognize that the amendments may impose some new or additional reporting, 
recordkeeping, or compliance costs on any affected party, including broker-dealers, that 
are small entities.   
                                                 
131 These numbers are based on OEA’s review of 2005 FOCUS Report filings reflecting registered broker-
dealers.  This number does not include broker-dealers that are delinquent on FOCUS Report filings.

As discussed above, three commenters noted potential reprogramming costs that 
market participants may incur if the Commission does not act on the proposed 
amendments prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date.  In meeting the Regulation 
NMS Compliance Date, market participants have been developing new systems or 
modifying existing systems to be Regulation NMS-compliant.  In their comment letters, 
STA, UBS, and SIFMA urged the Commission to act on the proposed amendments prior 
to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date.134  In its letter, STA noted that “[i]f the SEC’s 
proposal is implemented subsequent to the operation of Regulation NMS to certain 
securities, it will require industry-wide re-programming of Regulation NMS compliance 
systems during the infancy of the Rules implementation, a most sensitive time period.  As 
a result, the immediate success of Regulation NMS could be compromised.”135  As 
discussed in Section IX below, these amendments will be effective immediately upon 
publication in the Federal Register.  Thus, market participants will have notice and time 
prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance Date to reprogram their systems without regard 
to current price test restrictions. 
 
In order to comply with the Pilot when it became effective on May 2, 2005, small 
entities needed to modify their systems and surveillance mechanisms to exempt those 
securities included in the Pilot from current price test restrictions.  Thus, the systems and 
surveillance mechanisms required to comply with the amendments are already be in 
place.  We believe that any necessary additional systems and surveillance changes will be 
small because, due to the Pilot, systems are currently programmed to exempt many

securities from price test restrictions prior to the close of the consolidated tape and 
exempt all securities from price test restrictions between the close of the consolidated 
tape and the open of the consolidated tape on the following day.   
We believe that any reprogramming costs or updating of surveillance mechanisms 
associated with the removal of the “short exempt” marking requirement will be minimal 
because sales of securities will continue to be required to be marked either “long” or 
“short.”  The amendments will merely remove an alternative marking requirement. 
 
E. 
Agency Action to Minimize the Effect on Small Entities  
 
The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that will 
accomplish the stated objective, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on 
small entities.  Pursuant to Section 3(a) of the RFA,136 the Commission considered the 
following types of alternatives in connection with the amendments: (a) the establishment 
of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; (b) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification 
of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (c) the use of 
performance rather than design standards; and (d) an exemption from coverage of the 
rule, or any part thereof, for small entities. 
 
The amendments are intended to modernize and simplify price test regulation by 
removing restrictions on the execution prices of short sales contained in current price 
tests, such as Rule 10a-1.  As such, we believe that imposing different compliance 
requirements, and possibly a different timetable for implementing compliance 
requirements, for small entities would undermine the goal of the amendments.  In 
                                                 
136 5 U.S.C. 603(c).

particular, the request by IASBDA and Amex for a gradual phase-in of the amendments 
to permit price test restrictions to continue for small securities pending further study, 
would cause considerable uncertainty, such as how to treat securities that episodically 
move between the definition of small and large capitalization.  Moreover, we do not 
believe that such an approach would provide new results relevant to smaller securities.  
As we noted in the Proposing Release, while there is some evidence supporting the 
application of price test restrictions to smaller securities, the evidence is not strong 
enough to warrant its continuation in any subset of securities.137  In addition, we note that 
many smaller or thinly-traded securities, such as Nasdaq Capital Market securities, and 
securities quoted on the OTCBB and pink sheets, are not currently subject to any price 
test restrictions. 
 
Thus, we have concluded that it would be inconsistent with the goal of the 
amendments to phase-in small capitalization securities or to further clarify, consolidate, 
or simplify the amendments for small entities.  Finally, the amendments will impose 
performance standards rather than design standards. 
IX. 
Administrative Procedure Act 
 
Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) generally provides 
that a substantive rule may not be made effective less than 30 days after notice is 
published in the Federal Register.138  Two exceptions to the 30-day requirement, among 
                                                 
137 See Proposing Release, 71 FR at 75076.  See also, supra, note 65 (discussing a prior study by academics 
of price test restrictions on smaller securities).

others, are (i) for a substantive rule that relieves a restriction, and (ii) an agency's finding 
of good cause for providing a shorter effective date.139  
 
 The amendments will remove all current restrictions on the price at which a 
security can be sold short.  Because the amendments relieve a restriction on short selling, 
these amendments may be made effective less than 30 days after notice is published in 
the Federal Register. 
 
In addition, we note that a number of commenters to the proposed amendments 
discussed potential reprogramming costs that market participants may incur if the 
proposed amendments are not effective prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance 
Date.140  In meeting the Regulation NMS Compliance Date, market participants have 
been developing new systems or modifying existing systems to be Regulation NMS-
compliant.  Immediate effectiveness of these amendments is necessary to provide market 
participants with sufficient notice and time prior to the Regulation NMS Compliance 
Date to reprogram their systems without regard to current price test restrictions. 
    Specifically, immediate effectiveness of the amendments is expected to 
alleviate any necessity for market participants to, in the course of instituting 
programming changes to meet the requirements of Regulation NMS, program systems to 
comply with price test restrictions, only to be required to reverse such programming 
shortly thereafter.  Absent immediate effectiveness, market participants may expend 
unnecessary time and resources programming systems to comply with price test 
restrictions that are being removed.  Thus, the Commission finds that there is good cause 
                                                 
139 See id. at 553(d)(1), 553(d)(3).

for making the amendments effective immediately upon publication in the Federal 
Register.
