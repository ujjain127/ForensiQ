ÎThe aircraft manufacturer are required to demonstrate that polymer 
structural composites provide an equivalent safety level to the current 
material (aluminium alloy) 
Increase in the use of composite materials in new aircraft 
programs (structural applications and fuselages)
 The use of composite structures has been increased because of the advantages 
composites offer over metal
 Boeing 787 or Airbus 350 will 
have about 50 % of the structural 
weight including wings and fuselage
 Currently, there is no fire requirement on composite materials used outside the cabin, 
cargo compartment and fire zones

A small scale test was developed by the CEAT in 1996 to assess the 
fire behaviour of thermal insulation blankets.
Many tests were carried out on assemblies including aluminium 
skin & insulation blankets which gave a good repeatability on 
burnthrough time, smoke density and toxicity.

In 2002, this test device was widely used to assess the fire

fuselage skin (partially used on A380).

CONCLUSIONS & NEXT WORKS
Not possible to easily compare the smoke densities from the BT smoke box test to 
the acceptance criteria from the NBS test chamber
Scale factor has been determined to compare the toxic gas concentrations from the 
BT smoke box to the acceptance criteria from the NBS test chamber
Scale factor has been determined to compare the toxic gas concentrations from the 
CEAT BT smoke box and from the FAA BT smoke box
Few toxic species are currently analyzed  (we need to buy other standard gas 
mixtures)
We need to perform more tests on various materials to compare the FTIR gas 
analysis to the sampling gas analysis

Burnthrough time : this fire source is probably very close to the 
FAA fire source used on wind tunnel test (FAA burnthrough time :   
9 to 10 mn (thickness 3.175 mm (1/4 inch)):
• an estimation of the burnthrough time using our fire source on an 
aluminum plate of this thickness is in the same range.

CONCLUSIONS
The flame characteristics  (T° / Heat Flux) of the gas burner and the FAA foam block 
fire sources are very close
The damages generated on composite material (epoxy/carbon) by the CEAT’s hidden 
fire source (exposure time : 45s (close to the duration of the active combustion of the foam block) and by 
the foam block fire source are rather similar
The hidden fire source seems a little more severe. (should be easily corrected by 
modifications of the burner settings)
Burnthrough of aluminum : The effect of the CEAT hidden Fire Source and the FAA 
fire source used for the wind tunnel fire test (under static conditions) are similar
