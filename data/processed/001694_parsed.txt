For example, every time you get into a car,
there are risks—the possibility that unwant-
ed or unexpected things could happen.You
could have an accident, causing costly damage
to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved
one. But there are also benefits to riding in a
car: you can travel farther and faster than
walking, bring home more groceries from the
store, and travel in cold or wet weather in
greater comfort.
To obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you
think through the risks.You consider
the condition of your car and the road, for
instance, before deciding to make that trip 
to the store.
The same is true before using any medicine.
Every choice to take a medicine involves
thinking through the helpful effects as
well as the possible unwanted effects.
Although medicines can make you
feel better and help you get well,
it’s important to know that ALL
medicines, both prescription and
over-the-counter, have risks as 
well as benefits. 
The benefits of medicines are the help-
ful effects you get when you use them, such
as lowering blood pressure, curing infection
or relieving pain.The risks of medicines
are the chances that something unwanted
or unexpected could happen to you when
you use them. Risks could be less serious
things, such as an upset stomach, or more
serious things, such as liver damage.
When a medicine’s benefits outweigh its
known risks, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) considers it safe
enough to approve. But before using any
medicine—as with many things that you do
every day—you should think through
the benefits and the risks in order to make
the best choice for you.
There are several types of risks 
from medicine use:
• The possibility of a harmful interaction
between the medicine and a food,
beverage, dietary supplement (including
vitamins and herbals), or another medicine.
Combinations of any of these products
could increase the chance that there may
be interactions.
• The chance that the medicine may not 
work as expected.
• The possibility that the medicine may 
cause additional problems.

Here are Some Specific Ways to Lower the Risks and Obtain the Full Benefits of Medicines
Remember: Think it Through and Work Together with Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other
Health Care Professional to Better Manage the Benefits and Risks of Your Medicines
The benefit/risk decision is sometimes
difficult to make.The best choice
depends on your particular situation.
You must decide what risks you can
and will accept in order to get the 
benefits you want. For example, if facing
a life-threatening illness, you might
choose to accept more risk in the hope
of getting the benefits of a cure or 
living a longer life. On the other hand, if
you are facing a minor illness, you might
decide that you want to take very little
risk. In many situations, the expert
advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or
other health care professionals can help
you make the decision.
Talk with Your Doctor,
Pharmacist, or Other Health 
Care Professionals
• Keep an up-to-date, written list of ALL of
the medicines (prescription and over-the-
counter) and dietary supplements, including
vitamins and herbals, that you use—even
those you only use occasionally.
• Share this list with ALL of your health 
care professionals.
• Tell about any allergies or sensitivities 
that you may have.
• Tell about anything that could affect your
ability to take medicines, such as difficulty
swallowing or remembering to take them.
• Tell if you are or might become pregnant,
or if you are nursing a baby.
• Always ask questions about any concerns 
or thoughts that you may have.
