A CALL TO ACTION: THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON TRANSFORMATIONAL 
DIPLOMACY. The Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Transformational 
Diplomacy. Final Report. February 2008 
 
"The world is in a state of rapid and accelerating change. To keep pace 
with this change and to continue to play its leadership role into the 21st 
century, the United States must transform its diplomatic presence and 
capabilities. While the Secretary of State’s Transformational 
Diplomacy agenda has begun to move the Department of State in new 
and important directions, additional effort is needed. 
 
This Call to Action sets out the views of this Committee on the 
growing demands faced by U.S. diplomacy and the Department of 
State. It summarizes our unanimous recommendations on the urgent 
actions needed to position the Department to best promote America’s interests in an ever 
more complex world. This includes increasing the available financial and human resources, 
streamlining the organizational structure, embracing new technology, and shifting the 
organization’s emphasis from one of process to one of results. 
 
Our hope is that these recommendations will form a basis for bipartisan action by the 
Department of State and the Executive and Legislative Branches to modernize U.S. 
diplomacy and enable our nation to maintain its leadership role well into the future."

TRANSFORMING THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES INTO A 21ST-
CENTURY OPERATIONAL FORCE. Executive Summary. Commission on the National 
Guard and Reserves. January 31, 2008 
 
This report is the first step in a comprehensive reevaluation of the 
reserve components of the U.S. military in which the legislature and 
general public soon should join. In reviewing the past several decades of 
heavy use of the reserve components, most notably as an integral part of 
recent operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in the homeland, the 
Commission has found indisputable and overwhelming evidence of the 
need for change. Policymakers and the military must break with 
outdated policies and processes and implement fundamental, thorough 
reforms. Many of today’s profound challenges to the National Guard 
and Reserves will persist, notwithstanding force reductions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. The need for major reforms is urgent regardless of the outcome of current 
conflicts or the political turmoil surrounding them. The Commission believes the nation must 
look past the immediate and compelling challenges raised by these conflicts and focus on the 
long-term future of the National Guard and Reserves and on the United States’ enduring 
national security interests.

WHAT WE NEED NEXT IN IRAQ. By Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. Published 
in The Washington Post.  February 13, 2008. 
 
"There is little doubt that 2008 will be a year of critical transition in Iraq as our force levels 
continue to come down, as our mission changes and as Iraqis continue to assert their 
sovereignty. But to continue the success we have seen in recent months, the Iraqi people and 
government will continue to need our help. Iraqis have requested a normalized relationship 
with us, and such a relationship will be part of a foundation of success in Iraq -- a foundation 
upon which future U.S. administrations can build."

apocalypse -- war, famine, strife and death -- decided to practice first in Afghanistan. 
 
An overabundance of security, governance and economic problems still besets this country. 
 
Topping the list is an aggressive insurgency, focused especially on Southern and Eastern 
Afghanistan. The Taliban and their ilk seek a twisted victory, by instigating fear among the 
Afghan people via road-side and suicide bombs. And their campaign of intimidation goes 
further than the Afghan people -- they want to sow doubt among Afghanistan’s Western 
friends by making success appear out of reach.

IRAN SANCTIONS: IMPACT IN FURTHERING U.S. OBJECTIVES IS UNCLEAR 
AND SHOULD BE REVIEWED.  GAO-08-58, U.S. General Accountability Office 
(GAO).  Web posted January 16, 2008. 08AD419 
 
U.S. officials report that U.S. sanctions have slowed foreign investment in 
Iran’s petroleum sector, denied parties involved in Iran’s proliferation and 
terrorism activities access to the U.S. financial system, and provided a clear 
statement of U.S. concerns to the rest of the world. However, other evidence 
raises questions about the extent of reported impacts.

The Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) 
reviews and authorizes arms exporting licenses.  GAO found three key 
trends that this Office is “under stress”:  (1) between 2003 and 2006, the 
number of arms export cases processed increased by 20 percent; (2) during 
the same time period, processing times almost doubled; and (3) the number 
of open arms export cases increased by 50 percent.  GAO recommends that 
State conduct a systematic analysis to help increase efficiency in processing 
arms export cases.  State concurs with this recommendation.

Both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government support democracy 
promotion in other countries, and they have implemented bilateral and multilateral programs 
to promote it.  Congress appropriates funds and authorizes programs.  Congress also has 
oversight responsibility and attempts to determine when, where, and how these programs 
operate, and if the desired results are achieved.  The 110th Congress may scrutinize these 
democracy promotion activities in Iraq more closely, which could affect democracy 
promotion elsewhere.

Secretary. February 13, 2008  
 
The House of Representatives must act now to pass a bipartisan Senate bill that will ensure 
our intelligence professionals continue to have the critical tools they need to protect the 
Nation.  On Tuesday, the Senate cast a strong bipartisan vote in support of this legislation, 
which will ensure our intelligence professionals have the tools they need to make us safer and 
will also provide fair and just liability protection for companies that did the right thing and 
assisted in defending America after the 9/11 attacks.  
 
Congress has had more than six months to act – there is no reason to stall this important 
legislation.  Failure by the House to pass this bill by the end of the week, when the Protect 
America Act (PAA) expires, will weaken our ability to obtain vital foreign intelligence 
information, including the location, intentions, and capabilities of terrorists and other foreign 
intelligence targets abroad.

AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES STRENGTHENING GLOBAL SECURITY FOR 
EUROPE. Ambassador Victoria Nuland, United States Permanent Representative to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Speech to Presse Club and AmCham. Paris, 
France. February 22, 2008 
 
"Today the challenges we face run the gamut from terror, and violent extremism and weapons 
of mass destruction to the need to decrease our dependence on carbon fuels and address the 
poverty, disease and hunger that still afflict too much of the world's population.  Together, we 
must manage a Kremlin that has tightened its grip on state power, suspended the conventional 
forces in Europe treaty and threatened to target missiles at its neighbors, even as we work 
together with Russia on Iran, North Korea and other vital shared interests. We must maintain 
the right mix of diplomacy and offers of political and economic engagement and pressure on 
Iran to come back into compliance with the UNSC, abandon terror and give its people the 
future they deserve.  And we must encourage China to use its growing power for stability and 
peace, in its neighborhood and globally.  In short, we are living in a complex and dangerous 
world -- one that requires those of us who are blessed to live in free societies to join forces to 
protect what we have at home and to secure and enlarge the democratic community. 
 
As we in the United States look across the globe for partners in meeting these challenges we 
of course look to our Asian Allies and other strong democracies to our South and to our East.  
But our first stop is often at the European Union.  Of course to the 27 member states but 
increasingly to the institution itself."

STATEMENT  BY THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL AFTER KOSOVO’S 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. February 18, 2008 
 
Following Kosovo’s declaration of independence yesterday, NATO reaffirms that KFOR 
shall remain in Kosovo on the basis of UNSCR 1244, as agreed by Foreign Ministers in 
December 2007, unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. 
 
NATO’s responsibility and capability to ensure a safe and secure environment in Kosovo 
remain unchanged. KFOR will continue to execute this mandate in an impartial manner in 
accordance with its Operational Plan. NATO will respond resolutely to any attempts to 
disrupt the safety and security of the population of Kosovo.   
 
NATO continues to attach great importance to the implementation of standards in Kosovo, 
especially regarding the rule of law, the protection of ethnic minorities and communities, as 
well as the protection of historical and religious sites.   
 
NATO’s objective is to continue helping in the development of a stable, democratic, multi-
ethnic and peaceful Kosovo. As Foreign Ministers also agreed in December 2007, NATO 
will continue to cooperate closely with the population of Kosovo, the United Nations, the 
European Union and other international actors wherever appropriate.

time we are called to defend our security and values so far from home.

IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN THE LEVANT, IRAQ, AND AFGHANISTAN. By 
Frederick W. Kagan, Danielle Pletka, Kimberly Kagan. PAPERS AND STUDIES. AEI 
Online February 19, 2008  
  
The conflict between Iran and the United States began in 1979 with the 
Iranian Revolution and the seizure of the American Embassy in 
Tehran. Born partly of ideological differences and partly of real and 
perceived differing national interests, it has continued, alternately hot 
and cold, for almost three decades and seems unlikely to end soon. 
Like most previous conflicts, its conclusion cannot be foreseen. Many 
such struggles, like the Anglo-German tensions between 1871 and 
1945 and the centuries-long tensions between Britain and France, lead 
to full-scale war. Others, like the Anglo-Russian or Russian-Ottoman 
tensions throughout the nineteenth century, lead to more limited 
conflict. And some, like the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, are resolved without direct armed 
confrontation. One key to resolving any such conflict is understanding both the nature of the 
enemy and the scope of the conflict--insights that have eluded most Americans and, indeed, 
many Iranians. This report addresses this lack of understanding and argues that while neither 
Americans nor Iranians desire full-scale military confrontation, Iranian activism and 
American passivity are contributing to a drift toward war.

DISSENT AND REFORM IN THE ARAB WORLD: EMPOWERING DEMOCRATS. 
Edited by Michael Rubin, Danielle Pletka, Jeffrey Azarva. A Report 
of the American Enterprise Institute Dissent and Reform in the 
Arab World Project. AEI Press  (Washington).  February 13, 2008  
  
The Arab world suffers from a debilitating democracy deficit. The 
region's ruling governments' antipathy for pluralism, political dissent, 
and free speech have helped to incubate extremism by denying outlets 
for peaceful expression to all but a privileged few.

In U.S. policy circles, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, conventional wisdom 
remained that partnerships with illiberal Arab governments, no matter how unsavory, would 
best serve U.S. national security. Following September 11, 2001, however, most U.S. 
policymakers concluded that promoting democracy was not only the best antidote for the 
region's woes, but also Washington's best safeguard against future attacks.  
 
No sooner had this tectonic shift in U.S. foreign policy occurred, however, than questions 
about its viability and wisdom arose. Do democrats exist in the Arab world? Are Arab 
societies fit for democratic self-government? Will Islamist extremism wrongly benefit from 
popular participation?  
 
To try the efficacy of pro-democracy policies in the Arab world, the American Enterprise 
Institute initiated the "Dissent and Reform in the Arab World" project. Directed by Danielle 
Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies, and Michael Rubin, resident 
scholar, the project commissioned essays from Arab reformers and activists who championed 
the causes of liberal democracy long before such calls ever reverberated in Western capitals. 
Together, these authentic voices dispel the fiction that the Arab world is infertile ground for 
democracy.

THE PROPOSED U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENT TO IRAQ: WHAT WILL BE IN 
IT AND SHOULD IT BE A TREATY? By Michael Rubin. TESTIMONY. House Foreign 
Affairs Committee  (Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and 
Oversight and Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia)  January 23, 2008 
 
"On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki 
released a "Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and 
Friendship between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America." Among the 
principles they outlined were: 
 
• Provision of "security assurances and commitments to the Republic of Iraq to deter 
foreign aggression against Iraq that violates its sovereignty and integrity of its 
territories, waters, or airspace."  
• Support for "the Republic of Iraq in its efforts to combat all terrorist 
groups…consistent with mechanisms and arrangements to be established in the 
bilateral cooperation agreements…" and  
• Support for "the Republic of Iraq in training, equipping, and arming the Iraqi Security 
Forces to enable them to protect Iraq and all its peoples, and completing the building 
of its administrative systems, in accordance with the request of the Iraqi government." 
 
(…) Throughout this year, the U.S. and Iraqi government will negotiate the details of a 
security agreement to replace the UN's Chapter VII mandate. The details are crucial to the 
question at hand, but remain unclear. The proposed agreement could take many forms and, 
indeed, could be a package of multiple agreements, ranging from a Status of Forces 
Agreement (SOFA) to economic development packages to basing agreements, to a formal 
defense treaty."

MANAGING A CROSS-STRAIT CRISIS: The Limitations of Crisis Management 
Theory. By Gary J. Schmitt, Tim Sullivan. NATIONAL SECURITY OUTLOOK. AEI 
Online. January 2008 
 
Nowhere in the world is the danger of a major war more serious in its 
potential consequences than in the Taiwan Strait. Policymakers both here and 
in the region are interested in finding ways to avoid a military confrontation 
between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China 
(PRC). But should one begin, they will need to have available the tools to 
avoid a full-fledged conflagration. Naturally enough, security specialists have 
turned to the crisis management literature to devise strategies for addressing 
this latter problem. Are the literature and the strategies it has generated a good 
fit for the case of China and Taiwan--and, if not, what should be done to 
prepare for managing such a crisis?

SIX YEARS LATER: INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO DEFEATING AL QAEDA. 
Daniel L. Byman, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, Saban Center for Middle East Policy. 
Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform. February 14, 2008 
 
It is a truism widely repeated that the United States must think differently to confront the 
challenge of terrorism in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Yet, despite spending billions of 
dollars and the passage of over six years, much remains to be done before the United States is 
ready to meet its new adversary. 
(The) testimony focuses on ways to improve the following aspects of U.S. counterterrorism: 
1. use of force; 2. collection and employment of intelligence; 3. homeland security strategy; 
4. information campaigns; and 5. diplomatic alliances. I conclude with a call for a more 
informed public debate—such as this hearing—to review the most controversial 
counterterrorism measures and develop a broad consensus on the appropriate measures.

Commentary published in The Washington Post. February 09, 2008 
 
The Kurds are making a major mistake. They should rethink their approach both out of 
fairness to the United States, which has given them a chance to help build a post-Hussein 
Iraq, and in the interests of the Kurds and their neighbors. Baghdad needs a role in 
developing future oil fields and sharing revenue; Kirkuk needs to remain where it is in Iraq's 
political system, or perhaps attain a special status. It should not be muscled away into 
Kurdistan.

BUILDING CAPACITY FOR STABILIZATION & RECONSTRUCTION. By Carlos 
Pascual, Vice President and Director, Foreign Policy, Brooking Institution. House Armed 
Services Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations. January 29, 2008 
 
"Let me just underscore a couple of key findings from the work that we've learned -- done 
and things that we've learned from stabilization and reconstruction. 
 
First is that it takes at least five to 10 years until it's possible to get local partners to really 
take the lead in stabilization and reconstruction effort. To imagine that you can build capacity 
and help them build capacity any faster is a fantasy and it just simply hasn't been done. Look 
at small states like Bosnia and Kosovo. 
(…) 
The other thing that we have to understand is that we need multilateral engagement to 
succeed in order to have the depth and the range and the time commitment that is necessary 
to undertake these missions. Afghanistan is a good example, where we have the U.N. and 
NATO and the United States and 30 nations. And here, we are still struggling to succeed. To 
imagine that we can do this alone is just simply a fantasy. If we even look at tiny Kosovo and 
the effort that it's taken multilaterally, we have to remember that the capacity that we build as 
the United States to be successful has to be leveraged with multilateral engagement. 
 
And finally, I would underscore that security is a prerequisite."

PROPERTY RIGHTS SHOULD BE SECURED.  Rhodri C. Williams.  Brookings-Bern 
Project on Internal Displacement, Brookings Institution.  January 8, 2008. 08AD411 
 
Recent proposals have been made for “soft partition” of Iraq through a process of 
decentralization rather than the creation of separate national entities.  The U.S. Senate passed 
a non-binding resolution to this effect in September, 2007.  This document looks at the 
proposals and compares them to the similar effort made in Bosnia in the early 1990’s.

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE
 
ASSESSING SECRETARY OF STATE RICE'S REFORM OF U.S. FOREIGN 
ASSISTANCE. By Gerald Hyman. Carnegie Endowment. Carnegie Paper, February 
2008   
 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s ambitious reorganization of the 
U.S. foreign assistance efforts last year is deeply, perhaps irredeemably 
flawed, but did produce some positive results, says a new paper from 
the Carnegie Endowment. 
 
Reforms aimed at making foreign assistance an instrument of the 
administration’s “transformational diplomacy,” and ensuring greater 
transparency and oversight instead created an overly centralized and 
complex system that was rushed into practice.  
 
In Assessing Secretary of State Rice’s Reform of U.S. Foreign Assistance, former senior 
USAID official Gerald Hyman analyzes the objectives, implementation, and impact of the 
Secretary’s effort to create a cohesive foreign assistance program fully integrated with U.S. 
national security policy.

THE ROAD OUT OF GAZA. By Nathan Brown. Carnegie Endowment. Policy Outlook 
No. 39, February 2008   
 
The Middle East peace process will fail unless Palestinian political 
institutions are rebuilt, argues a new paper from the Carnegie 
Endowment. The rebuilding of viable political structures to represent 
and serve the Palestinians is the only way to move beyond the current 
political stalemate and the failed effort to build a Palestinian state.  
In The Road out of Gaza, Palestinian expert Nathan J. Brown discusses 
the economic and political disarray not only in Gaza and the West 
Bank but within Hamas and Fatah as well, and argues that the 
international efforts to rebuild Palestine are in reality 
counterproductive. Brown suggests a long-term international strategy 
based on restoring Palestinian institutions, encouraging a Fatah–Hamas agreement, and 
emphasizing regional diplomacy.

THE SITUATION IN IRAQ: A BRIEFING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD. Anthony 
Cordesman, Burke Chair in Strategy. February 13, 2008   
 
No one can spend some 10 days visiting the battlefields in Iraq 
without seeing major progress in every area. A combination of 
the surge, improved win and hold tactics, the tribal uprising in 
Anbar and other provinces, the Sadr ceasefire, and major 
advances in the use of IS&R have transformed the battle against 
Al Qaida in Iraq. If the US provides sustained support to the 
Iraqi government -- in security, governance, and development -- 
there is now a very real chance that Iraq will emerge as a secure and stable state. 
The attached briefing provides detailed graphs and maps taken from material provided to me 
during my visit to Iraq.  The briefing is an update on the situation throughout Iraq, and shows 
the trends over the past year. These graphs and maps measure major acts of violence, ethno-
sectarian violence, and trends in IED and other forms of attack. These same trends emerge 
from a detailed examination of what is happening in Baghdad, Anbar, and Central Iraq. They 
show the war is far from over, but the violence has been sharply reduced, and perhaps to the 
minimum levels possible until Iraq improves its governance and development and moves 
much further towards political accommodation

THE CNGR FINAL REPORT: THE BEST SHOT FOR A STRONGER, 
SUSTAINABLE RESERVE COMPONENT. Christine E. Wormuth. CSIS. February 1, 
2008   
 
The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves released its final report on January 31, 
2008. Making almost 100 recommendations to adapt and transform the National Guard and 
Reserves to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, the commission report is a sobering 
description of the health of America’s citizen soldiers, and a clear road map, that if 
implemented, points the way to a strong and viable Guard and Reserves in the future.  
  
While many of the problems the commission report describes and the recommendations it 
makes are not new, the commission breaks new ground in several areas and brings the full 
range of recommendations, old and new, into a single authoritative report that truly is “the 
most comprehensive, independent review of National Guard and Reserve forces in the past 60 
years.” The commission’s recommendations on what more the Defense Department needs to 
do to prepare for a catastrophic attack on the homeland are particularly important and should 
not be ignored.

THE AFGHAN-PAKISTAN WAR: THREAT DEVELOPMENTS. By Anthony 
Cordesman, Burke Chair in Strategy. Report. CSIS. January 31, 2008 
 
Despite continued violence, the threat in Afghanistan has not increased to the point where it 
can challenge NATO/ISAF forces in open combat, the US has made major gains in striking at 
the leadership of the various mix of hostile Islamist movements 
in the south, and similar gains have been scored against the more 
traditional Taliban leadership in the south. 
 
The attached briefing, however, provides a broader view of the 
rising level of violence in the country based on a visit to 
Afghanistan in late January 2008, and unclassified data from the 
UN, NATO/ISAF, and US sources in Afghanistan. It provides an 
analytic overview of threat developments that map and chart a growing overall threat in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.  
 
It shows that the more traditional Taliban structure under the Mullah Omar in the south 
remains a major problem, and that the mix of Taliban and other Islamist elements in the East 
has become far more sophisticated and cooperative during the course of 2007. Al Qa'ida 
influence over the Afghan groups has increased, and the combined role of Al Qa'ida and the 
emerging Pakistani Taliban has sharply increased in influence and in the territory over which 
it has de facto control.

U.S. AIR FORCE BOMBER MODERNIZATION PLANS: AN INDEPENDENT 
ASSESSMENT.  Clark A. Murdock. Center for Strategic & International Studies. 
January 25, 2008 
 
As a separate, standalone input to its ongoing work, IRIS Independent 
Research asked Clark Murdock, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies (CSIS), to provide a quick-turn, independent 
assessment from an “external perspective” of Air Force bomber 
modernization options. 
 
CSIS recruited a diverse group of subject-matter experts, including former 
senior Department of Defense officials, defense strategy and policy 
generalists, air power experts and former Air Force officers, and hosted two 
workshop luncheons. The workshop discussion was governed by Chatham 
House rules — all participants would be identified; direct quotes (both from oral and written 
statements) would be used in reporting workshop results; but no quote or viewpoint would be 
attributed to a particular participant. IRIS Independent Research produced a briefing that 
provided the basis for the workshop discussion.

INTEGRATING 21ST CENTURY DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE. 
Robert Andrews and Mark Kirk (cochairs); J. Stephen Morrison and Kathleen Hicks 
(project directors) CSIS. January 18, 2008 
 
In early 2007, CSIS launched an expert task force to examine the 
growing involvement of the Department of Defense as a direct p
of “non-traditional” security assistance, concentrated in 
counterterrorism, capacity building, stabilization and reconstruction, 
and humanitarian relief. The task force set out to shed light on what 
drives this trend, including the new global threat environment; assess 
what was happening at the same time in the diplomatic and 
developmental realms; evaluate DOD performance in conducting its 
expanded missions; and consider the impact of the Pentagon’s enlarged 
role on broader U.S. national security, foreign policy and development 
interests. From the outset, the task force sought to generate concrete, practical 
recommendations to Congress and the White House on reforms and legislation that will 
create a better and more sustainable balance between military and civilian tools.

General James L. Jones, USMC (Ret.), Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering. Center for the 
Study of The Presidency. Afghanistan Study Group Report. Second Edition. Release 
Date: January 30, 2008 
 
It is clear that one of the key challenges that the mission in A
now faces is the lack of a common strategic vision that will 
reinvigorate our efforts under unified attainable goals. This proce
to be done comprehensively – involving both military and civilian 
aspects of the mission as equals – and in a cooperative fashion among 
the U.S., NATO, the UN, the EU, and the Afghan government. The 
Afghanistan Compact should be the basis for any common strate
vision, and discussion should focus on developing strategies to achieve
that vision. 
 
The goal of the Afghanistan Study Group is to provide policy makers with key 
recommendations that will lead to a re-vitalization and re-doubling of the United States and 
international community’s commitment and effort in Afghanistan. The study group’s findings 
and proposals will be shared with U.S. government officials, Members of Congress, key 
officials in NATO and at the United Nations, and representatives of the governments of 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as other interested governments and parties.

CENTURY FOUNDATION (TCF)
 
RISING POWERS AND GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS. G. John Ikenberry, Thomas 
Wright, The Century Foundation, 2/6/2008   
   
The economic surge of large Asian countries is propelling a 
fundamental shift in global power relationships. But while power 
transitions in the past have been marked by often violent struggles 
between rising and declining powers, the post-1945 international order 
is substantially different—more open, institutionalized, consensual, and 
rule-based—allowing a twenty-first-century power transition to be 
accomplished peacefully and incrementally. As countries such as C
India, Russia, and Brazil seek a greater voice in the international order, 
however, the institutions underpinning the international order will ha
to adapt to accommodate the new realities. In this report, G. John 
Ikenberry and Thomas Wright consider how the United States might most strategically move 
to adapt such institutions as the United Nations Security Council, the Bretton Woods 
institutions, the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and the global trading order, as well as 
explore informal multilateral groupings, to engage the new powers.

THE RISE OF CHINA AND THE FUTURE OF THE WEST. Ikenberry, G. John. 
Foreign Affairs Vol. 87, No. 1, January-February 2008 AA08032  
  
Summary: China appears poised to overtake the United States as a world power, but the 
transition need not be a bloody one, according to Ikenberry, professor of politics and 
international affairs at Princeton University. China will face not a single power but the entire 
Western order of democratic capitalist states. That order, built around rules and market 
openness, creates the conditions for China and other rising powers to gain status and play a 
role in global governance. "The road to global power, in effect, runs through the Western 
order and its multilateral economic institutions," Ikenberry says. The coming power shift can 
occur peacefully and on terms favorable to the United States, but only by the United States 
reinforcing the Western order's system of global governance, first by reestablishing itself as 
its foremost supporter. Currently available online at

LEADING AFRICA. Stephanie Hanson, News Editor. Council on Foreign Relations. 
February 8, 2008 
 
South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya are considered sub-Saharan Africa’s anchor states. Each 
country is the financial and infrastructure hub of its subregion, and each has played a robust 
role in regional peace and security. The United States has supported these states with the 
expectation that each would foster stability among its neighbors. Yet with all three embroiled 
in pressing domestic issues, questions about the utility of this strategy abound. Some experts 
say the anchor states will continue to play an active role in pan-African issues. Others see a 
worrying leadership vacuum. While states like Ghana and Tanzania show promise, such mid-
sized countries have a hard time projecting influence beyond their immediate neighborhood. 
Experts agree the current situation bodes poorly for regional security issues and long-term 
economic growth, but are sharply divided on what kind of policy the United States should 
pursue on the continent.

After French President Nicolas Sarkozy's and Ger-man Chancellor Angela 
Merkel's successful visits to Washington, D.C., U.S. policymakers might be 
for-given for thinking that U.S. strategic interests are now in safe hands in 
continental Europe. However, this optimism discounts the enormous threat

If the President and Congress make the right decisions over the next 10 years, 
America will have the optimal military to keep the nation safe, free, and 
prosperous while responding to the emerging national security challenges of 
the 21st century. Achieving the ideal composition and capabilities of U.S. 
military forces will require: 
 
 Building a robust complement of capabilities for the spectrum of missions the 
armed forces will face,  
• Ensuring adequate funding for ongoing operations,  
• Maintaining a trained and ready all-volunteer force,  
• Preparing for the future, and  
• Fundamentally reforming manpower and procure-ment policies.

THE WEST MUST BACK FULL INDEPENDENCE FOR KOSOVO. By Nile Gardiner, 
Ph.D. and Sally McNamara. WebMemo #1818. The Heritage Foundation. February 15, 
2008 
 
In 1998 and 1999, Serbia waged a barbaric campaign of ethnic cleansing against ethnic 
Albanians that left more than 10,000 people dead. It was only the U.S.-British-led NATO 
intervention that prevented thousands more from being slaughtered by Slobodan Milosevic's 
dictatorship, and 16,000 Allied troops remain in the province today. 
 
More than 90 percent of Kosovo's 2.1 million residents are ethnic Albanians; Serbs make up a 
tiny minority. There is no realistic alternative to independence for the province, a political 
reality that both Serbia and Russia must accept. As former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher warned in a speech in 1999, "[I]t would be both cruel and stupid to expect the 
Albanian Kosovans now to return to live under any form of Serbian rule."

VISA POLICY AND TRANSPORTATION SECURITY: ENSURING THE RIGHT 
BALANCE. By Sally McNamara. WebMemo #1813. The Heritage Foundation. February 
13, 2008 
 
 Visa policy is a strategic public policy that America must get right. It 
is a critical tool for promoting American public diplomacy, economic 
growth, and international alliance-building. 
 
The exclusion of many of America's closest Central and Eastern 
European allies from the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has 
undoubtedly been an obstacle to building enduring bilateral alliances 
with European nations. In late 2007, Congress passed legislation 
allowing for expansion of the VWP, and its implementation must now 
make progress. 
 
Policymakers must implement these visa reforms along with wider reforms of transportation 
security policy. The devastation of 9/11 looms large, and it is incumbent on nations on both 
sides of the Atlantic to ensure that travel is safe as well as open. However, it is equally 
incumbent on nations to ensure that new policies genuinely contribute to increased security 
and are formulated in the spirit of transatlantic cooperation, without European Union 
obstructionism.

DEATH OF A TERRORIST: IMAD MUGNIYAH. By James Phillips. WebMemo #1815

 Yesterday's reported death of the terrorist mastermind Imad M
if true, is a major blow to the Hezbollah organization, its backers in 
Iran and Syria, and other terrorist groups who have cooperated 
Hezbollah or Iran, often working through Mugniyah. He was involved 
in many of the most lethal and high-profile terrorist attacks in the 
Middle East and elsewhere over the past 25 years. His death, which 
may have been the outcome of an Israeli counter-terrorist operation, is 
an important victory in the global struggle against terrorism.

POLITICAL MURDER IN CENTRAL ASIA: NO TIME TO END UZBEKISTAN’S 
ISOLATION. Asia Briefing N°76.ICG, 14 February 2008  
 
There are strong indications that Uzbek security forces murdered one of 
Kyrgyzstan’s most prominent journalists, Alisher Saipov, in October 2007 
during the build-up to Uzbekistan’s end of year presidential elections, most 
likely because of his involvement in Erk (Freedom), a leading exile opposition 
party. If this is the case, it would appear that the security organs, which are the 
key to keeping President Islam Karimov in power, are increasingly willing to 
move against any perceived danger, even if it involves pre-emptive strikes in 
foreign territory. This may be a sign not only of the ruthlessness of the regime 
but also of its increasing fragility. At the least it underlines the need for the U.S. 
and the European Union (EU) to resist the temptation to respond to Karimov’s 
dubious December 2007 re-election with efforts at re-engagement, in the apparent hope of 
regaining or retaining military bases for Afghanistan operations or of outflanking Russia.

IRAQ’S CIVIL WAR, THE SADRISTS AND THE SURGE. Middle East Report N°72. 
ICG. 7 February 2008  
 
The dramatic decline in bloodshed in Iraq – at least until last week’s 
terrible market bombings in Baghdad – is largely due to Muqtada al-
Sadr’s August 2007 unilateral ceasefire. Made under heavy U.S. and 
Iraqi pressure and as a result of growing discontent from his own Shiite 
base, Muqtada’s decision to curb his unruly movement was a positive 
step. But the situation remains highly fragile and potentially reversible. If 
the U.S. and others seek to press their advantage and deal the Sadrists a 
mortal blow, these gains are likely to be squandered, with Iraq 
experiencing yet another explosion of violence. The need is instead to 
work at converting Muqtada’s unilateral measure into a more 
comprehensive multilateral ceasefire that can create conditions for the movement to evolve 
into a fully legitimate political actor.

AFGHANISTAN: THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL RESOLVE. Asia Report N°145. 
ICG. 6 February 2008  
 
Afghanistan is not lost but the signs are not good. Its growing insurgency reflects a collective 
failure to tackle the root causes of violence. Six years after the Taliban’s ouster, the 
international community lacks a common diagnosis of what is needed to stabilise the country 
as well as a common set of objectives. Long-term improvement of institutions is vital for both 
state building and counter-insurgency, but without a more strategic approach, the increased 
attention and resources now directed at quelling the conflict could even prove 
counterproductive by furthering a tendency to seek quick fixes. Growing tensions over

TERRORISM: WHAT’S COMING. The Mutating Threat. Introduction by Brian 
Michael Jenkins. Edited by James O Ellis III. Memorial Institute for the Prevention of 
Terrorism (MIPT),  2007 
 
Terrorists do not periodically descend upon the planet as 
extraterrestrials. Terrorism has its own natural history, shaped by 
circumstances and events. New generations draw from and build upon 
the ideologies and tactics of previous generations. 
Contemporary international terrorism as we define it today emerged in 
the late 1960s from a confluence of political circumstances and 
technological developments. Its practitioners shared no common cause 
beyond frustration borne of failure.

AFTER THE SURGE: NEXT STEPS IN IRAQ? By Judith S. Yaphe. Strategic Forum 
#230. NDU. February 2008 
 
To build on the achievements of the military surge, the United States 
must have four priorities. First, Washington must continue to support 
the elected government in Baghdad, helping it to establish its authority 
through the consensual exercise of power. Second, the United States 
must encourage provincial elections as a vehicle for political reform and 
for loosening the hold of sectarian loyalty upon the political process. 
Third, efforts to build a truly national Iraqi military force recruited from 
all sectors of the population must be reinforced. Fourth, tangible 
cooperation between Iraq and its neighbors on border security must be 
achieved in order to reduce the flow of money and foreign fighters that

stokes the insurgencies. In taking these steps, the United States must weigh its tactical 
choices carefully, not only avoiding stances on specific issues that tilt too far to any one side 
but also pressing for an end to factional control of government ministries.

SO MANY ZEBRAS, SO LITTLE TIME: ECOLOGICAL MODELS AND 
COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS. By Mark D. Drapeau, Peyton C. Hurley, and 
Robert E. Armstrong. NDU. Defense Horizons Number 62, February 2008 
 
While not a perfect metaphor, it is striking that these quantitative 
ecology models greatly resemble behavioral interactions during 
counterinsurgency operations. While a predator-prey model alone may 
be too simplistic to fully describe counterinsurgency, there are more 
detailed ecological models of competition that better capture the 
essence of the problem. 
 
The purpose of this paper is not to provide definitive solutions, but to 
suggest a framework for other researchers to adapt and expand upon. 
Indeed, many of the models discussed are common to both ecologists 
and economists. The goals of both types of modeling are similar: maximizing profits in terms 
of food or money at the least risk—death or bankruptcy. 
 
From our preliminary work on the possible applications of ecology to counterinsurgency, we 
hope that others more adept at the use of these quantitative models will make significant 
contributions to the area of predictive ability in combating

CYBER INFLUENCE AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. By Franklin D. Kramer 
and Larry Wentz. NDU. Defense Horizons Number 61, January 2008 
 
Cyber influence is an ongoing source of power in the international security 
arena. Although the United States has an enormous cyber information 
capacity, its cyber influence is not proportional to that capacity. Impediments 
to American cyber influence include the vastness and complexity of the 
international information environment, multiplicity of cultures and differing 
audiences to which communications must be addressed, extensiveness and 
significance of contending or alternative messages, and complexity and 
importance of using appropriate influential messengers and message 
mechanisms. 
 
Enhancing the influence of the United States in cyberspace will require a multifaceted 
strategy that differentiates the circumstances of the messages, key places of delivery, and 
sophistication with which messages are created and delivered, with particular focus on 
channels and messengers.

WAR BY OTHER MEANS -- BUILDING COMPLETE AND BALANCED 
CAPABILITIES FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY. By: David C. Gompert, John Gordon, 
IV, Adam Grissom, David R. Frelinger, Seth G. Jones, Martin C. Libicki, Edward 
O'Connell, Brooke K. Stearns, Robert E. Hunter. RAND Counterinsurgency Study -- 
Final Report. February 2008 
 
The difficulties encountered by the United States in securing Iraq and 
Afghanistan despite years of effort and staggering costs raises the central 
question of the RAND Counterinsurgency Study: How should the United 
States improve its capabilities to counter insurgencies, particularly those 
that are heavily influenced by transnational terrorist movements and thus 
linked into a global jihadist network? This capstone volume to the study 
draws on other reports in the series as well as an examination of 89 
insurgencies since World War II, an analysis of the new challenges posed 
by what is becoming known as global insurgency, and many of the 
lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report’s recommendations 
are based on the premise that counterinsurgency (COIN) is a contest for the allegiance of a 
nation’s population; victory over jihadist insurgency consists not of merely winning a war 
against terrorists but of persuading Islamic populations to choose legitimate government and 
reject violent religious tyranny. The authors evaluate three types of COIN capabilities: civil 
capabilities to help weak states improve their political and economic performance; 
informational and cognitive capabilities to enable better governance and improve COIN 
decisionmaking; and security capabilities to protect people and infrastructure and to weaken 
insurgent forces. Gompert and Gordon warn that U.S. capabilities are deficient in several

critical areas but also emphasize that U.S. allies and international organizations can provide 
capabilities that the United States currently cannot. The authors conclude by outlining the 
investments, organizational changes within the federal government and the military, and 
international arrangements that the United States should pursue to improve its COIN 
capabilities.

UNGOVERNED TERRITORIES. By: Angel Rabasa. RAND. February 2008 
 
Testimony presented before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 
Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on February 14, 2008. 
Ungoverned territories have always been a troublesome feature of the international landscape. 
They generate all manner of security problems, such as civil conflict and humanitarian crises, 
arms and drug smuggling, piracy, and refugee flows. They threaten regional stability and 
security and generate demands on scarce military resources. Many of the crises that have 
required intervention by U.S. or international forces since the end of the Cold War were 
produced by the collapse or absence of state authority. Nevertheless, with the exception of 
humanitarian crises, ungoverned territories were of relatively little interest to the U.S. 
national security community, unless, like the coca-growing areas of South America during 
the 1990s “war on drugs,” they generated problems for the United States that required some 
degree of involvement.

IMPROVING STRATEGIC PLANNING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. By: 
Paul K. Davis, Russell D. Shaver, Justin Beck. RAND. February 2008 
 
The Department of Defense (DoD) works continuously to improve its strategic planning for 
future forces, their capabilities, and their readiness. An important objective of this planning is 
confronting and managing diverse risks. Considerable RAND research has been devoted to 
these topics, including in-depth work on what has come to be called capabilities-based 
planning. In our view, good capabilities-based planning encourages a “FAR strategy,” i.e., a 
strategy assuring capabilities that are flexible (suitable for different strategic or military 
purposes), adaptive (modifiable for different circumstances), and robust (resistant or resilient 
to negative events). 
Capabilities-based planning is facilitated by portfolio analysis, the goal of which is to invest 
in a mix (a portfolio) of capabilities that, while perhaps not the best for any single objective, 
is effective for as broad a range of possibilities as is feasible under the budget. Such a 
portfolio is consistent with a FAR strategy

SMALL ARMS SURVEY
 
CONVENTIONAL AMMUNITION IN SURPLUS: A REFERENCE GUIDE. Edited by 
James Bevan. Small Arms Survey. January 2008. 
 
Unstable and ineffectively secured accumulations of surplus 
conventional ammunition pose a risk to public safety, a security threat to 
societies, and, ultimately, a challenge to the state’s monopoly on the use 
of force. Surplus is a problem in its own right, but one that must be 
understood as part of a wider set of safety and security risks that are 
inherent to national stockpiling of conventional ammunition. 
 
Unlike weapons, many of the components in ammunition are designed to 
detonate or combust. Propellants, primers, and explosives are inherently 
unstable and require comprehensive physical and chemical surveillance. 
Managing them requires thorough planning and attention to their safe storage, handling, 
transportation, and disposal. A failure to institute these necessary management practices can 
have severe consequences. Ammunition that is allowed to become unstable or is mishandled 
may ignite, explode, or contaminate the environment. Because stockpiles of conventional 
ammunition often run into thousands of tonnes, any one of these occurrences can lead to 
large-scale loss of life, drastic impacts on local economies, and the destruction of high-value 
military assets. Stockpiles of large calibre conventional ammunition and hazardous toxic 
components, such as liquid rocket fuel, represent serious threats in this regard. Conventional 
ammunition is also in high demand on the illicit market. It is a commodity that has many 
applications, ranging from misuse in illegal firearms to unlawful mining and fishing.

STANLEY FOUNDATION
 
US POLICY OPTIONS TOWARD PAKISTAN: A PRINCIPLED AND REALISTIC 
APPROACH. Owen Bennett-Jones. Policy Analysis Brief. Stanley Foundation. February 
2008 
 
The United States is providing massive quantities of aid to Pakistan—as much 
as $20 billion since 9/11. This has enabled Pakistan to go through a period of 
lavish military spending, but there have nonetheless been serious reverses both 
in the military battle against the radical Islamists and in the transition to 
democracy. It is tempting for US policymakers to react to these developments 
by switching support from the army to civilian politicians. The United States, 
however, should not forget that whatever form of government exists in 
Pakistan, the army, for good or ill, will continue to be a major force in 
Pakistani society for many years to come. Given the widespread agreement 
that the war on terror is going to last at least 20 years, the United States should 
think about longer-term policies. With that perspective in mind, the goal of persuading 
Pakistanis to turn their backs on radical Islam, alongside democracy promotion, can best be 
achieved by spending the bulk of the US aid on education and promotion of the rule of law.

THE NORTH KOREAN BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM. By Dr. Daniel A. Pinkston. 
Monograph, Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War College. February 25, 2008 
 
 Alert me when similar studies are published North Korea’s nuclear 
weapons and ballistic missile programs have drawn international 
attention for years. In the early 1960s, Pyongyang began to pursue the 
capability to produce advanced weapons systems, including rockets 
and missiles. However, foreign assistance and technology, particularly 
from China and the Soviet Union, were instrumental in the acquisition 
of these capabilities. The ballistic missile inventory now totals about 
800 road-mobile missiles, including about 200 Nodong missiles that 
could strike Japan. In April 2007, North Korea for the first time 
displayed two new missiles: a short-range tactical missile that poses a 
threat to Seoul and U.S. Forces in South Korea, and an intermediate-range missile that could 
potentially strike Guam. Although North Korea has not demonstrated the ability to produce a 
nuclear warhead package for its missiles, its missiles are believed to be capable of delivering 
chemical and possibly biological munitions. North Korean media and government officials 
claim the country needs a nuclear deterrent to cope with the “hostile policy of the United 
States,” but Pyongyang has never officially abandoned its objective of “completing the 
revolution in the south.” Little is known about North Korean military doctrine and the role of 
its ballistic missiles, but National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Ch?ng-il has ultimate 
authority over their disposition.

DISSENT AND STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP OF THE MILITARY PROFESSIONS. By 
Dr. Don M. Snider. Monograph. Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War College. 
February 19, 2008 
 
One of the central difficulties to a right understanding of American 
civil-military relations is the nature of the U.S. military. Are our armed 
forces just obedient bureaucracies like most of the Executive branch, or 
are they vocational professions granted significant autonomy and a 
unique role in these relationships because of their expert knowledge 
and their expertise to apply it in the defense of America? To large 
measure, the answer to this question should determine the behavior of 
the strategic leaders of these professions, including the uncommon 
behavior of public dissent. Using the “Revolt of the Generals” in 2006 
as stimulus, the author develops from the study of military professions 
the critical trust relationships that should have informed their individual decisions to dissent. 
After doing so, he makes recommendations for the restoration of the professions’ ethic in this 
critical area of behavior by the senior officers who are the professions’ strategic leaders.

DEVELOPING STRATEGIC LEADERS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. By Dr. Jeffrey D. 
McCausland. Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War College. February 08, 2008 
 
Emerging analysis of the American interagency and intergovernmental 
processes has underscored the nation’s inability to respond effectively 
and coherently to contemporary national security demands. 
Modifications to various organizations and the overall interagency 
process have been recommended. These are clearly required, but there 
has not been sufficient attention focused on the nonmilitary human 
capital required to meet the challenges of the 21st century. S
the Federal Government lacks a comprehensive process to ensure the 
recruitment, development, and retention of leaders capable of 
effectively integrating the contributions of specialized government 
agencies on behalf of larger national security interests. This new security environment 
requires people who are not only substantively qualified and knowledgeable of policy issues, 
but also possess the leadership abilities to direct large complex organizations.

TRANSFORMING TO EFFECTS-BASED OPERATIONS: LESSONS FROM THE 
UNITED KINGDOM EXPERIENCE. By Dr. Andrew M. Dorman. Monograph. 
Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War College. January 30, 2008  
 
 The author examines the extent to which the United Kingdom (UK) 
has transitioned to effects-based operations to ascertain: (1) Areas 
where the U.S. Army could draw lessons from UK policies; (2) Areas 
where the U.S. Army and the British Ministry of Defence could 
develop integrated or complementary approaches and doctrines 
towards transformation for future alliance/coalition operations; and (3) 
Implications for the U.S. Army for working with the UK. This 
monograph is subdivided into four parts. Section 1 is a review of the 
evolution of British defence policy since the end of the Cold War and 
evaluates the degree to which it has adopted an effects based approach. 
Section 2 examines the British operational experience since the end of the Cold War 
including an analysis of the lessons learned and its experiences of working with allies. 
Section 3 analyses the UK’s capability development through its doctrine and acquisition 
strategies. Section 4 evaluates the implications of these findings for the U.S. Army and makes 
17 main recommendations.

DEVELOPMENT AND REFORM OF THE IRAQI POLICE FORCES. By Lieutenant 
Colonel Tony Pfaff. Letort Papers. Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War College.  
January 25, 2008  
 
Despite 4 years of millions of dollars in aid, equipment, education, and 
advisors, Iraqi police force development lags far behind the military. 
Numerous reasons are offered to account for this gap: corrupt practices 
left over from the previous regime, infiltration by militias, weak 
leadership, competition by better armed and organized criminal and 
militant groups, and so on. However, the military is also subject to 
these same influences, thus none of these explanations by themselves 
or in combination are satisfactory. The author argues that the poor 
political and security environment impacts social, political, and c
factors in ways that are predictable, understandable, and, with external 
help, resolvable. The author offers valuable insights into the creation of such programs as 
well as a number of policies and practices advisors may adopt to best facilitate the creation o
a just and effective Iraqi police force.

WOMEN IN COMBAT COMPENDIUM. By Colonel Michele M. Putko, Dr. Douglas V. 
Johnson, II. Student (Carlisle) Papers. Strategic Studies Institute. U.S. Army War 
College. January 24, 2008 
 
These facts involving women in combat are: Women comprise approximately 
15 percent of the U.S. Army today, and as of September 2007, 70 Army 
women have been killed and a significantly larger number wounded; the 
American public is vaguely aware of this state of affairs and has raised no 
outcry. The nature of the current battlefield makes it impossible to apply the 
existing rules for excluding women from combat without serious reduction in 
combat capabilities, degrading the professional development and thus status of 
women, and producing a potentially serious reduction in overall readiness. 
Two major conclusions are reached: (1) the nature of combat for the U.S. 
Army has changed, and the existing rules governing the employment of 
women do not fit this new situation; and (2) there is not the slightest doubt that women can 
perform their assigned duties in the combat zone, including engaging in combat actions 
essential to their personal and unit’s self-defense, with skill and valor equal to their male 
comrades.

Another kind of war within the context of a “clash of civilizations” is 
being waged in various parts o f the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, the 
Middle East, and elsewhere around the world today. Some of the main 
protagonists are those who have come to be designated as first-second-, 
and third-generation street gangs, as well as their various possible allies 
such as traditional Transnational Criminal Organizations. In this new 
type of war, national security and sovereignty of affected countries is 
being impinged every day, and gangs’ illicit commercial motives are, in 
fact, becoming an ominous political agenda.

RELIGION IN WORLD AFFAIRS: ITS ROLE IN CONFLICT AND PEACE. David 
Smock. USIP Special Report No. 201. February 2008 
 
 In recent decades, religion has assumed unusual prominence in 
international affairs. A recent article in The Economist asserts that, if 
there ever was a global drift toward secularism, it has been halted and 
probably reversed. In the article, Philip Jenkins, a noted scholar from 
Pennsylvania State University, predicts that when historians look back 
at this century they will see religion as "the prime animating and 
destructive force in human affairs, guiding attitudes to political liberty 
and obligation, concepts of nationhood and, of course, conflicts and 
wars." The article then cites statistics from a public opinion survey in 
Nigeria demonstrating that Nigerians believe religion to be more 
central to their identity than nationality. Nigerians are thus more likely to identify themselves 
first and foremost as Christians or Muslims rather than as Nigerians. The horrendous events 
of September 11, the conflagration in Iraq, and the aggressive assertiveness of quasi-
theocratic Iran only confirm in the popular mind that religion lies behind much of 
contemporary international conflict.

In this volatile election season in Pakistan, attention is once again turning 
toward Pakistani national identity, security, and foreign policy. To better 
assess the situation, USIP and WorldPublicOpinion.org conducted a joint 
public opinion survey of urban Pakistanis on a wide array of compelling 
policy questions.

FACING THE ABYSS: LEBANON'S DEADLY POLITICAL STALEMATE. By Mona 
Yacoubian. USIPeace Briefing. February 2008 
 
As the third anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri 
approaches, Lebanon is witnessing its worst crisis since the 15-year civil war. Hariri’s 
February 14th assassination—widely suspected to have been orchestrated by Syria—enraged 
the Lebanese who took to the streets one month later, demanding the withdrawal of Syrian 
troops. Dubbed the Cedar Revolution, this mass protest movement succeeded in ending 
nearly 30 years of Syrian military occupation. It was to have ushered in a new era of 
democracy. Instead, Lebanon has suffered through bombings, assassinations, war between 
Hezbollah and Israel, and bouts of sectarian violence. 
 
Today, Lebanon is plagued by a protracted political stalemate between a rump government 
led by the anti-Syrian March 14th coalition (inheritors of the Cedar Revolution) and the 
Hezbollah-led opposition. This dangerous deadlock has propelled Lebanon once again toward

the abyss of civil war. Despite intensive Arab and European mediation efforts, a political 
compromise does not appear imminent.1 Rather, Lebanon seems poised to endure weeks, if 
not months, of continued paralysis and violence. This USIPeace Briefing examines some of 
the key issues underlying Lebanon’s current political turmoil.

HOW WE MISSED THE STORY: OSAMA BIN LADEN, THE TALIBAN, AND THE 
HIJACKING OF AFGHANISTAN. Roy Gutman. On-line Press Kit. USIP. January 2008 
 
Focusing principally on events in Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s, Gutman 
argues that U.S. foreign policy had essentially died. According to Gutman, the 
U.S. government categorization of bin Laden’s murderous assaults prior to 9/11 
as "terrorism" was not so much an intelligence or military failure but rather a 
strategic failure of U.S. foreign policy—a failure that penetrated every level of 
the U.S. foreign affairs hierarchy. Two presidents, greater law enforcement 
including the CIA and the FBI, upper level political appointees, experts, and 
skilled civil servants relied on quick-fix, counter-terrorism tactics to end the 
threats from Osama bin Laden. Assuming that the public would not support a 
long-term, broad spectrum approach, the government opted to develop a 
counter-terror policy—when a more comprehensive foreign policy was needed—and 
inadvertently fueled the very fire it was trying to fight.

THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR-EAST POLICY
 
TIMELY REMINDER OF IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. By Matthew 
Levitt and Michael Jacobson. PolicyWatch #1345. The Washington Institute for Near-
East Policy. February 22, 2008 
 
Over the past several years, Iran's nuclear activities have commanded the attention of the 
international community. But the recent assassination of Hizballah foreign operations chief 
Imad Mughniyeh is a reminder that Iran has been -- and continues to be -- a key player in 
global terrorism, as its explicit sponsorship of Hizballah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad (PIJ) demonstrates. Moreover, a recent terrorism case in Bahrain suggests that Iran's 
assistance to al-Qaeda operatives may still be continuing today, echoing the regime's implicit 
support of the group in the past.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND ISRAEL'S QUALITATIVE MILITARY EDGE: THE 
NEED FOR A COMMON VISION. William Wunderle and Andre Briere. Policy Focus 
#80. The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. January 2008 
 
The U.S. commitment to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge 
(QME) -- that is, the technological, tactical, and other advantages that 
allow it to deter numerically superior adversaries -- is a longstanding 
tradition that every president since Lyndon Johnson has reiterated. 
Today, however, Israel's relations with Arab countries are more 
complicated, and some moderate Arab states have even become 
strategically aligned with Israel due to Iran's growing regional 
ambitions and nuclear activities. How does this new regional calculus 
affect American military aid to both Israel and Arab states? And how 
can Washington advance U.S. strategic needs in the Middle East while 
still supporting its diverse allies?

AUTUMN OF DECISIONS: A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR AMERICAN 
ENGAGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Conference Proceedings. The Washington 
Institute for Near-East Policy. 2008 
 
The 2007 Weinberg Founders Conference explored a number of c
issues, with an eye toward the overall direction of U.S. Middle East 
policy as the Bush administration enters its final year in office. In 
keynote plenary sessions and breakout seminars, and over coffee in the 
hallways, a select group of American and international officials, 
experts, diplomats, and journalists joined members of the Institute's 
Board of Trustees in a weekend of discussion and debate on the "
in Iraq, political struggles in Lebanon, peacemaking initiatives on the 
Arab-Israeli front, the looming nuclear standoff with Iran, and many 
other issues. In addition, the conference featured two very special
events: a keynote address by Vice President Richard Cheney, and the launching of The 
Washington Institute Book Prize, featuring a discussion between Bob Woodward, Kanan

ARTICLES FROM U.S. JOURNALS 
 
THE NEXUS OF GLOBALIZATION AND NEXT-GENERATION 
NONPROLIFERATION: TAPPING THE POWER OF MARKET-BASED 
SOLUTIONS. Luongo, Kenneth; Williams, Isabelle. Nonproliferation Review vol. 14, no. 
3, November 2007, pp. 459-473 AA08010  
  
Summary: The authors examine the problem that advanced biological and nuclear 
technology, once the exclusive province of states, now may pass readily to non-state actors 
putting economic as well as civilian and military targets at risk. They urge new creative 
thinking to develop a stronger more flexible next-generation nonproliferation strategy and 
one that might combine targeted sanctions, political engagement and focused economic 
incentives so as to “begin the important process of moderating government behavior by 
empowering the private sector.” While containing the spread of technologies needed to 
produce fissile materials and securing fissile material stockpiles remain at the heart of the 
nuclear proliferation challenge, they also cite the additional challenge of biological 
proliferation. They note inadequate biotechnology industry oversight and the absence of 
standardized international rules for biosecurity, especially in Asia. They advocate finding 
ways to draw the commercial sector into identifying solutions, since this sector has so much 
at risk financially should a nuclear or biological disaster occur. After examining case studies 
of formal and informal nonproliferation efforts in Russia, Libya, Iran and North Korea, the 
authors say the international community is at a critical nonproliferation juncture and it must 
enlist the full range of stakeholders. A successful future strategy must integrate economic, 
political and technological issues drawing on key arms control treaties as well as modern ad 
hoc mechanisms “emphasizing cooperation, flexibility and market-based solutions.”
