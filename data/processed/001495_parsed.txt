2000 SAFENET REVIEW 
 
 
This season was the inaugural year for SAFENET.  The goal of the program is to 
function as a collector of raw data to be used in monitoring fire safety trends.  At the 
same time, SAFENET provides a means of sharing safety information throughout the 
fire community and, hopefully, helps facilitate corrective actions. 
 
Between the beginning of the year and the first of October, 68 SAFENETS were filed.  
Although this is a relatively low number for a fire season of this magnitude, we are still 
encouraged by this first year result.  Because of the geographical and agency diversity 
of the filings, this can be considered a representative sample of the wildfire community. 
This report summarizes the SAFENETS by reporting agency, contributing factors, 
jurisdiction, incident type, incident activity, stage of incident, and management level of 
the fire.

Of the reports filed, seven of them were BIA, twenty-three by the BLM, seven by the 
NPS, twenty-four by the USFS, and eight by other agencies, predominantly state. 
 
 
 
Contributing Factors 
 
SAFENET categorizes each response into 
one of nine contributing factors; 
communication, human factors, performance, 
fatigue, equipment, fire behavior, 
environmental, situational awareness, or 
other.  The results are as follows.

Communication 
 
Clearly the greatest concern in this group of reports is communication.  Of the 68 
SAFENETS reviewed, 32 report "problems with communication" as being the major 
factor in terms of a health and safety concern.  Of these, 21 identify a breakdown in the 
transfer of information.  The majority of the respondents cited "no briefing" as the 
biggest communication problem. 
 
 
The following summations are taken 
from the SAFENETS, and describe the 
relevant issue: 
• no field briefing prior to firing 
operation 
• no briefing - frequency changes 
not communicated 
• lack of briefing 
• briefing not given 
• no overhead communication w/IC 
• poor communication w/IC 
• crews not receiving information 
• about fire status 
• lack of info, no knowledge of   nearby burn-out operation 
• no briefing, no frequency assignments 
• no overhead communication 
 
• no briefing on arrival  
• lack of fire info being communicated 
• briefing with old, outdate information, no fire weather  
• briefing not given, organization not identified 
• crews not notified of aerial seeding operation during rehab 
• need better communication between ground crews and air ops 
• good air to ground comm between pilot and ground person on site required 
• different agencies working in USA should be briefed on procedures for heli ops 
• no briefing until told to receive one, no manifest 
• burning out under module w/out any warning/communication  
• no lookouts, lack of communication, overhead fatigued, upslope wind, slop-over 
 
9 reports identify a problem with communication as it relates to frequency and use.  The 
majority of these are specific to aviation operations and of the aviation problems, 4 of 
them were specific to flight-following interferences. 
• helicopter drops without crew notification - crew nearly hit with snag 
• flight-following frequency being used by many other operations 
• paging and flight-following activities on same frequency 
• flight-following interfered with by paging on same frequency 
• flight following and dispatch of resources on same frequency

• no comm between ground crews & helicopters doing bucket work. 
• helicopter drops without ground contact 
• additional radios with approved incident frequencies would aid

• frequency coordination 
 
 
9 reports identify communication problems of other varieties. 
• a need for temporary repeaters 
• 3&4 relays 
• fire operations using same channel as LE, SAR, Medivac etc... 
• not enough repeaters 
• no personnel in dispatch during fire operations 
• crew boss unable to make radio contact during dangerous situation 
• bad communication - crew boss unable to make contact 
• delayed medical attention 
• sent drivers out w/out radios (gsul) didn't have enough on incident

•

• 
DIVS(t) should not have been involved in burnout decision & failed to notify 
• 
Lack of discipline, lack of screening, failure to deal with a situation  
 
 
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS - 31 
All but 1 have been identified in other contributing factors.  Having no briefing, 
and the lack of command structure were the majority.  The only report that identifying 
situational awareness as the primary issue, was the grizzly bear near spike camp. 
 
 
 
FIRE BEHAVIOR - 18 
Only 2 SAFENETS identify a situation where the safety and health issue was 
directly related to fire behavior.  Both were fire behavior problems caused with wind 
changes.  Several report fire behavior not being communicated to crews, and those are 
identified in the communications section. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL- 13 
There were no specific environmental causes outside the human factors realm.
