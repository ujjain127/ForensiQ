SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE 
 
The Papers of James P. Mitchell span the years 1953 through 1964. However, the bulk of the 
papers, consisting of correspondence, memoranda, notes, speeches, reports, printed and near-
print materials, invitations, and other items, pertain to Mr. Mitchell’s career as Secretary of the 
Department of Labor, October 1953 through January 1961. 
 
James Mitchell was appointed Secretary of Labor on October 8, 1953, after having served the 
Eisenhower Administration as Assistant Secretary of the Army for six months. The Cabinet 
appointment came when President Eisenhower’s first Labor Secretary, Martin P. Durkin, former 
president of the AFL Plumbers’ Union, resigned to protest what he felt was a failure by the 
Administration to carry out an agreement to support changes in the Taft-Hartley law. Mitchell, a 
fifty-two-year-old lifelong Republican who had never been a union member, brought to the 
position the background of a business executive, and was the first personnel and industrial 
relations expert to hold the post. 
 
Labor leaders expressed mixed reactions concerning Mitchell’s appointment: Al Hayes, 
president of the International Association of Machinists, commented, “Incredible...now even the 
Department of Labor has been turned over to big business;” Walter P. Reuther, president of the 
CIO, felt Mitchell had “a good reputation among the labor people” and promised his union 
would extend the secretary “every cooperation;” and George Meany, president of the AFL and a 
supporter of Martin Durkin, withheld comment. President Eisenhower commented that the new 
secretary was “a man whose interest is in people and not merely the economic processes of the 
country.” (These quotations are taken from materials in the James P. Mitchell Papers, Secretary 
of Labor Series, Articles about the Secretary.) 
 
Upon assuming his post, Secretary Mitchell was confronted with a poorly-managed Department 
of Labor, with its numerous bureaus and offices isolated from one another and from the Office of 
the Secretary. Mitchell immediately invited candid comments on the workings of the department 
and introduced regular and open assemblies with all employees to keep them informed of the 
activities of the various branches. The secretary recognized merit within his department and 
encouraged up-grading of civil servants rather than bringing in numerous political appointees as 
the department continued to grow in size and operation. By 1956 the Department of Labor had a 
staff which had increased to over 6,400 members and a budget that had more than doubled since 
1950 (from $223,000,000 to $468,000,000). 
 
Secretary Mitchell approached his job with the idea that the Labor Department should serve the 
public in general -- that is, everyone who worked and not just organized labor. Throughout the 
Eisenhower Administration he endeavored to promote improved labor-management relations, 
believing that the two should work together as partners. Mitchell, who recognized collective 
bargaining as a permanent fixture in American labor, felt that unions must live up to their 
contracts while employers must in turn accept unions as a challenge to the effectiveness of their 
personnel policies. At the center of Mitchell’s approach to solving labor-management differences 
was a call for understanding, common sense, and enlightened self-interest. He asked business to 
curtail inflationary profit-taking and labor to moderate wage demands. 
 
It was always Secretary Mitchell’s belief that the Eisenhower Administration could win the 
confidence and support of traditionally Democratic American labor. To this end he spent great 
time and energy addressing labor groups of every size and in every locale. During the 1956 
campaign he was one of the Administration’s most vigorous campaigners and a staunch defender 
of the Eisenhower record. His efforts probably helped Eisenhower carry 48% of the union vote 
in 1956 (compared to only 39% in the 1952 election) and 65% of the nonunion labor vote. 
(Thomson, Charles A. H. and Frances M. Shattuck, The 1956 Presidential Campaign. The 
Brookings Institute, Washington, D.C., 1960.) 
 
In December 1956 the long-awaited reunification of labor occurred when the AFL and CIO, 
which had been separate labor federations since 1935, merged to form the AFL-CIO. Although 
Mitchell was generally regarded by labor as being pro-business, he was still able to maintain 
cordial relations with the top labor leaders in the country. He opposed, as did President 
Eisenhower, a federal right-to-work law and the attempt to bring unions within the scope of anti-
trust legislation. He did not favor repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, but felt it needed extensive 
revision. He campaigned for improved local labor legislation, believing that the states rather than 
the federal government should be responsible for unemployment and workman’s compensation 
programs. Under Mitchell the Labor Department served the states as a clearing house of 
information about state labor laws and labor regulations. Due largely to his efforts, in 1955 forty-
two states improved their workmen’s compensation legislation and thirty-eight states increased 
or extended unemployment compensation. The Department of Labor also worked to extend the 
coverage of state and federal minimum wage laws, and during the Eisenhower Administration 
the general minimum wage was increased from $.75 per hour to $1.00. To insure salary 
increases, the department cracked down on contractors not paying wages guaranteed in 
government contracts. 
 
Another concern of Secretary Mitchell was the shortage of skilled laborers and what was termed 
the “evaporating manpower pool.” To ease this shortage the Labor Department instituted vast 
programs in vocational education, apprenticeships and on-the-job training. Also, the department 
encouraged the hiring of some groups of marginal workers, particularly the many older workers 
in the country. Efforts were also made to improve the conditions of other marginal labor groups, 
such as migrant farm workers, by programs like the Mexican Farm Labor Program. 
 
The decade of the 1950s was a time of labor disputes and disclosures of union corruption. 
Secretary Mitchell did not believe labor strikes were “inevitable,” but when they did occur his 
reputation among union leaders as being “very able and fair” and a “shrewd bargainer” made 
him an important mediator. In 1953 he helped to settle the Louisville and Nashville Railroad 
strike, and during the 1956 steel strike he was able to get agreement to a three-year contract, the 
longest in steel industry history. When that steel contract expired and a nationwide strike ensued, 
Mitchell teamed up with Vice President Nixon to affect an end to the 116-day dispute in January 
1960. Mitchell remained in the background during this important settlement, allowing the vice 
president to receive most of the publicity for arranging the end of the strike. It was left to 
Mitchell, however, to defend the settlement terms as noninflationary. 
 
In 1957, as the McClellan Committee began to expose the misdeeds of the union officials and the 
movement for anti-union laws was gaining strength, Mitchell remained impartial. His department 
 
designed a program to prevent abuses in unions without imposing harsh government controls. 
This program was eventually incorporated into the Landrum-Griffin Act (also known as the 
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act) which was passed in September 1959. The 
act called for full disclosure of union operations (direct election of union officials by secret 
ballot, disclosures of welfare funds and union financial affairs) and penalties for violations. The 
Department of Labor was given the power to subpoena and investigate any charges brought to its 
attention, and by May 1960, two-hundred cases of union abuses were being processed per month 
by Mitchell’s staff. 
 
In addition to his Cabinet duties, Secretary Mitchell was also chairman of the Inter-Departmental 
Committee on Migratory Labor and the President’s Distinguished Federal Civilian Service 
Awards Board, and served as vice-chairman of the President’s Committee on Government 
Contracts. He was also a member of the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic 
Growth and the President’s Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped, and sat 
on the board of directors of the American Red Cross. 
 
As the Eisenhower years came to an end, Mitchell was considered as a possible Vice Presidential 
running-mate for Richard Nixon in 1960. However, Henry Cabot Lodge finally became the 
Republican’s choice. Mitchell’s only political effort after leaving the Department of Labor was 
an unsuccessful campaign for the New Jersey governorship in 1961. Following that defeat, he 
returned to private business. 
 
When Secretary Mitchell left Washington, he was believed by some to have been “the best 
Cabinet Officer Dwight David Eisenhower has been lucky enough to get and keep.” (Willard 
Shelton, The Washington Guild, June 14, 1957.) James Mitchell himself believed that his major 
accomplishment had been to give “a new face to the Republican Party” in the eyes of American 
labor. Of the success and opportunities created for the party by his own personal rapport with 
labor he said, “Well, there is a foundation now to build on in the future.” 
 
The Papers of James P. Mitchell were received in two separate accessions, one in 1964 and the 
other in 1970. The two were originally processed as separate collections; however, they have 
now been integrated to form one single collection of 283 boxes. 
 
The papers have been arranged into nine series: Secretary of Labor; Administrative; Labor 
Affairs; Committees, Councils and Boards; White House; Congressional; Political; Reading File; 
and Invitations. With the exception of the Labor Affairs series, these series titles are the same as 
those used by members of Secretary Mitchell’s staff in organizing his files during the 
Administration. The Labor Affairs series was created by an Eisenhower Library staff archivist to 
incorporate all those materials which did not obviously belong to any of the other eight series. A 
large percentage of the documents or cases of documents in Mitchell’s papers were marked by 
his staff in red pencil at the top with a heading (Administrative, Political, White House, etc.) to 
designate where that document was to be filed. In the first years of the Administration these 
headings were written out, but from 1959 through 1961 a combined letter-number abbreviation 
was used (such as ES - 1 which represents a document to be filed in the Bureau of Employment 
Security - Summary Plans and Reports folders). The documents which were never marked by 
Mitchell’s staff have been arranged by an Eisenhower Library staff archivist either in 
 
combination with similar materials or in separate folders after the appropriate series for the 
material was determined. 
 
Within each series, the documents are arranged by topic (also marked by Mitchell’s staff) and 
then by chronology. In many cases, the red-pencilled topics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
President’s Committee on Government Contracts, etc.) were used in the present arrangement of 
the collection for folder titles. In addition to the indication on the document of where it was to be 
filed, Mitchell’s staff also noted (at the bottom) in which of Mitchell’s files a copy of the 
document or a cross reference to it was to be placed. Yellow cross reference sheets were filed 
throughout the collection. However, it is not always possible to locate a document from a cross 
reference, which perhaps indicates that either some documents were not retained in the files or 
the collection received by the Eisenhower Library is incomplete. 
 
The Mitchell Papers are most complete and detailed for the years 1955 and 1960, though the 
reason for this is not clear. Topics documented in the collection include Department of Labor 
administration, Republican party affairs, civil defense, labor disputes, migrant labor, civil rights 
in labor, minimum wage, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, amendments to the Taft-
Hartley Act, unemployment insurance and other employee benefits, the federal budget, 
international labor affairs, the Landrum-Griffin Act, labor unions and union officials, economic 
affairs, federal-state relations in labor, departmental legislative programs and congressional 
relations, defense mobilization, labor-management relations, employment and manpower, labor 
standards, importation of foreign labor, public opinion on labor affairs, departmental agencies 
and bureaus, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Secretary’s Policy Committee, Presidential and 
various advisory committees, and Administration labor policies. Major correspondents include 
various labor leaders, members of unions and the working class in general, congressmen and 
senators, White House staff members, Department of Labor staff members, and other Cabinet 
officers. 
 
A small portion of the 1953 materials in this collection are documents from the period in which 
Martin Durkin, Mitchell’s predecessor, served as Secretary of Labor. Those few items in the 
collection dating from 1961 to 1964 consist of correspondence relating to Mitchell’s business 
affairs with the Fund for International Social and Economic Education, the Committee for 
Improvement of Management in Government, the Committee for Economic Development, the 
National Civil Service League, and Crown Zellerbach Corporation. A number of books, 
photographs, records, films, and tapes were removed from the Mitchell Papers and turned over to 
the audio-visual and book collections of the Eisenhower Library.
