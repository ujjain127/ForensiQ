Abstract.
The importance of visual silhouettes for host ﬁnding by the southern pine
beetle (SPB), Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), and the potential for dis-
ruption of this process using visual deterrents were evaluated with multiple-funnel traps,
painted white or black, and with clear, white, or black Plexiglas sticky panels. All traps
and panels were baited with the SPB attractant frontalure. The effect of combined semi-
ochemical and visual disruption was evaluated in funnel traps by including the antiaggre-
gation pheromone verbenone, or the repellent/inhibitory host compound 4-allylanisole, in
addition to the attractant. Visual treatments had a highly signiﬁcant effect on catch of SPB
and the predatory clerid beetle Thanasimus dubius. In attractant-baited traps, white paint
alone reduced the average number of SPB caught by 72% in Florida and 68% in Louisiana.
The repellent 4-allylanisole reduced catch of SPB by 56% in Florida and 45% in Louisiana.
Verbenone was eluted at 25% of the targeted rate and did not affect total catch in either
place. White panels trapped 79% fewer SPB than black, and 55% fewer than clear, with
both differences signiﬁcant. Clear panels also caught signiﬁcantly fewer (254%) SPB than
black panels. Capture of T. dubius was reduced signiﬁcantly by clear (261%) or white
(256%) panels compared to black but did not differ signiﬁcantly between clear and white
panels. The percentage of female SPB captured was not signiﬁcantly changed by visual
treatments but was, as expected, reduced by verbenone. Neither visual nor semiochemical
treatments inﬂuenced the sex ratio of T. dubius. The potential for using visual disruptants
for protection of trees was assessed in front of a single SPB infestation by painting trees
either white or black to 4.5 m. White trees showed fewer landings by SPB and a reduced
density of successful and total SPB attacks within, but not above, the painted area. These
results show that both SPB and T. dubius can be signiﬁcantly affected by altering visual
silhouettes, and that visual and semiochemical treatments, especially used in combination,
may increase effectiveness of bark beetle disruption strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Host selection by insects consists of a series of ﬁve
steps: host-habitat ﬁnding, host ﬁnding, host recogni-
tion, host acceptance, and host suitability (Kogan
1994). These steps lead to acceptance or rejection of
a resource (Kennedy 1965, Miller and Strickler 1984).
Under appropriate conditions, individuals progressive-
ly narrow their search, responding to environmental
stimuli with programmed behaviors, until they locate
a suitable host. If conditions are not appropriate the
process is disrupted, thus ‘‘stranding’’ the insect at a
previous step (Kogan 1994). Because insects sense en-
vironmental variables through multiple sensory mo-
dalities, each potentially linked to behavioral events
associated with host selection, there are multiple op-
portunities to disrupt insect host selection by targeting
a variety of sensory cues. Interplay between or among

modalities during host selection is common, thereby
increasing behavioral plasticity (Harris and Miller
1982, Prokopy and Owens 1983, Miller and Strickler
1984), further suggesting that disruption may be en-
hanced by targeting more than one sensory cue.
The southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis
Zimmermann, is an aggressive, tree-killing bark beetle
that primarily attacks standing trees (Gara et al. 1965;
see Moser et al. 1987 for exceptions). Its host range
includes pine species common to the southern United
States, with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and shortleaf
pine (Pinus echinata L.) the most frequently infested
(Price et al. 1992). Host selection by this beetle in-
volves a variety of sensory cues, likely including ol-
faction, vision, mechanoreception, and gustation (Gara
et al. 1965, Kinzer et al. 1969, Elkinton and Wood
1980, White 1981, Raffa and Berryman 1982, Payne
1986). Successful reproduction of SPB depends upon
mass attack of conspeciﬁcs overwhelming host de-
fenses and causing tree death (Raffa and Berryman
1987). This is accomplished through pheromonally me-

VISUAL DISRUPTION OF HOST FINDING
diated aggregation and necessarily leads to multiple
models for host selection, i.e., the majority of beetles
ﬁnd hosts by secondary (pheromonal) signals, while
ﬁrst-attacking, pioneer beetles (Borden 1974) use other
means that are not fully understood at present.
Olfactory cues are considered to be the most im-
portant stimuli for attracting and inhibiting bark beetles
(Wood 1982). This belief, combined with the need to
understand and modify bark beetle behavior and de-
velop efﬁcient trapping methods, has concentrated be-
havioral research of scolytids on semiochemicals
(Wood 1982, Payne and Billings 1989, Salom et al.
1992, Hayes et al. 1994). Semiochemicals have im-
portant effects on behavior, have been widely used to
monitor populations, and have been effectively used at
times to control bark beetle infestations (Borden 1993,
1997). Because of variability of responses to semi-
ochemicals among individual beetles (Berisford et al.
1990), management tactics based on semiochemicals
can vary in effectiveness (Rudinsky et al. 1974, Borden
et al. 1986, Borden 1993, 1997, Shea 1994). In addi-
tion, attempts to improve effectiveness of inhibitory
semiochemicals against SPB through increasing elution
rates or applying multiple elutants have not signiﬁ-
cantly changed results (Hayes et al. 1994). This sug-
gests that a better understanding of the bark beetle host
selection process could be used to improve the effec-
tiveness of management tactics that include behavioral
deterrents.
Visual orientation of bark beetles to hosts has long
been considered an important component of their host
selection process (Gara et al. 1965, Shepherd 1966,
Lanier 1983, Payne and Coulson 1985, Borden et al.
1986, Payne 1986, Turchin and Odendaal 1996). Many
species of scolytids, including SPB, land on dark, ver-
tical objects, and this feature often is incorporated into
traps to increase their effectiveness (Lindgren 1983).
Management of the SPB routinely includes cutting trees
in front of infestations, in part to remove nearby ver-
tical silhouettes. Gara et al. (1965) proposed three mod-
els of SPB host selection, one of which suggests that
when an area has aggregation pheromone present (i.e.,
in an actively expanding infestation) vision is the most
important orientation behavior.
Vision has been largely ignored in studies of host
orientation and in the development of new management
tactics, which are usually semiochemically based. Our
objectives were to determine whether the orientation
of SPB to simulated hosts (i.e., traps) can be disrupted
by altering the appearance of visual silhouettes, and,
if so, to determine its importance relative to, and in
conjunction with, semiochemical deterrents for tree
protection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Semiochemical effects of paint
According to the manufacturer, the only difference
between the two spray paints that we used is pigmen-
tation (S. DiSalzatore, Krylon Division of the Sherwin-
Williams Company, 30 January 1996, personal com-
munication), not volatile solvents or carriers. Labora-
tory bioassays were used to examine potential repellent
effects of each paint on walking SPB (Hayes et al.
1994). Sticky panels made from Plexiglas that was clear
or colored (without paint) were used to compare total
catch when visual silhouettes were altered without
paint. Potential alteration of elution rates (i.e., the rate
of evaporation of the semiochemical from the lure),
due to different temperatures of white- and black-paint-
ed traps, was assessed by placing two traps, one white
and one black, in two light environments: full sun and
full shade. Light levels were measured using a cepto-
meter (Decagon, Pullman, Washington) read in four
cardinal directions at two times (0930, 4 September
1996; 1230, 6 September 1996). Elution rates of fron-
talure were measured gravimetrically on 26 August and
17 September 1996. Six elution devices (Table 1) were
placed on each trap.
Funnel trap studies
To determine the disruptive potential of visual treat-
ments alone and in combination with semiochemicals,
six treatments were tested simultaneously (Table 1) us-
ing 16-unit multiple funnel traps (Phero Tech, Incor-
porated, Delta, British Columbia, Canada). Traps were
painted either white or black (three traps of each) with
glossy spray paint (Krylon Division, Sherwin-Williams
Company, Solon, Ohio). Black paint (applied over the
black plastic) was used to control for potential semi-
ochemical effects of the paint, as well as any potential
differences in escape rates due to any physical alter-
ations of the trapping surface. Each of the six traps
contained the SPB attractant frontalure (Table 1). Ad-
ditionally, to test the effectiveness of visual treatments
combined with semiochemicals, one trap of each color
also contained the antiaggregation pheromone verben-
one or the host-produced repellent compound 4-allyl-
anisole.
Treated traps were randomly placed along the most
active front of SPB infestations, at least 10 m apart and
from unattacked trees. Traps were collected daily for
six consecutive days and systematically rotated after
each collection so that each treatment appeared in each
location once (Hayes et al. 1994). Total catches of SPB
and a major predator, Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Cole-
optera: Cleridae), were counted from daily collections.
Each 6-d set of collections was considered one repli-
cate. In Florida, ﬁve sites were used to produce six
replicates in June 1995. In July 1995, two sites in Lou-
isiana were used for four additional replicates.
Sticky panel studies
To eliminate any possibility of paint volatiles af-
fecting SPB behavior, and to include a ‘‘no silhouette’’
treatment (i.e., clear to the human eye), an experiment
was conducted using sticky panels (61 3 41 3 0.32

cm thick) constructed from clear, black, or white Plexi-
glas (Table 1), covered with clear polyethylene ﬁlm
(0.1016 mm thick) and coated with Stikem Special
(Michel and Pelton Company, Emeryville, California).
A single pipette of frontalure (Table 1) was attached
to each panel. Panels were placed in a six-position
array, as described above, with each treatment being
represented two times. After each collection period,
traps were rotated sequentially until each trap had ap-
peared in each location twice (12 collection periods;
12 replications).
Effect of tree painting on landing and colonization
The effect of painting potential host trees on infes-
tation by SPB and Ips spp. was evaluated in a 14-yr-
old loblolly pine plantation located at Idlewild Re-
search Station, Clinton, Louisiana. In front of an active
SPB infestation, 15 trees were selected and randomly
assigned three visual treatments (unpainted, black, or
white), giving ﬁve replications of each treatment. Trees
were painted to ;4.5 m using latex house paint (Wal-
Mart, Incorporated, Bentonville, Arkansas) in July
1995. Sticky traps (9 3 30 3 1.25 cm thick) were
attached to each painted tree at 2.5 m on 11 July 1995.
They consisted of wood, painted black or white to
match each tree, covered with 0.1016 mm thick ‘‘vis-
queen’’ (Poly America, Grand Prairie, Texas) that was
coated with Stickem Special and misted lightly with
permethrin (2% concentration in water). Sticky traps
were collected approximately every other day until
trees were felled.
When the active front of the SPB infestation had
moved past the group of treated trees, trees were eval-
uated and, if mass attacked, felled and sampled for
attacks at roughly 2-m intervals. Attacks were identi-
ﬁed as SPB (successful or unsuccessful) or nuptial
chambers of Ips spp. Three species of Ips were present
(I. avulsus, I. calligraphus, I. grandicollis), but no ef-
fort was made to attribute damage to individual species.
Reﬂectance spectra
Reﬂectance spectra of visual treatments were gen-
erated by comparison to a white standard using a Lab-
sphere RSA-HP-84 integrating sphere (Labsphere,
North Sutton, New Hampshire) attached to a Hewlett-
Packard HP 8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer.
Statistical analyses
The numbers of SPB or T. dubius caught during each
collection period were transformed by (log10[Y 1 1])
to normalize data and reduce heteroscedasticity of var-
iances. Funnel trap experiments were analyzed by
mixed-model ANOVA using a randomized block ex-
perimental design with a 2 3 3 factorial treatment
structure and site as the (random effect) blocking factor
(PROC GLM; SAS Institute 1994). Data from Florida
and Louisiana were analyzed separately. For sticky
panel experiments, data were analyzed using a two-
way mixed-model ANOVA with date of collection rep-
resenting replicates and including the effects of visual
treatment, as well as appropriate interaction terms, in
the model (PROC GLM; SAS Institute 1994). Collec-
tion date and its interaction terms were considered ran-
dom variables. Means were compared using the Least

Signiﬁcant Difference procedure (LSD; SAS Institute
1994) only if the overall model and the individual main
effect were signiﬁcant. Where interaction terms were
not signiﬁcant (P . 0.10) across analyses, they were
removed from ANOVA models. The effect of treat-
ments on the percentage of females captured in funnel
traps was determined with the SAS system for cate-
gorical data analysis (PROC CATMOD; SAS Institute
1994). Individual contrasts were used to compare
means where appropriate.
To determine the effect of trap color and environ-
mental light on elution rates, mean elution rates of
frontalure on black and white traps were compared us-
ing t tests for each date in each light environment.
The average sum of SPB and clerids captured on
sticky traps placed on painted trees were analyzed by
t test. Sums were used for analysis because the total
number of captures is the most relevant due to the
strong temporal component of mass attacks among
trees in the study. The mean number of SPB attacks,
total and successful, was analyzed by one-way ANO-
VA. Attack data from each tree were pooled to produce
two means: one from below 4.5 m (4.5 m was the top
of the painted area on painted trees) and one from above
4.5 m, with separate analyses conducted for each of
the two locations. The mean number of Ips nuptial
chambers below 4.5 m was not subjected to statistical
analysis because of the frequency of zeros in the data
set. One white tree was not attacked by either SPB or
Ips, and was excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS
Semiochemical effects of paint
Neither paint had any repellent effect on walking
SPB in the laboratory (white: 22 SPB tested, 11 female
and 11 male, 0 repelled; black: 21 SPB tested, 10 fe-
male and 11 male, 0 repelled). Additionally, our results
obtained with Plexiglas panels were similar to those
obtained with painted funnel traps (Figs. 1 and 2), fur-
ther suggesting that semiochemical effects of black and
white paint, if any exist, were similar. Comparison of
frontalure-only treatments shows that white Plexiglas
panels caught 79% fewer SPB than black, while white-
painted funnel traps caught 72% fewer SPB in Florida
and 68% fewer in Louisiana than their black counter-
parts.
There was no signiﬁcant difference observed be-
tween frontalure eluted from black (X¯ 5 46 mg/d, low
light; 58 mg/d, full sun) or white (X¯ 5 48 mg/d, low
light; 56 mg/d, full sun) funnel traps within each light
treatment (t 5 0.6187, df 5 10, P 5 0.5499, low light;
t 5 1.2035, df 5 10, P 5 0.2565, full sun).
Funnel trap studies
SPB.—In Florida, white multiple funnel traps caught
72% fewer SPB’s than black traps when both traps were
baited with attractant alone (Fig. 1A). Semiochemical
treatment also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced trap catch of
SPB (Table 2). The repellent 4-allylanisole reduced
catch of SPB by 56 and 97% when placed on black
and white traps, respectively, when compared to the
black treatment with attractant only (Fig. 1A). Due to
such factors as infestation size and pine basal area, site
was a signiﬁcant explanatory variable (Table 2). The
interaction terms visual 3 semiochemical treatments
and site 3 visual 3 semiochemical treatments were not
statistically signiﬁcant for the Florida data.
In Louisiana, catches of SPB averaged less than half
those in Florida (Fig. 1B), with site again being sig-
niﬁcant and visual treatment being the most signiﬁcant
factor. White traps with attractant only caught 68%
fewer SPB than the semiochemically equivalent black
treatment. The repellent 4-allylanisole reduced trap
catch by 45% alone and by 83% in combination with
white paint. There was no signiﬁcant interaction be-
tween semiochemical and visual treatments in either
Florida or Louisiana.
Semiochemical treatment signiﬁcantly affected sex
ratio in both Florida (
5 308.05, P 5 0.0000) and
2
x2
Louisiana (
5 100.61, P 5 0.0000), while visual

x2
treatment did not (
5 0.06, P 5 0.8117, Florida;
2
x1
5 0.15, P 5 0.6970, Louisiana). Verbenone had the
2
x1
greatest effect on capture of females in both places,
catching 65.6% females in Florida (compared with
frontalure alone, 39.3% females,
5 231.53, P 5
2
x1
0.0000; or frontalure with 4-allylanisole, 25.9%, fe-
males,
5 154.99, P 5 0.0000) and 64.5% in Lou-
2

isiana (compared with frontalure alone, 37.2% females,
5 80.52, P 5 0.0000; or frontalure with 4-allylan-
2
x1
isole 33.2% females,
5 65.44, P 5 0.0000). The
2
x1
interaction between semiochemical and visual treat-
ments was not signiﬁcant in Florida (
5 4.36, P 5
2
x2
0.1128) but was signiﬁcant in Louisiana (
5 13.47,
2
x2
P 5 0.0012). This effect was made signiﬁcant by a
higher percentage of females captured in black ver-
benone traps compared to white verbenone traps (67%
female vs. 55% female) and a lower percentage of fe-
males in black 4-allylanisole traps compared to white
(31% female vs. 40% female). Because the magnitude
of this effect was small compared to the main effect
of the semiochemical, comparisons were made between
semiochemical treatments, as previously described.
Thanasimus dubius.—Although more than twice as
many T. dubius were caught in Louisiana than in Flor-
ida (1679 vs. 793), reductions in catches caused by the
white silhouettes were similar, 85% in Florida and 88%
in Louisiana. Site was again a signiﬁcant variable (Ta-
ble 2). In both states, total clerid capture was unaffected
by semiochemical treatment, as was sex ratio (
5
2
x2
2.09, P 5 0.3523). In Florida, the percentage of female
clerids captured varied from a low of 40.9% in white
verbenone traps to a high of 52.5% in white frontalure
traps, while in Louisiana the percentage of females
varied from 45.9% in black traps baited with frontalure
and 4-allylanisole to 59.7% in white traps baited with

clerids (54.9%) than did black traps (47.8%), but white

tured 1455 clerids. The interaction between semi-

(
5 0.59, P 5 0.7428).
2
x2
Sticky panel studies
The effects of Plexiglas sticky traps on SPB (Fig. 2)
were similar to those found with funnel traps baited
with attractant alone (Fig. 1A, B). Date of collection
was signiﬁcant (F11,22 5 34.0714, P , 0.0001, MSE 5
0.1343); this is not surprising since the dynamics of
SPB infestations vary dramatically over short periods
of time. The effect of visual treatment was highly sig-
niﬁcant (F2,22 5 59.4348, P , 0.0001), with white pan-
els (X¯ 6 1 SE 5 68 6 13.7 SPB) catching 79% fewer
than black (320 6 60.5 SPB; P , 0.0001) and 55%
fewer than clear (149 6 37.5 SPB; P , 0.0014). Clear
panels caught signiﬁcantly (254%) fewer SPB than
black panels (P , 0.0001). The interaction between
date and visual treatment was not signiﬁcant (F22,36 5
1.5105, P 5 0.1328).
T. dubius also were signiﬁcantly affected by panel
color (F2,11 5 19.7158, P , 0.0001, MSE 5 0.2175).
Catch on clear and white panels did not differ (P 5
0.3364). Both clear and white caught fewer T. dubius
than black (P , 0.0001); clear reduced catch by 61%
and white by 56%. The catch of clear panels did not
differ signiﬁcantly from that of white, suggesting that
clerids respond differently than SPB in this regard.
Date (F11,22 5 4.7643, P , 0.0009) had a signiﬁcant
effect on total catch, and the interaction between date
and visual treatment also had a small, but signiﬁcant,
effect on the total number of T. dubius caught (F22,36
5 2.3734, P , 0.0103).

Notes: T. dubius is Thanasimus dubius LeConte, a clerid
predator of the southern pine beetle. The interaction term
visual treatment 3 semiochemical treatment was not signif-
icant (P . 0.10) in each case and was deleted from the AN-
OVA model.
† The 3-way interaction term (site 3 visual 3 semiochem-
ical treatment) was used as the denominator for F tests on
main effects.
Effect of tree painting on landing and colonization
All of the unpainted and black-painted trees were
attacked by SPB. Four of ﬁve white trees were attacked
by SPB; however, the pattern of colonization differed
from the other two treatments (Fig. 3). Sticky traps
showed that more SPB landed on black trees (74.4 6
17.6 SPB) than white (16.4 6 2.9 SPB; t 5 3.25, P 5
0.0117, df 5 8). Although very few clerids were cap-
tured, they followed the same pattern with total land-
ings on black trees (3.8 6 0.02 clerids) being greater
than white (0.8 6 0.37 clerids; t 5 3.20, P 5 0.0127,
df 5 8).
Below 4.5 m, paint had a signiﬁcant effect on the
density of SPB attacks (F2,11 5 28.76, P , 0.0001, MSE
5 8.37). Attack density was highest on unpainted trees
(16.9 6 2.05 attacks/500 cm2), followed by black (10.2
6 0.32 attacks/500 cm2) and white (2.2 6 0.72 attacks/
500 cm2). For SPB, all three treatment means were
signiﬁcantly different (unpainted vs. black, P ,
0.0036; vs. white, P , 0.0001; black vs. white, P ,
0.0017; least signiﬁcant difference test, SAS Institute
1994). The density of Ips nuptial chambers below 4.5
m was not subjected to statistical analysis due to the
prevalence of zeros; however, the pattern of attack by
Ips in white vs. unpainted or black trees appears to
differ (Fig. 3B). Below 4.5 m the density of Ips attacks
is higher in white trees, suggesting that an interaction
between visual treatment and resource utilization by
SPB and Ips is possible.
Reﬂectance spectra
Reﬂectance spectra of visual treatments are pre-
sented in Fig. 4. With the exception of noise in the
300-350 nm ultraviolet range, reﬂectance of the three
white surfaces employed is, as expected, markedly
higher than the three black surfaces. Clear and black
Plexiglas reﬂect to a similar degree, yet catch of SPB
and T. dubius differed between them, suggesting that
reﬂectance is only one of several visual properties uti-
lized by these species for host ﬁnding. We have in-
cluded an average reﬂectance spectrum from loblolly
pine bark for comparison (Fig. 4), although we did not
measure landing rates on unpainted trees.
DISCUSSION
The results demonstrate that host selection by the
southern pine beetle can be disrupted by both visual
and semiochemical deterrents, and when combined
their action shows promise for reducing attacks to lev-
els that may effectively protect trees. The total number

Attack density (number/500 cm2) of

replicate trees taken from a single SPB infes-
tation, Louisiana 1995. Note that there are no
data for unpainted trees at 3 m or 4 m.
of beetles necessary for host tree mortality is unknown,
but it is clear that high densities of beetles must attack
rapidly for healthy trees to be killed. For example,
Raffa and Berryman (1983) determined that 40 suc-
cessful attacks per square meter are necessary for
lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, to succumb to attack
by Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. With SPB,
Hodges et al. (1979) suggest that 100 attacks/m2 were
necessary to overcome the defenses of an ‘‘average’’
loblolly or shortleaf pine. Neither of these studies gives
data on the minimum area over which these densities
must occur for tree death. In trying to determine the
total number of SPB needed for mortality, Cook and
Hain (1987) observed that ;2000 SPB caged onto a
tree bole were insufﬁcient to overcome the defenses of
most loblolly and shortleaf pines in their study. Al-
though tree death depends on rate of beetle recruitment,
tree size, and defensive capabilities, it is not necessary
for protective treatments to eliminate landings, because
host defenses can thwart a signiﬁcant number of at-
tacking individuals (Thatcher et al. 1980, Cook and
Hain 1987). The ;90% reduction that we observed
when visual and semiochemical deterrents were com-
bined may be enough for tree protection, but studies
speciﬁcally addressing this potential application need
to be carried out. In addition, as our tree attack data
show (Fig. 3A, B), the effects on nontarget species must
be evaluated as well (Hayes and Strom 1994).
Published experiments investigating scolytid re-
sponses to visual cues have reported mixed results;
however, most studies were designed speciﬁcally to
improve trapping efﬁciency and have limited their in-
terpretations to effects on attraction (Lindgren et al.
1983, Dubbel et al. 1985, Fatzinger 1985). Trypoden-
dron lineatum (Olivier) responding to attractants were
unaffected by clear traps or those of a different hue
(i.e., dominant wavelength) (Lindgren et al. 1983, Dub-
bel et al. 1985), but white traps, where included, caught
the fewest individuals (Dubbel et al. 1985). Catch of
Ips typographus L. depended upon trap location and
spacing, with interactions between sensory modalities
(olfaction and vision) and environments (wooded and
open) being observed (Niemeyer 1985). Ips montanus
(Eichhoff) and Dendroctonus ponderosae preferred
dark colors over light ones, and fewer D. terebrans
(Olivier) were caught in traps painted glossy white than
ﬂat black (Fatzinger 1985). Although the appearance
of clear traps is based on human perception, and may
therefore be misleading (see Fig. 4), the lack of a no-
silhouette treatment from these previously cited ex-
periments makes it difﬁcult to determine whether dif-
ferences were due to attraction or repellency of the
different treatments.
The relationship between scolytid responses to col-
ors and their visual physiology is unclear, and, to our
knowledge, it is unknown whether true color vision
(i.e., the ability to distinguish colors according to their
wavelength composition at any intensity [Browne and
August 1999

Bennett 1981]) exists in this family. In the laboratory,
Groberman and Borden (1981, 1982) found good cor-
relation between electroretinogram (ERG) responses
and walking behavior for Ips paraconfusus Lanier,
Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, and T. lineatum.
They found two sensitivity maxima in the visual range
(400–700 nm), one at ;450 nm (blue) and one at ;520
nm (green) for both I. paraconfusus and D. pseudo-
tsugae (Groberman and Borden 1982). In walking as-
says, T. lineatum and D. pseudotsugae were similarly
attracted to these wavelengths (Groberman and Borden
1981); however, their studies excluded ultraviolet light
(300–400 nm), a range in which there is often another
peak of response. Clearly more research is necessary
before the relationship between light environments and
ﬁeld behavior of bark beetles is understood and treat-
ments can be successfully applied.
Loblolly pine bark (Fig. 4) may produce a highly
visible signal under a forest canopy. Although it varies
considerably to the human eye, Hailman (1979) reports
loblolly pine bark to be dark orange (see Fig. 4), a hue
which produces a highly visible signal in the yellow–
green light of woodland shade (Endler 1993). The vis-
ibility of these relatively long wavelengths for bark
beetles is undetermined; however, hues reﬂecting long
wavelengths often effectively capture forest-dwelling
insects such as Aedes mosquitoes (Browne and Bennett
1981, Muir et al. 1992) and various scolytids (Schon-
herr 1977, Moser and Browne 1978, Lindgren et al.
1983). Whether this is because these hues are more or
less visible is unknown. Data from our study indicate
that white traps are apparent to SPB, but avoided, while
black traps are attractive. The latter appears also to be
true for T. dubius, as suggested by Wyatt et al. (1993).
Although attack density was intermediate on black-
painted trees, we did not attempt to evaluate the relative
difference in attraction between black and unpainted
trees. Clearly an increased understanding of the eco-
logical mechanisms of visual attraction and repellency
are important for the use of visual disruption in man-
agement.
Kogan (1994) proposes that olfaction and vision are
likely the most important senses for host ﬁnding, an
idea supported by our data with SPB. Bark beetles, like
SPB, that rely on aggregation to kill trees for successful
reproduction, necessarily have more than one method
of host selection. Pioneering individuals (Borden 1974)
attack ﬁrst, without beneﬁt of aggregation pheromone,
while all others have the opportunity to respond to
pheromones. Gara et al. (1965) proposed that both ol-
faction and vision are important for host-ﬁnding by
SPB, with their relative importance depending upon
local conditions. For example, they suggest that vision
is the most important sensory modality when an area
has aggregation pheromone present; beetles land on
vertical silhouettes without regard to whether or not
they are hosts. Although not explicitly tested by Gara
et al. (1965) or others for SPB, available data suggest
1036

that host recognition by bark beetles is gustatory, not
taking place until the adult bores through the outer bark
to the phloem (Elkinton and Wood 1980, Raffa and
Berryman 1982).
Life history characteristics may relate visual and ol-
factory cues to host-ﬁnding strategies of bark beetles
(Raffa et al. 1993). Prokopy and Owens (1978) hy-
pothesize that generalist vs. specialist insects, cate-
gories usually applied in the context of chemical ecol-
ogy, might also be useful for describing visual behav-
ior. They suggest that visual orientation is dependent
upon the formation of search images based on plant
morphological characters that afford visual distinction
of hosts. The result that SPB were greatly affected by
our visual treatments (both white and clear) and that
this species is, at most, oligophagous, suggests that
SPB may be considered a visual specialist (sensu Pro-
kopy and Owens 1978). However, we propose that this
designation depends on host form (vertical vs. hori-
zontal silhouettes) rather than species. In the presence
of attractants, SPB lands readily upon any dark, vertical
silhouette, including nonhosts (Gara et al. 1965). Den-
droctonus ponderosae, also considered an aggressive
species (Raffa et al. 1993), lands randomly on vertical
objects (Hynum and Berryman 1980) and does not dis-
tinguish between susceptible and resistant hosts until
gustation (Raffa and Berryman 1982). Closely related,
less aggressive species (e.g., Ips pini (Say) and Ips
perroti Swaine) that readily attack nonvertical host ma-
terial, but have similarly limited host species ranges,
do not seem to be as affected by our visual treatments
(B. D. Ayres, unpublished data). Byers (1993) used
baited ‘‘puddle’’ traps, apparently without any silhou-
ette, to effectively capture I. typographus, suggesting
that this species is not affected by visual silhouettes
when aggregation pheromone is present. Whether these
patterns of attack and trap results are related to these
Ips spp. being visual generalists, due to their propensity
to attack multiple host forms, or alternatively, that Ips
species simply use vision less than Dendroctonus spe-
cies, remains to be seen but needs testing. Lindgren et
al. (1983) report that the ambrosia beetles T. lineatum
and Gnathotrichus sulcatus (LeConte) also considered
unaggressive scolytids, are similarly unaffected by trap
color, although materials used were relatively nonre-
ﬂective, and white was not included in the treatments.
We hypothesize that the importance of visual sil-
houettes for scolytid host ﬁnding is related to their level
of aggression and host utilization patterns. Less ag-
gressive species often are able to use olfaction to locate
hosts, i.e., have demonstrated primary attraction (Raffa
et al. 1993), and may infest branches or horizontal
hosts, sometimes preferring these over vertical forms
(Gara et al. 1965). These species may be considered
visual generalists, leading them to be less affected by
visual treatments (Prokopy and Owens 1978). Aggres-
sive species, on the other hand, do not tend to orient
by way of primary attractants (Moeck et al. 1981, Raffa
et al. 1993), and land predominantly on vertical objects,
suggesting that they are visual specialists. In tying to-
gether visual ecology and insect management, Prokopy
and Owens (1978) suggest that visual specialists, the
aggressive bark beetles in our hypothesis, can be more
easily manipulated using visual deterrents.
White color (paint) signiﬁcantly reduced landings
and attacks of SPB on trees in our study, suggesting
that the use of a nonattractive colored surface (e.g.,
white) has potential for tree protection. SPB attacks
were concentrated on the stem area primarily above the
white paint (Fig. 3), leading us to believe that painting
higher (perhaps up to and into the live crown) or using
a semiochemical deterrent in addition to the paint, as
was effective with funnel traps, would increase the ef-
fectiveness of this treatment for protection of individ-
ual trees. Black paint appeared to have an intermediate
effect on attack density (Fig. 3); however, we cannot
separate these effects between pre- and post-landing.
Visual treatments may increase management alter-
natives for control of SPB infestations. Buffer areas of
uninfested trees are routinely felled at the advancing
edge of SPB infestations to enhance the effectiveness
of cut-and-remove or cut-and-leave control strategies
(Thatcher et al. 1980). Cutting a buffer eliminates ver-
tical silhouettes in close proximity to aggregation pher-
omone and provides distance between potential hosts
and emerging beetles; however, it also necessitates that
the number of uninfested trees that are cut is greatly
increased. Vertical silhouette modiﬁcation could be
substituted for felling in areas with high-value trees,
while still providing protection from lethal attacks.
Our data for the southern pine beetle demonstrate
that multiple deterrents (e.g., semiochemical and vi-
sual) can increase the effectiveness of management tac-
tics based on behavioral manipulation of this bark
beetle, and perhaps others. For visual silhouette mod-
iﬁcation to be operationally feasible, methods other
than paint will probably have to be developed. In ad-
dition, semiochemicals currently used for SPB man-
agement are eluted at very high rates compared to other
species, perhaps suggesting that more effective com-
pounds or mixtures are yet to be identiﬁed. Research
and development of semiochemicals is ongoing, and
more efﬁcacious products, that are easier to apply, may
be available in the future. However, disruption strate-
gies that target multiple behavioral modalities may be
more effective for management of those species that
use vision as an important component in their host
selection process.
