procedure or concept adequately or to trace the history of the procedures and practices used.  Such identification is 
not intended to imply recommendation, endorsement, or implication that the entities, products, materials, or

Disclaimer No. 2 
The policy of NIST is to use the International System of Units (metric units) in all publications.  In this document, 
however, units are presented in metric units or the inch-pound system, whichever is prevalent in the discipline.   
 
Disclaimer No. 3 
Pursuant to section 7 of the National Construction Safety Team Act, the NIST Director has determined that certain 
evidence received by NIST in the course of this Investigation is “voluntarily provided safety-related information” that is 
“not directly related to the building failure being investigated” and that “disclosure of that information would inhibit the 
voluntary provision of that type of information” (15 USC 7306c). 
In addition, a substantial portion of the evidence collected by NIST in the course of the Investigation has been 
provided to NIST under nondisclosure agreements. 
 
Disclaimer No. 4 
NIST takes no position as to whether the design or construction of a WTC building was compliant with any code 
since, due to the destruction of the WTC buildings, NIST could not verify the actual (or as-built) construction, the 
properties and condition of the materials used, or changes to the original construction made over the life of the 
buildings.  In addition, NIST could not verify the interpretations of codes used by applicable authorities in determining 
compliance when implementing building codes.  Where an Investigation report states whether a system was 
designed or installed as required by a code provision, NIST has documentary or anecdotal evidence indicating 
whether the requirement was met, or NIST has independently conducted tests or analyses indicating whether the 
requirement was met. 
 
Use in Legal Proceedings 
No part of any report resulting from a NIST investigation into a structural failure or from an investigation under the 
National Construction Safety Team Act may be used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter 
mentioned in such report (15 USC 281a; as amended by P.L. 107-231).

ABSTRACT 
This report documents the design and installation of the smoke management systems in World Trade 
Center (WTC) 1, 2, and 7 and compares the designs to the requirements contained in applicable codes and 
standards.  The normal operation of the fully functional smoke management systems in WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 on September 11, 2001, is also documented. 
The report provides an overview of smoke management system concepts, discusses the various 
considerations impacting smoke management system design, and provides a history of the development 
of smoke control related requirements within various national codes and standards.  The report also 
summarizes the smoke management systems in WTC 1, 2, and 7, and the applicable Building Code of the 
City of New York (BCNYC) requirements pertaining to smoke management systems for each building.  
The performance of the installed smoke management systems for WTC 1 and WTC 2 as well as other 
candidate smoke management system configurations were evaluated using the CONTAM building 
airflow and contaminant dispersal computer model for specified fire scenarios.  These scenarios included 
the severe aircraft impact related event scenarios that occurred on September 11, 2001, in order to provide 
a context in which to evaluate smoke management system performance in WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
The report concludes that the smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 were not initiated on 
September 11, 2001, and had the designed smoke purge sequence been initiated it is unlikely that the 
system would have functioned as designed, due to loss of electrical power and/or damage to the heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) shafts and other structural elements in the impact zone.  In 
addition, none of the potential smoke management system configurations evaluated in this report would 
have provided sufficient pressure differentials to contain smoke for the postulated aircraft impact damage 
scenarios, even if these systems were capable of operation after the building sustained damage from the 
aircraft impact. The report further concludes that stair pressurization would have been ineffective in 
improving conditions for occupants trying to exit the building. 
Installation of combination fire/smoke dampers in HVAC ductwork, which was not required in WTC 1 or 
WTC 2, would have acted to slow the development of hazardous conditions on the uppermost floors of 
the building, but would likely not have had a significant effect on the ability of occupants to egress the 
building due to the impassibility of the exit stairways.

PREFACE 
Genesis of This Investigation 
Immediately following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Society of Civil Engineers began 
planning a building performance study of the disaster.  The week of October 7, as soon as the rescue and 
search efforts ceased, the Building Performance Study Team went to the site and began their assessment.  
This was to be a brief effort, as the study team consisted of experts who largely volunteered their time 
away from their other professional commitments.  The Building Performance Study Team issued their 
report in May 2002, fulfilling their goal “to determine probable failure mechanisms and to identify areas 
of future investigation that could lead to practical measures for improving the damage resistance of 
buildings against such unforeseen events.” 
On August 21, 2002, with funding from the U.S. Congress through FEMA, the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) announced its building and fire safety investigation of the WTC 
disaster.  On October 1, 2002, the National Construction Safety Team Act (Public Law 107-231), was 
signed into law.  The NIST WTC Investigation was conducted under the authority of the National 
Construction Safety Team Act. 
The goals of the investigation of the WTC disaster were: 
• 
To investigate the building construction, the materials used, and the technical conditions that 
contributed to the outcome of the WTC disaster. 
• 
To serve as the basis for: 
− 
Improvements in the way buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and used; 
− 
Improved tools and guidance for industry and safety officials; 
− 
Recommended revisions to current codes, standards, and practices; and 
− 
Improved public safety. 
The specific objectives were: 
1. Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the 
aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed; 
2. Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, 
including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and 
emergency response;  
3. Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, operation, 
and maintenance of WTC 1, 2, and 7; and 
4. Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and 
practices that warrant revision.

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
NIST is a nonregulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Technology Administration.  The 
purposes of NIST investigations under the National Construction Safety Team Act are to improve the 
safety and structural integrity of buildings in the United States, and the focus is on fact finding.  NIST 
investigative teams are required to assess building performance and emergency response and evacuation 
procedures in the wake of any building failure that has resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed 
significant potential of substantial loss of life.  NIST does not have the statutory authority to make 
findings of fault or negligence by individuals or organizations.  Further, no part of any report resulting 
from a NIST investigation into a building failure or from an investigation under the National Construction 
Safety Team Act may be used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in 
such report (15 USC 281a, as amended by Public Law 107-231). 
Organization of the Investigation 
The National Construction Safety Team for this Investigation, appointed by the NIST Director, was led 
by Dr. S. Shyam Sunder.  Dr. William L. Grosshandler served as Associate Lead Investigator, 
Mr. Stephen A. Cauffman served as Program Manager for Administration, and Mr. Harold E. Nelson 
served on the team as a private sector expert.   The Investigation included eight interdependent projects 
whose leaders comprised the remainder of the team.  A detailed description of each of these eight projects 
is available at http://wtc.nist.gov.  The purpose of each project is summarized in Table P–1, and the key 
interdependencies among the projects are illustrated in Figure P–1.

This National Construction Safety Team Advisory Committee provided technical advice during the 
Investigation and commentary on drafts of the Investigation reports prior to their public release. 
Public Outreach 
During the course of this Investigation, NIST held public briefings and meetings (listed in Table P–2) to 
solicit input from the public, present preliminary findings, and obtain comments on the direction and 
progress of the Investigation from the public and the Advisory Committee. 
NIST maintained a publicly accessible Web site during this Investigation at http://wtc.nist.gov.  The site 
contained extensive information on the background and progress of the Investigation. 
NIST’s WTC Public-Private Response Plan 
The collapse of the WTC buildings has led to broad reexamination of how tall buildings are designed, 
constructed, maintained, and used, especially with regard to major events such as fires, natural disasters, 
and terrorist attacks.  Reflecting the enhanced interest in effecting necessary change, NIST, with support 
from Congress and the Administration, has put in place a program, the goal of which is to develop and 
implement the standards, technology, and practices needed for cost-effective improvements to the safety 
and security of buildings and building occupants, including evacuation, emergency response procedures, 
and threat mitigation. 
The strategy to meet this goal is a three-part NIST-led public-private response program that includes: 
• 
A federal building and fire safety investigation to study the most probable factors that 
contributed to post-aircraft impact collapse of the WTC towers and the 47-story WTC 7 
building, and the associated evacuation and emergency response experience. 
• 
A research and development (R&D) program to (a) facilitate the implementation of 
recommendations resulting from the WTC Investigation, and (b) provide the technical basis 
for cost-effective improvements to national building and fire codes, standards, and practices 
that enhance the safety of buildings, their occupants, and emergency responders.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The information presented in this report describes the design, installation, and performance of the smoke 
management systems installed in World Trade Center (WTC) 1, 2, and 7. The work described in this 
report is in support of the investigation of active fire protection systems. This is part of the federal 
building and fire safety investigation being performed by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST). 
Specific objectives associated with this effort include the following: 
• 
Document the design and installation of the smoke management systems and compare 
designs to applicable code and standard requirements. 
• 
Document the normal operation of the fully functional smoke management systems, and its 
potential effect on smoke conditions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. 
In order to establish a context in which to evaluate the WTC smoke management systems, this report 
provides an overview of smoke management system concepts, discusses the various considerations 
affecting smoke management system design, and provides a history of the development of smoke control 
related requirements within various national codes and standards. 
The report also summarizes the smoke management systems provided in WTC 1, 2, and 7, and the 
Building Code of the City of New York (BCNYC) requirements pertaining to smoke management 
systems for each building.  The performance of the installed smoke management systems for WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 as well as other candidate smoke management system configurations was evaluated using the 
CONTAM building airflow and contaminant dispersal computer model for specified fire scenarios.  These 
scenarios include the severe aircraft impact related events that occurred on September 11, 2001, in order 
to provide a context in which to evaluate smoke management system performance in WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
E.1 
APPLICABLE CODE REQUIREMENTS 
As a compact entity created under a clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port Authority) is not governed by state or local building codes.  Although not 
required to conform to the BCNYC, the Port Authority’s longstanding policy was to assure that its 
facilities in the City of New York met and, where appropriate, exceeded the requirements of the BCNYC. 
In 1993, the Port Authority and the New York City Department of Buildings entered into a memorandum 
of understanding in which the Port Authority’s longstanding policy was restated.  Under this policy, the 
Port Authority required that the construction drawings for WTC 1, 2, and 7 conform to the requirements

The BCNYC differs from other building codes in one major respect. Changes to a building code generally 
affect only new buildings and are applied to an existing building only when a major renovation or change 
in occupancy occurs within the building. Many provisions contained within the local laws amending the 
BCNYC are applied retroactively; thus, these provisions are required to be implemented in existing 
buildings. All of the requirements included in the local laws listed above were in effect at the time of 
construction of WTC 7, since the local laws all predate the design and construction dates of WTC 7. 
However, only some of the provisions were retroactively applied to WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
In accordance with the BCNYC requirements, WTC 1, 2, and 7 were required to be equipped with fire 
dampers at all duct openings into vertical shaft enclosures, and at penetrations of fire resistance rated 
floors or ceilings. Smoke dampers were required in the main supply duct and main return duct for heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems having a capacity of over 15,000 ft3/min and were 
arranged to close automatically by the operation of duct smoke detectors. Smoke detectors were required 
at the return shaft inlet on each floor. Activation of a detector was required to stop air supply to and return 
from the affected floor. In addition, WTC 7 was required to have either a combined fire/smoke damper or 
independent fire and smoke dampers at any penetration of construction required to have a fire resistance 
rating, under the provisions of Local Law No. 16 pertaining to smoke control. 
Local Law No. 5 required that unsprinklered high-rise buildings be subdivided by fire separations into fire 
compartments on each floor of the building. WTC 1 and WTC 2 were originally subdivided into 
quadrants to meet this requirement, but were later provided with full automatic sprinkler protection, 
negating this requirement. WTC 7 was not required to provide compartmentation, as the building was 
fully sprinklered at the time of its construction. 
Local Law No. 5 required existing office buildings to be provided with one or more smoke shafts by 
means of which smoke and heat could be mechanically vented to the outdoors. In lieu of providing smoke 
shafts, all enclosed exit stairs could be provided with stair pressurization. This requirement applied 
retroactively to WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
Local Law No. 16 added requirements for smoke control that included the provision of smoke dampers in 
HVAC ductwork and separation of ventilation systems serving specified areas of buildings. In addition, a

mechanical means to exhaust six air changes per hour, or 1 cfm/ft2 (whichever is greater) from the largest 
floor of a building, operated manually to exhaust one floor at a time, was required. Under the Port 
Authority policy, these provisions of Local Law No. 16 applied to WTC 7. 
Local Law No. 16 required that an emergency power system be provided having the capacity to operate 
life safety related equipment in high-rise buildings, including ventilation systems for smoke venting or 
control and stair pressurization. This provision was not applied retroactively to WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
Local Law No. 86 stated that existing buildings would be exempt from the smoke shaft and optional stair 
pressurization requirements if they were provided with automatic sprinklers throughout. This provision 
applied retroactively to WTC 1 and WTC 2; therefore, negating the stair pressurization requirement of 
Local Law No. 5 as automatic sprinkler systems were installed throughout WTC 1, 2, and 7. 
E.2 
BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 
Building construction details and building systems comprising WTC 1, 2, and 7 were evaluated to 
develop an understanding of building features that may have impacted smoke movement within the 
buildings and the design/function of smoke management systems. Building HVAC systems are described 
in somewhat greater detail below in order to understand the capabilities of the HVAC systems to perform 
smoke management functions. 
E.2.1 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were comprised of 110 stories above grade and seven levels below grade, and each 
had an approximate footprint area of 42,900 ft2. WTC 1 and WTC 2 were similar architecturally, with 
minor differences in layout.  The interiors of each floor differed due to the particular tenant build-out on 
that floor. In addition, the service core for the North Tower (WTC 1) was oriented east/west while the 
service core for the South Tower (WTC 2) was oriented north/south. The service core gradually decreased 
in size on the upper floors of the building as the numbers of elevators contained on the floors decreased. 
The core spaces were separated from the perimeter spaces in the building by a 2 hour fire resistance rated 
barrier extending slab-to-slab. The cores contained the elevators, exit stairs, bathrooms, and 
miscellaneous equipment rooms. The perimeter office spaces were generally open-plan office spaces 
containing office cubicles. Individual office spaces on the perimeter were generally separated by non-
rated partitions extending only to the drop ceiling. The ventilation plenum above the drop ceiling was 
open around the perimeter of the floor. 
Each tower was provided with three emergency exit stairways, enclosed in 2 hour rated gypsum 
wallboard construction.  The plan location of the stairways shifted at some levels, with occupants required 
to move from one stairway segment to another via a horizontal transfer corridor, separated from the stair 
shafts by fire rated doors.  Stairs 1 and 2 had transfers at the 42nd, 48th, 76th, and 82nd levels.  Stair 1 
had an additional transfer on the 26th floor.  Stair 3 had only a single transfer, at the 76th floor.  Stairs 1 
and 2 were located closer to the perimeter of the core, while Stair 3 was located more toward the center of 
the core.

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
Ninety-nine elevator shafts were located in each building. In order to facilitate movement of the 
thousands of office workers who regularly worked in the towers to the upper office floors in the building, 
a system of express and local elevators was installed in the building. High-speed express elevators 
shuttled people from the lobby to sky lobbies on the 44th floor and 78th floor of the building. Escalators 
connected the sky lobbies to the floors immediately above and below. Local elevators provided access 
from the sky lobby floors to the upper floors of the building. Freight elevators 49 and 50 extended to 
different heights in the building, with freight elevator 50 extending the full height of the building. 
Building ventilation (heating and cooling) was provided in WTC 1 and WTC 2 by HVAC systems located 
in four mechanical equipment rooms (MERs) located on the 7th, 41st, 75th, and 108th floors of each 
building. Each MER was approximately two stories tall and had an upper and lower level. With the 
exception of the 108th floor MER, which was located at the top of the building, above the floors that it 
served, the MERs served the floors immediately above and below the floors in which they were located. 
The WTC 1 aircraft impact occurred in the uppermost portion of the building (92nd through 98th floors), 
served by the 108th floor MER.  The WTC 2 aircraft impact occurred slightly lower in the building (77th 
through 84th floors), served by the 75th floor MER. 
HVAC supply fans were located on the lower level of each MER.  Supply air was provided to the 
building via core, interior, and perimeter HVAC units.  There were two core supply ventilation zones 
(north/south in WTC 2 and east/west in WTC 1, due to the orientation of the core), four interior space 
HVAC zones (corresponding to the four quadrants of the building), and four perimeter zones 
(north/south/east/west).  The core and interior units provided low pressure air that was conditioned at each 
unit in the MER.  Perimeter supply air was provided by high pressure fans and was conditioned at 
induction units located around the perimeter of the building on each floor.  The induction units were 
roughly 18 in. high and were located in front of the windows at the perimeter of the office space. 
Exhaust HVAC fans were located on the upper level of each MER. Four sets of return air shafts were 
located along the east and west sides of the core, returning air from the interior HVAC zones at the four 
quadrants of each floor. Whereas supply ventilation was provided by a ducted supply system utilizing 
metal ductwork, the return ventilation was provided by way of gypsum wallboard return shafts. Air was 
drawn through return grilles on each floor into a return plenum above the occupied spaces on each floor. 
Return air was then drawn to the MER exhaust fans via the gypsum wallboard shafts. 
The original air distribution system configuration may have been substantially modified on some floors of 
the buildings, based on the needs of the tenants occupying various floors of the building and the design 
standards being used at the time of individual tenant retrofits. On some floors new ductwork was 
connected to the base building HVAC ductwork at the major supply air shafts and connections remained 
from the return plenum to the return air shafts.  Perimeter heating and cooling was provided on certain 
floors using small fan coil units (FCUs) located around the perimeter of the return air plenum, replacing 
most of the perimeter induction units.  The FCUs were designed to draw air from the plenum, heat or cool 
the air as necessary as it passed through the coil, and then distribute the air via a small number (2–4) of 
supply air diffusers ducted from each FCU. 
The smoke management system (smoke purge) for WTC 1 and WTC 2 utilized only the interior air 
systems and core systems, which were not modified substantially as a result of tenant retrofits. Perimeter 
air was not used for smoke management. Further, the plenum exhaust arrangement and total air quantities 
remained unchanged, despite individual tenant retrofit configurations. While smoke movement may have

been impacted on a given floor due to changes to the ventilation system on individual floors, overall 
pressure differentials would be expected to remain the same. 
E.2.2 
WTC 7 
WTC 7 was completed in 1987 and was located to the north of the WTC complex on the opposite side of 
Vesey Street. The building consisted of 47 stories above-grade and had a footprint area of approximately 
48,000 ft2. WTC 7 was built over an existing Con Ed substation and a shipping ramp that served the entire 
WTC complex. The lower six floors of the building contained the substation, electrical switchgear, 
emergency generators, transformers, and fuel storage tanks. Floors 3 and 4 also contained a conference 
center for Salomon Smith Barney (SSB), the tenant occupying the largest portion of the building. Floors 7 
through 25 housed multiple tenants, with most occupying a single floor. Floors 7 and 8, 11 through 13, 19 
through 21, and 26 through 27 were occupied by multi-floor tenants.  SSB occupied floors 28 through 45. 
The service core for the building was located in the east-west direction, and contained the elevators, exit 
stairs, bathrooms, and mechanical/electrical equipment rooms. The perimeter spaces were generally either 
open-plan office spaces containing cubicles or hard-walled individual office spaces. Individual office 
spaces were generally separated by non-rated partitions extending only to the drop ceiling. The ventilation 
plenum above the drop ceiling was open around the perimeter of the floor. The building was protected 
throughout by automatic sprinklers with the exception of certain equipment rooms on the lower floors of 
the building. 
The building was served by low-rise (floors 7 through 20), mid-rise (floors 21 thruogh 37), and high-rise 
(floors 38 through 45) elevators, as well as service and freight elevators that ran the entire height of the 
building. There were a total of 31 elevators serving the building. Two exit stairs served the building, and 
were referred to as Stair 1 (or Stair A) and Stair 2 (or Stair B). The position of Stair 1 remained constant 
on each floor of the building. The position of Stair 2 shifted at the 23rd floor, due to the location of the 
low-rise elevators serving the lower floors. 
The individual floors of WTC 7 were served by HVAC equipment located in a fan room on each floor. 
This is in contrast to WTC 1 and WTC 2, which had dedicated MER floors that served multiple floors of 
the buildings. 
During the early 1990s, SSB performed a major tenant retrofit to floors 28 through 45.  The retrofit 
included combining adjacent floors into single floors, relocation of HVAC shafts, and installation of new 
HVAC equipment to supplement base building equipment. Two two-story trading floors were created by 
combining the 40th/41st and 42nd/43rd floors.  The trading floors each had a raised floor that served as a 
return plenum.  HVAC fans and electrical/data services were located beneath the raised floors. 
In addition to the trading floors, various SSB floors were retrofit with technology spaces housing 
computer equipment.  Individual HVAC units were provided to recirculate air within these spaces. A 
large auditorium was included in the northwest corner of the building, spanning the 38th/39th floors. 
Cafeteria spaces with kitchens were also located on the 34th and 41st floors. 
Building ventilation (heating and cooling) was provided on the tenant floors (floors 7 through 47) for the 
base building configuration in WTC 7 by variable air volume (VAV) air handling units (AHUs) located 
on each floor. Each floor in WTC 7 was served by an AHU located in the fan room on that floor that

consisted of two fans feeding into a common plenum. Conditioned air was then distributed to the floor in 
two zones, corresponding to the north/east and south/west portions of the building. The fan room served 
as a return plenum. Return air was drawn into the fan room via three branch ducts leading from the fan 
room. Make-up air was drawn into the fan room via make-up air shafts that connected to the exterior of 
the building via louvers either at the roof or at the 6th floor. 
In accordance with the BCNYC, the WTC 7 HVAC systems were designed to incorporate a smoke purge 
mode, by which each floor of the building could be exhausted/purged of smoke manually on a 
floor-by-floor basis from the fire command center, which was located on the 3rd floor of the building at 
the main lobby security desk. Two smoke exhaust fans were originally located within the building on the 
6th floor and 47th floor. The return air ductwork was connected to the exhaust duct. Return air either 
dumped into the fan room via the return dampers in each branch duct or was exhausted via the smoke 
exhaust riser. A smoke exhaust damper opened at the shaft and the return dampers closed to exhaust 
smoke in the smoke purge mode. Curtain fire dampers were located throughout the building where 
ductwork crossed fire rated shaft walls, in accordance with the BCNYC. Separate pneumatic smoke 
dampers were used in the fan room to direct airflow within HVAC ductwork. 
Major changes/additions to the building HVAC systems were made during the SSB tenant retrofit.  AHUs 
were added to handle the increased air conditioning loads created by the extensive computer and data 
processing equipment.  Existing building systems were modified to add an increased make-up air 
capacity. A new, larger, make-up air shaft was added.  The shaft was relocated to create more usable 
space by allowing the removal of the original fan room on the trading floors and other select floors.  A 
transfer fan and ductwork were added to provide outside air to the existing outside air shaft in its original 
location below the 24th floor. 
In order to bring additional make-up air into the building, a large make-up AHU was installed in a new 
rooftop mechanical penthouse. This provided forced ventilation make-up air rather than the open shaft 
configuration present in the original building. Additional AHUs and exhaust fans were also located in the 
penthouse. 
A new smoke exhaust fan was added to replace the existing smoke purge fan. An additional smoke purge 
fan was also installed to provide smoke exhaust from the 45th through 47th floors of the building. 
Dedicated smoke exhaust fans were also provided for the trading room floors. 
Several new fan rooms were added to house the additional AHUs. A fan room was added at the midpoint 
of the west wall of WTC 7 on the SSB floors.  A louvered opening was provided to the exterior of the 
building from each fan room along the west wall.  Various types of HVAC equipment were located within 
these fan rooms, including kitchen exhaust fans serving the cafeteria spaces on the 34th and 41st floors. 
New fan rooms were also added to serve the two-story trading floors. The new fan rooms were located 
along the east wall of WTC 7, on the upper level of the trading floors (referred to as the mechanical 
mezzanine level). Fans within the east fan rooms returned air via ductwork from beneath the raised 
trading room floor, re-conditioned the air, and then supplied air at the upper level of the two-story space. 
Small FCUs were located beneath the raised floor to draw return air through the trading desks back into 
the raised-floor return plenum.

The SSB tenant modifications incorporated combination fire/smoke dampers at many locations within the 
HVAC ductwork in accordance with the BCNYC requirements for fire separation and to direct airflow 
within HVAC ductwork. 
E.3 
RELEVANT HISTORY 
Two major fire-related events in the history of the WTC complex resulted in building modifications that 
affected the spread of fire and smoke within WTC 1 and WTC 2 in the event of a fire, and had the 
potential to impact the smoke management systems installed in the towers. The first incident involved a 
major fire that occurred on the 11th floor of WTC 1 on February 14, 1975. The second incident resulted 
from a car bomb that exploded in the WTC complex parking garage on February 26, 1993, resulting in 
smoke spread throughout the towers. 
Three important engineering studies were performed pertaining to the smoke management systems in 
WTC 1 and WTC 2. A study of an early prototype stair pressurization system was performed in WTC 1. 
This study was examined to understand the feasibility of employing stair pressurization in the towers. 
Two engineering studies were performed subsequent to the 1993 bombing that examined the effectiveness 
of various smoke management approaches and recommended changes to the smoke management system 
design for the towers. 
E.3.1 
WTC 1 Fire–February 13, 1975 
On February 14, 1975, a fire occurred in WTC 1. The fire originated from an unknown source at 
approximately 11:30 p.m. in an office suite occupying roughly the entire southeast quadrant of the 
11th floor of the building. 
A worker noticed the fire and reported it to the WTC police headquarters. The city fire department was 
called; three policemen responded to the fire floor with a fire equipment cart (typically stationed in the 
44th and 78th floor sky lobbies of each tower), and the building engineer was advised to be prepared to 
put the HVAC system in the “purge” mode. When police reached the fire floor, they reported a serious 
fire and the HVAC system was placed in the purge mode. 
In accordance with New York City Local Law No. 5, the floor had been subdivided into quadrants via fire 
barriers, which contained the fire to the southeast quadrant of the building. The fire involved roughly 
9,000 ft2 of the 11th floor, destroying about half the contents and damaging the remainder of the contents 
in this area. Because fire barriers did not extend into the return plenum above the office space on each 
floor, hot smoke migrated around the perimeter of the floor within the open return plenum and was 
exhausted via the exhaust risers serving the other three quadrants of the building. The fire was eventually 
extinguished by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). 
The published accounts of the 1975 fire describe the use of the WTC 1 smoke purge sequence as an active 
fire protection measure used to improve conditions during the fire, as opposed to using the HVAC system 
purge as part of post-fire cleanup efforts. These reports document that during a fire, office areas could be 
put on 100 percent exhaust, with the core getting 100 percent supply, accomplished in 32 floor segments 
corresponding to a single HVAC zone. Because this sequence differs from the sequence of operations

xxxiv 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
listed in the building operations manuals with regard to the operation of the smoke purge sequence, it is 
unclear what the actual smoke purge sequence was at the time of the 1975 fire. 
The primary enhancement to WTC 1 and WTC 2 following the 1975 fire that impacted the issues of 
smoke movement and smoke management in the buildings was an improvement with regard to the 
provision of firestopping to unsealed vertical penetrations. The fire illustrated the ability of fire and 
smoke to spread vertically in high-rise buildings via unprotected vertical openings. 
E.3.2 
WTC Bombing–February 26, 1993 
On February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in a parking garage located in the sub-levels of the WTC 
complex. When the building HVAC systems shut down due to loss of electrical power, the building was 
subjected to extreme stack effect forces, since at the time of the bombing the outside temperature was in 
the twenties (degrees Fahrenheit). Because the explosion caused penetrations into several elevator shafts 
in WTC 1 on the sub-grade levels, in addition to creating openings into the lobby level, smoke was 
rapidly transported to the upper portions of the WTC 1 due to forces caused by the explosion and stack 
effect. 
A review committee was convened by the City of New York subsequent to the 1993 bombing that 
included representatives from the New York City Building and Fire Departments and the Port Authority 
of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port Authority). The committee concluded that the “complex 
issue of smoke control” was beyond the scope of the committee at that time and required future review. 
However, the committee recommended that building code requirements for smoke dampers should be 
clarified and that elevator lobbies should be provided in new high-rise buildings to resist the passage of 
smoke. Despite this recommendation, elevator lobbies are only required in high-rise residential buildings 
under the current provisions of the BCNYC. 
The report concluded that stair pressurization systems, not installed in the WTC towers, would not 
function in an incident involving a mass evacuation due to the simultaneous opening of more than three 
stairway doors. The report did conclude, however, that the BCNYC (Reference Standard 5-18) lacked 
regulatory provisions for periodic testing and maintenance of stair pressurization systems and 
recommended that these requirements be added. Finally, the committee report recommended that the 
issue of providing fire towers in new high-rise commercial office buildings be revisited. The requirement 
for fire towers (stairways separated from the interior environment of the building via open-air balconies) 
was included in the 1938 edition of the BCNYC, but removed in the 1968 edition of the code. Fire towers 
are not required under the current provisions of the BCNYC. 
A number of changes were eventually made to the buildings as a result of the committee’s 
recommendations.  Improvements were made to exiting, and a new fire alarm system was installed in 
each building.  In one published account of the 1993 bombing it was purported that emergency power was 
provided for smoke purge fans.  No other sources were found to corroborate this assertion. 
The 1993 bombing demonstrated that the stack effect could be a primary driver of rapid smoke spread 
through high-rise buildings.  The bombing showed that large amounts of smoke can be transmitted to the 
upper floors of a building due to a fire on the lower floor of the building, particularly when that fire 
produces a large quantity of smoke, such as was the case for the terrorist bombing.  The 1993 bombing 
Draft for Public Comment 
Executive Summary 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
xxxv 
also clearly demonstrated that, as expected, stack effect is enhanced by openings created in the vertical 
shafts within the building, such as stair and elevator shafts. 
Smoke spread via the stairways was substantial in the building during the 1993 event due to the large 
number of open stair doors occurring as a result of the mass evacuation of occupants in the building. The 
stairways, which were designed to provide an exit capacity that met or exceeded prevailing code 
requirements for the buildings, did not provide the exit capacity to ensure rapid egress of all of the 
occupants of the building. As a result, doors remained blocked open by building occupants 
entering/exiting the stairways, increasing the magnitude of the airflow up the stairs due to stack effect. 
The 1993 bombing also clearly showed the importance of emergency power to maintain the function of 
building systems, including emergency lighting systems, in the event of a fire. 
E.3.3 
Engineering Studies 
Several engineering studies were performed between the time the WTC complex was constructed and the 
WTC disaster to evaluate candidate smoke management system approaches for various areas of the 
complex. Three particular studies were conducted to examine smoke management systems in the towers 
(WTC 1 and WTC 2). These studies must be considered in the evaluation of the smoke management 
systems actually in place on September 11, 2001. 
Between 1976 and 1979, the Port Authority performed a study aimed at understanding the feasibility of 
providing stair pressurization systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2. Beginning in 1976, tests were run using 
building air handling systems located in the 7th floor MER and 41st floor MER of WTC 1, reconfigured 
to supply air to Stair 3. 
This stair pressurization system study examined stair pressurization system performance with the building 
HVAC systems in normal mode and smoke purge mode. At the time of the study, the smoke purge 
sequence was defined as pressurizing the core using core supply ventilation and exhausting the interior 
spaces using the low pressure return fans.  Perimeter supply/exhaust fans were shut down in purge mode. 
The study demonstrated that the system as designed was unable to meet the performance criteria outlined 
in Local Law No. 5. With three doors open, differential pressures were generally low. With doors closed, 
door opening forces were excessive. The study concluded that stair pressurization systems should be 
installed based on the prototype design, with modifications being made to the design as stair 
pressurization technology improved. Based on the results of the study, construction drawings were 
prepared outlining the proposed stair pressurization systems. 
Local Law No. 86 (enacted on December 13, 1979) stated that existing buildings shall be exempt from the 
smoke shaft and optional stair pressurization requirements if they were provided with automatic 
sprinklers throughout. A decision was made sometime after this date to fully sprinkler WTC 1 and 
WTC 2. As a result, stair pressurization systems were never installed in WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
Subsequent to the 1993 bombing, an analysis was performed by Rolf Jensen & Associates (RJA). The 
SMOKESIM computer model was used to verify and explain the movement of smoke in WTC 1 
following the explosion. The report also addressed the potential effectiveness of elevator venting, stair 
venting, and stair pressurization to improve conditions in the building. 
Executive Summary 
 
Draft for Public Comment 
xxxvi 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
The RJA report concluded that the results of the modeling generally agreed with the observed smoke 
spread given the wind/weather/damage conditions on February 26, 1993. The report also concluded that 
stair venting, defined as exhausting a stair using mechanical ventilation, was not an effective protection 
measure. Although stair venting decreased the amount of smoke migrating onto floor areas at the top of 
the building, it caused stack effect to be increased, and more smoke to be drawn into the stairs on the 
lower floors of the building. Elevator venting was found to improve overall conditions in the building. 
Stair pressurization was found to be feasible, and capable of maintaining adequate pressure with stair 
doors closed.  However, it was concluded that some sort of relief venting was needed at the top of each 
stair segment to relieve unacceptable door opening forces at the top of the stair shaft due to stack effect. 
This was particularly true for Stair 3, which had the longest stair segment uninterrupted by a horizontal 
transfer corridor. 
With or without overpressure relief, stair pressurization was found to be capable of maintaining a slightly 
positive pressure in the stair with several doors open.  However, as expected, positive pressure could not 
be maintained with all stair doors open, as would be the case in a mass evacuation scenario. 
During the same timeframe that RJA was conducting their smoke movement study (1994–1995), Hughes 
Associates, Inc. (HAI) and Dillon Consulting Engineers (DCE) were performing a joint study to examine 
potential configurations using the existing HVAC systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 to improve smoke 
control performance, without examining the provision of stair pressurization systems. The HAI/DCE 
study concluded that for most fire scenarios, a sequence involving pressurizing the core in the HVAC 
zone of fire origin and exhausting the perimeter office spaces (core pressurization) provided adequate 
smoke control performance. The study also strongly recommended that smoke management systems be 
activated automatically using smoke detectors installed in the building. This was a somewhat 
controversial recommendation, as automatic activation of smoke management systems is generally not 
allowed for high-rise buildings in New York City. 
The HAI/DCE report provided a recommended sequence of operations that could be used to better control 
smoke given an uncontrolled fire event on a floor that involves visible flame and heat exiting the building 
via broken windows. The approach involved placing all of the HVAC systems in the building on supply 
only and shutting down return fans. This approach effectively pressurizes the entire building and forces 
smoke out the broken windows on the fire floor. It was cautioned, however, that this approach should 
only have been used when occupants had already evacuated the fire floor and windows had been broken 
out due to the fire, as high door opening forces would have been created. 
E.4 
SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATION 
The purpose of this study was to document the design and installation of the smoke management systems 
in the towers (WTC 1 and WTC 2) and WTC 7 on September 11, 2001, and to compare the system 
designs to applicable code requirements. The designs were compared to the requirements of the BCNYC 
at the time of the event. 
In order to document the smoke management systems, multiple documents were reviewed in order to 
determine how the systems were designed and operated. In the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2, information 
obtained that documented the operation of smoke management systems presented conflicting versions of 
how the systems operated. In the case of WTC 7, the base building systems installed when the building

was constructed was modified/supplemented to add smoke management system capabilities during tenant 
retrofits. Instances where conflicting or incomplete information was provided are fully documented in this 
report. 
E.4.1 
WTC 1 AND WTC 2 
The tower buildings (WTC 1 and WTC 2) were equipped with a non-dedicated smoke management 
system (a smoke purge system).  Non-dedicated refers to the fact that the system utilized the base building 
HVAC systems that provided ventilation to the buildings under normal operating conditions, as opposed 
to a dedicated system that only existed for the purposes of smoke management.  No dedicated smoke 
management systems were installed in the buildings. 
The normal base building HVAC systems could be manually configured or operated in a smoke purge 
mode that allowed smoke to be removed from the building.  Smoke purge could only be accomplished for 
an entire ventilation zone served by a particular MER; thus, in the smoke purge mode the entire 
ventilation zone represents a single smoke zone.  Because no operable fire/smoke dampers were present 
within the ventilation ductwork, it was not possible to provide the smoke purge, or any other smoke 
management sequence, on a floor-by-floor basis. 
Smoke detectors were located at the exhaust duct inlets on each floor and within the HVAC system 
ductwork in the MER to provide automatic shutdown of individual fans in the presence of smoke. 
Automatic shutdown of the ventilation systems could be overridden in the smoke purge mode. 
The fire safety plan for WTC 1 and WTC 2, revised in January of 1999, defines smoke purge as the 
removal of smoke and other gaseous combustion products from the (fire) area “after a fire has been 
extinguished.” As documented in the fire safety plan, mechanical systems could be configured to perform 
the smoke purge function by the Port Authority mechanical section staff when requested by the chief 
officer of the responding FDNY units. The FDNY would ask the WTC fire safety director to provide a 
smoke purge for a given zone. The WTC fire safety director would then instruct the mechanical section 
staff to perform the requested action. 
The smoke purge sequence is documented in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23, Operation and 
Maintenance of Fire Protection System, dated February 1986. The documented sequence involves using 
the interior exhaust fans to exhaust an entire multi-floor ventilation zone. Based on the information 
contained in the fire safety plan for WTC 1 and WTC 2 and WTC Instruction Manual No. 23, it could be 
concluded that the buildings were equipped with a manual purge system that utilized the interior zone 
exhaust fans serving the four quadrants of the building to remove smoke after a fire was extinguished. 
Core supply/exhaust fans and perimeter supply fans would be shut down. Smoke purge could be 
accomplished within each HVAC zone, the largest of which had 32 floors. However, a number of sources 
were found containing conflicting information regarding how the smoke purge system functioned and 
how it was intended to be used. 
Accounts of the 1975 fire state that the smoke purge sequence pressurized the core with 100 percent 
outside air and exhausted 100 percent from the office spaces. These accounts also state that during the 
1975 fire, the smoke purge sequence for the fire floor and adjacent floors was initiated from the 
appropriate MER shortly after discovery of the fire, once police had examined the fire floor and identified 
the presence of a significant fire. This documented sequence of events is important, as it signifies that the

system was used at that time as an active fire protection system, to control smoke during the fire event 
and that the documented “core pressurization” mode differed from the sequence of operations. 
WTC Instruction Manual No. 23 makes the statement that “in the event of smoke in an interior tenant’s 
space involving personnel evacuation, the smoke purge procedure to be used is as follows…” In 
referencing an event involving personnel evacuation, this statement also implies use of the smoke purge 
sequence as an active fire protection sequence rather than a post-fire smoke cleanup sequence. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) report summarizing events on September 11, 2001, 
states (in Sec. 2.1.3.3) that, “a zoned smoke control system…was designed to limit smoke spread from the 
tenant areas to the core area, thereby assisting both individuals evacuating from an area and those 
responding to the scene by limiting smoke spread into the core.” Again, this statement implies an active 
smoke management system based on the concept of pressurizing the core, which conflicts with the 
documented smoke purge sequence for the buildings. 
The Port Authority was asked to clarify the operation of the smoke purge sequence, since the available 
information regarding its intended operation provides conflicting accounts of smoke purge operation. 
According to the Port Authority,1 the operation of the smoke purge sequence is as follows: 
During a fire/smoke incident, the fans stayed in operation until shut 
down by a smoke detector on interlocking exhaust fans or at the direction 
of FDNY. FDNY would also direct what mode of operation the fans 
should be in. If fans were still operating, as would often be the case, the 
engineer at FDNY direction would key over to purge mode. This would 
sequence spill dampers to open 100%. In addition, building operating 
procedure during a purge was to run the interior supply fans for purging 
[the] affected quadrant. During purge, the interior fan’s outside supply 
air dampers would go to 100% open. For example, during a smoke 
incident on 38NE in tower one, ACS 41-6 [northeast interior supply fan] 
would be operating on purge, outside damper open 100%. ACR 41-4,5 
and/or 6 [northeast interior return fans] would be operating on purge, 
spills open 100%. Core fans would not normally operate during a smoke 
purge unless conditions warranted and requested by FDNY. 
According to the Port Authority, smoke purge would occur by starting the supply and exhaust fans 
serving one of the four interior quadrants within a ventilation zone. Core supply/exhaust fans and 
perimeter supply fans would be shut down. HVAC systems serving the other ventilation zones in the 
building would be left operating unless they were shut down at the direction of FDNY. The Port 
Authority further recognized that WTC Instruction Manual No. 23 had not been updated since the base 
building fire alarm system was upgraded after the 1993 bombing. Therefore, this manual did not always 
reflect the most current fire protection system configuration. 
Operation of the smoke management system for WTC 1 and WTC 2 could be achieved by aligning the 
equipment within the individual MERs or at a central control panel located in the Operations Control

Center (OCC) on the B1 level of WTC 2. At either location, building personnel had to perform two 
distinct operations: 
1. Align the HVAC systems in smoke purge mode. 
2. Start the appropriate HVAC fans. 
Operation of the purge switch aligned all dampers that served as part of that quadrant’s HVAC systems in 
a 100 percent outside air configuration. This would mean that supply and spill dampers would be fully 
open and that return dampers would be closed. 
To achieve the smoke purge, it was up to the operator of the systems to turn on those fans necessary to 
achieve system operation. It would be equally possible to initiate an exhaust only type sequence as 
outlined in the fire safety plan, the core pressurization sequence (supply and exhaust operating) reportedly 
initiated during the 1975 fire, or the sequence stated by the Port Authority as the smoke purge sequence in 
effect on September 11, 2001. Alignment of the system would be up to the understanding of the operator 
as to the proper function of the smoke purge sequence, when called upon to initiate this sequence. 
With regard to the use of the smoke purge function to aid in active smoke management during a fire event 
versus during post-fire cleanup operations, it would be up to the responding fire department personnel to 
initiate system operation. Depending on the type of fire event, it is possible that the system could have 
been used either during the fire or after it was extinguished. 
For the purposes of this report, the function of the smoke purge system documented by the Port Authority 
was assumed to be in effect on September 11, 2001. It was also assumed that the system was to be used 
after the fire was extinguished, at the discretion of the responding fire department personnel. 
At the time the buildings were constructed, the ability to provide a smoke purge from each HVAC zone 
was the only smoke management system provided in the buildings. When it was enacted in 1973, Local 
Law No. 5 retroactively imposed the requirements for smoke shafts for existing high-rise buildings. In 
lieu of such smoke shaft(s), stair pressurization systems could be provided. 
In order to respond to the requirements of Local Law No. 5, the Port Authority initiated a pilot study into 
the requirements for pressurizing the exit stairs in WTC 1 and WTC 2. Stair pressurization was examined 
as a means of meeting the requirements of Local Law No. 5 since the smoke shaft requirements would 
have been prohibitive for a building the size of WTC 1 and WTC 2. Existing buildings that were 
sprinklered throughout were exempt from the smoke shaft and optional stair pressurization requirement 
by Local Law No. 86 (enacted in 1979). A decision was made at some subsequent time to fully sprinkler 
the WTC buildings. Therefore, the Port Authority did not move forward with the stair pressurization 
option. Because WTC 1 and WTC 2 were fully retrofitted with automatic sprinklers, smoke and heat 
venting and/or stair pressurization was not required in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were equipped throughout with fire dampers at duct penetrations into vertical shafts, 
as required by the BCNYC. Combination fire/smoke dampers were not required by the code to be 
provided in existing buildings. Since tenant retrofit projects generally connected to the existing base 
building systems, fire/smoke dampers at HVAC shafts were not generally provided during tenant retrofits.

As documented in Chapter 3, emergency power was not retroactively required by the BCNYC, but was 
provided following the 1993 bombing in WTC 1 and WTC 2 serving all emergency systems (lighting, fire 
alarm system, etc.) and the building elevators. While one account summarizing the building restoration 
activities following the 1993 bombing purported that emergency power was provided for smoke purge 
fans, the Port Authority stated that emergency power was not provided to WTC 1 and WTC 2 base 
building smoke purge fans. However, the MERs were equipped with redundant power sources from 
different substations. 
No other redundant features were identified with respect to the HVAC systems used to accomplish the 
smoke purge functions. No back-up systems or emergency power was provided. 
E.4.2 
WTC 7 
WTC 7 was designed with a dedicated smoke management system (a smoke purge system) that utilized 
dedicated HVAC equipment that served only a smoke management function. This type of system differed 
from that used in WTC 1 and WTC 2, which utilized the HVAC systems that provided normal ventilation 
to the buildings to perform the smoke purge function. In WTC 7, dedicated smoke exhaust fans/dampers 
could be manually aligned at the fire command center to provide smoke purge from a specified floor 
within the building. Since the smoke purge function could be provided on a floor-by-floor basis, each 
floor of the building constituted an individual smoke control zone. 
The building operations manual for WTC 7 specifies three alarm modes pertaining to operation of the 
building HVAC systems. ALARM-1 initiated shutdown of HVAC equipment based on duct smoke 
detection. ALARM-2 initiated smoke purge on the affected floor. ALARM-3 specified the smoke purge 
sequence for non-affected floors. The smoke management sequence pertaining to the smoke purge 
function involved exhausting the fire floor and pressurizing the remaining floors with supply air. 
Local Law No. 16 required that all buildings in occupancy group E (business) be provided a manual 
override capability to exhaust one floor at a time at a rate of 6 air changes per hour, or 1 cfm/ft2, 
whichever is greater. For WTC 7, with a footprint area of approximately 40,000 ft2, this would require an 
exhaust capacity of at least 48,000 ft3/min (81,552 m3/h). The base building system serving the lower 
floors (up to the 23rd floor) of the building provided a smoke exhaust capacity of 36,000 ft3/min 
(61,164 m3/h), which is not consistent with the minimum value specified by code. An 84,000 ft3/min 
(142,716 m3/h) exhaust fan was provided for the SSB floors during the tenant retrofit. 
WTC 7 was sprinklered throughout and was therefore exempted from the requirement for stair 
pressurization systems. The building was provided with a Class E fire alarm system per code, was 
provided with emergency power serving all emergency systems, and was equipped throughout with fire 
dampers at duct penetrations into vertical shafts.

EVALUATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
The purpose of this study was to document the normal operation of the fully functional smoke 
management systems on smoke conditions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. Elements 
involved the evaluation of expected system performance for postulated design fires in business

occupancies, as well as documentation of the expected performance of fully functional smoke 
management systems in the towers. 
The smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 were designed to provide a manual smoke purge 
function. Given the design and intended operation of the smoke management systems, two key questions 
must be answered to approximate the performance of the system on September 11, 2001: 
1. Was manual operation of the smoke purge systems in either WTC 1 or WTC 2 initiated by 
emergency response personnel? 
2. Were the systems capable of operating given the damage caused by the aircraft impacts on 
each building? 
In order to answer the second question, damage to both the building electrical and mechanical systems 
had to be evaluated. It had to be determined whether electrical power was available to the building 
mechanical systems subsequent to impact so that they were capable of operating. Then, potential damage 
to HVAC system components had to be evaluated to determine whether the systems were capable of 
performing as designed. 
E.5.1 
Actions of Emergency Response Personnel 
The events of September 11, 2001, clearly represented an extraordinary challenge, both to emergency 
response personnel, and to the installed building systems. The damage caused by an aircraft impact into a 
building is outside the range of typical design considerations for most building systems, including fire 
protection systems. In addition, from a fire department perspective, a fire involving multiple floors of the 
uppermost portion of WTC 1 or WTC 2, or worse in both buildings simultaneously, represents a difficult 
operational environment. 
As documented in Chapter 7, the WTC fire safety director on duty on September 11, 2001 stated that no 
recommendation was given on his part to initiate a smoke purge sequence, nor was smoke purge 
performed on September 11, 2001, to his knowledge. There is no record of FDNY personnel having 
initiated a smoke purge sequence in WTC 1 or WTC 2. 
Radio and phone traffic from various sources was reviewed in an effort to determine if any attempts were 
made to manipulate building ventilation systems or initiate the smoke purge sequence locally from one of 
the MERs in WTC 1 or WTC 2.  One reference to smoke purging was found where a maintenance worker 
reporting heavy smoke from “Stair A” on the 103rd floor in WTC 1 transmitted the message “Need 
immediate purge.” At roughly the same time, an unidentified male was recorded on the same radio 
channel transmitting the message “Electric, we have Staircase C (inaudible), is there any way to pump 
any outdoor air in?”  No conversations were identified confirming use of the ventilation systems. 
E.5.2 
Damage to System Components 
The exact extent of damage within individual floors of WTC 1 and WTC 2 may never be known because 
the collapse of the buildings prohibited a detailed inspection of the impact area. However, the potential 
extent of damage was estimated based on the results of engineering analysis and based on observations 
recorded by people located within WTC 1 and WTC 2 at the time of the events. 
Executive Summary 
 
Draft for Public Comment

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
Potential damage estimates were overlaid onto representative floor plans for the impact areas in WTC 1 
and WTC 2 in order to determine the potential damage to key electrical/mechanical system components 
located in the core spaces.  The damage estimates were corroborated to a certain extent by observations of 
people in various locations in the buildings after aircraft impact.  The observers primarily described stair 
shaft damage, damage to freight elevator 50, and in some cases elevator shafts.  HVAC shaft conditions 
could be corroborated by visual evidence of smoke spread seen from the exterior of the building.  An 
attempt was also made to corroborate the extent of core damage using observations of the presence of 
power in the building. 
Numerous accounts were recorded of all three exit stairs in WTC 1 being blocked on the 92nd floor and 
above.  The extent of damage into the core of WTC 1 is also evidenced by damage to elevator shafts in 
the core, particularly freight elevator 50. A notable event occurring in WTC 1 was a reported 
“explosion/fireball” that occurred in the lobby of WTC 1 due to jet fuel that was ignited at the base of an 
elevator shaft. This is further evidence of core damage as far in as the express elevator shafts. 
In WTC 2, the core layout was such that the three exit stairs were located remotely from one another on 
the impact floors. As a result, the aircraft impact left the northwest stair in the building (Stair 1) relatively 
undamaged. At least four survivors were able to safely exit the building via Stair 1 from floors as high as 
the 91st floor. However, given that damage to two out of three exit stairs was substantiated by survivor 
testimony and that significant damage was caused to the exterior walls in the northeast corner of WTC 2, 
the path of damage would also logically include the ventilation shafts located on the east half of the 
impact floors. 
Potential damage to the HVAC shafts was also determined to some degree by examining photographic 
evidence depicting the exterior of the buildings after the time of aircraft impact. Initial damage estimates 
support the hypothesized damage to the HVAC shafts in one-half of each building within the impact zone. 
The damage would have created large holes in the gypsum wallboard exhaust shafts and potentially shear 
off or collapse metal supply ductwork. If the HVAC shafts were undamaged, the fire dampers at the 
HVAC shaft walls would have been expected to close in an intense fire, limiting the extent of airflow via 
the ventilation shafts. Fire dampers would not be expected to be as effective in limiting smoke spread as 
combination fire/smoke dampers, which are designed to be smoke-tight and close earlier in the fire event. 
In WTC 1, spread of large amounts of smoke via the ventilation shafts was evident in the examination of 
pictures of the exterior of WTC 1 subsequent to impact.  A significant amount of smoke can be seen 
exiting the 108th floor MER from a localized area on the north face of the building and along the length 
of the west face of the building.  At the 108th floor MER in WTC 1, the smoke emanating from the north 
face of the building corresponds to the location of the supply fan inlet for the northwest interior supply 
zone.  The exhaust plenum for the northwest quadrant exhaust fans is located along the west face of the 
MER.  The visual evidence supports damage to the primary ventilation shaft serving the northwest 
quadrant of the impact zone. 
Since the damage estimate suggests similar damage to the northeast shaft, a similar pattern of smoke 
exiting the 108th floor MER would be expected to be seen at the northeast supply inlet and east exhaust 
outlets.  However, due to the direction of the wind driven smoke plume from the fire toward the 
southeast, it is difficult to see patterns of smoke emanating from the MER at this location on the exterior 
of the building.  Therefore, large amounts of smoke exiting supply/ventilation shafts serving the northeast 
quadrant of the impact zone, which would substantiate the shaft damage to the northeast quadrant

Executive Summary

xliii 
ventilation shafts, could not be verified from visual observations of the exterior of the building, as the 
smoke plumes obscured views of this area of the building. 
Once smoke enters the ventilation ductwork, it can very quickly spread to all areas of the upper floors of 
the building via the air distribution plenum in the ceiling.  This is contrasted to smoke entering a floor via 
elevator doors, which might have to pass through multiple barriers in the core and office space to reach 
the perimeter offices. As a result, smoke spread via the ventilation shafts has the potential to cause a more 
rapid deterioration of smoke conditions in the perimeter office spaces than smoke spread via the elevator 
and stair shafts. 
The hypothesized rapid spread of smoke vertically via the ventilation shafts in WTC 1 is supported by the 
fact that smoke conditions became untenable (high heat/high toxicity) to the extent that people trapped on 
the uppermost floors of WTC 1 were observed breaking windows to obtain outdoor air and some jumped 
from the building to escape the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the building shortly after impact in 
WTC 1. The FDNY noted people jumping from the building shortly after their arrival in the lobby of 
WTC 1. 
In WTC 2, shaft damage (stair/elevator/ventilation shafts) would also have caused smoke to spread 
upward through the building. However, in WTC 2 the ventilation shaft above the 83rd floor impact 
terminated at the 91st floor.  This prevented a direct pathway for the smoke to follow to the upper floors. 
Smoke would have to spread upward into the building to floors above the 91st floor through the other 
primary vertical airflow paths, which were limited primarily to the local elevator banks. 
The fact that there were relatively few vertical airflow paths between the impact zone in WTC 2 and the 
uppermost floors of the building is supported by the length of time conditions remained tenable in some 
areas of the upper floors of the building. Numerous occupants of WTC 2 were trapped on the upper floors 
of the building, and several people used their cell phones to call family members. The experience of 
occupants on the upper floors of the building supports the fact that spaces in the uppermost portion of 
WTC 2 were tenable for periods as long as 45 min after impact. 
An attempt was made to identify the presence or lack of power to the MER floors serving the impact 
zones in WTC 1 and WTC 2 by using survivor testimony and transcripts of phone calls made by people 
trapped above the impact zone. Little evidence was available regarding the presence of electrical power, 
particularly on the upper floors of the buildings. Isolated reports were noted of “lights flickering” and 
going out in the buildings. These accounts also corresponded to floors where ceiling collapse and other 
minor structural damage was noted. Therefore, loss of lighting could have coincided with local structural 
damage rather than being indicative of an overall loss of electrical power. Despite the lack of definitive 
survivor testimony with regard to the presence of electrical power in WTC 1 and WTC 2, estimates 
support damage to one or more of the electrical closets/risers in each building. In WTC 1, damage likely 
occurred to both the north and central electrical closets/risers.  In WTC 2, damage likely occurred to at 
least the east electrical closet/riser. 
E.5.3 
Summary of System Performance on September 11, 2001 
Examination of the available evidence provides strong indications that the smoke management systems in 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 played no role in the events that occurred on September 11, 2001. There is no 
evidence to support the fact that an attempt was made to activate the smoke purge sequence. In the chaos

following the aircraft impacts and preceding the collapse of the buildings, the focus was on rescue 
operations rather than on manipulation of building systems. 
Should a decision have been made to attempt to align the building ventilation systems into the smoke 
purge mode, it is doubtful that this would have had any impact on overall smoke conditions within the 
building. Upon arriving at the scene FDNY personnel had a difficult time determining the exact floors of 
impact, especially for WTC 1. Since the WTC 1 impact occurred near the boundary between ventilation 
zones at the 91st/92nd floors, and the impact was thought to have originally occurred on floors 
somewhere between the 80th and 90th floors (Smith 2002), smoke purge may have been inadvertently 
initiated for the 59th–91st floor HVAC zone in WTC 1. 
The aircraft impacts caused significant damage to the core spaces in both WTC 1 and WTC 2, making it 
unlikely that the smoke purge could have been accomplished in either building. In WTC 1, it is likely that 
the impact eliminated or significantly impaired electrical power on floors above the impact zone. 
Therefore, because power would not have been available at the 108th floor MER (which served the zone 
of impact), HVAC systems would not have been operational. In addition, the ventilation shafts for at least 
the north half of the building were likely damaged, thus reducing the possibility for the smoke purge to 
function properly even if the HVAC systems had been operable. 
In WTC 2, it is possible that electrical power may have been available to the fans located in the 75th floor 
MER, which was located below the impact zone in this building. Survivor testimony indicates that power 
may have been available up to the 75th floor. Initially, all fans would have shut down due to detection of 
substantial quantities of smoke by the duct smoke detectors. Damage estimates suggest that the HVAC 
shafts utilized to accomplish smoke purging would likely have been damaged on the east side of the 
building, eliminating half of the smoke venting capacity for the floor. Even if the ventilation shafts on the 
west side of the building remained intact, the performance of the smoke venting system would have been 
reduced. Damage to HVAC shafts had a particularly detrimental impact on WTC 1, where smoke 
conditions deteriorated in the uppermost portions of the building at a much faster rate than WTC 2. 
E.6 
EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
EFFECTIVENESS 
In order to fully understand the potential impact of smoke management systems for events like those 
occurring on September 11, 2001, it is important to analyze how various smoke management system 
configurations might have performed in WTC 1 and WTC 2, had they been available on September 11, 
2001. To develop an understanding of the capabilities of the various smoke management system 
configurations that were evaluated, it is also important to analyze their performance for other hypothetical 
fire scenarios in high-rise buildings, both typical/expected design scenarios and worst case scenarios. All 
of the smoke management approaches analyzed utilized some variation of the pressurization method of 
smoke management. The pressurization method is the smoke management system design method for 
well-compartmented structures with low-ceiling spaces. 
The performance of each of the smoke management approaches, given the postulated design fire 
scenarios, was evaluated using the CONTAM building airflow and contaminant dispersal model, 
developed by NIST. CONTAM is a recognized tool for the evaluation of smoke management systems that 
are based on the pressurization method of smoke management. Based on a review of the various issues 
Draft for Public Comment 
Executive Summary 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
xlv 
relating to the use of tenability (dilution) analysis, it was determined that the performance of the candidate 
smoke management approaches would be evaluated based solely on the ability to provide pressure 
differentials consistent with the pressurization method of smoke control. 
The various codes and standards that reference the use of pressurization smoke control require the 
provision of 0.05 in. H2O (12.5 Pa) pressure differentials in sprinklered buildings and 0.1 in. H2O (25 Pa) 
in non-sprinklered buildings to contain smoke. It is important to note, however, that these pressures are 
measured with a building’s HVAC systems placed in smoke management mode, without the presence of a 
fire. The required pressure differentials are high enough to contain heated smoke were a fire to be present 
in sprinklered and non-sprinklered occupancies, and are used for design purposes. Since the modeling 
performed using CONTAM includes the temperature of the fire compartment as a parameter in the model, 
it is only necessary that the system maintain a positive pressure differential to contain smoke when the 
barrier across which the pressure is maintained is fairly tight. For barriers containing large openings, 
creation of a positive pressure differential may not be sufficient to contain smoke. Unless sufficient 
airflow velocity is applied to hold back the smoke, two-way flow will occur. Heated smoke will flow 
from the fire compartment at the uppermost portion of the large opening, and pressurization air will be 
introduced into the fire compartment through the lower portion of the large opening. 
The CONTAM model of WTC 1 that was constructed as part of the 1996 HAI/DCE study was used as the 
baseline to which modifications were made to perform the modeling effort documented in this report. As 
part of the 1996 study, calibration measurements were made of actual airflows and pressure differentials 
obtained at various locations in WTC 1 for different ventilation modes. For the current modeling effort, 
the 1996 calibration data were reviewed, and an attempt was made to better calibrate the model to match 
the data. Limitations relating to the calibration data included several uncertainties that existed with regard 
to the accuracy of the reported data, and the determination of the exact configuration of the building 
(openings and HVAC system alignment) at the time the calibration measurements were made. 
After extensive effort, it was determined that a single building configuration could not be developed that 
conclusively matched the 1996 calibration data. The primary obstacle was the existence of too many 
independent variables (leakage types, wind/weather conditions, HVAC system alignments, design versus 
measured supply/return airflow, unknown architectural changes to individual floor plans) to allow for a 
single building model that matched all of the data for the various ventilation modes. It was determined 
that in order to accurately represent the uncertainty involved in the type of modeling being performed, 
and the potential range of results given this uncertainty, three separate building configurations would be 
used in the modeling. Examining the CONTAM results for a particular fire scenario/smoke management 
approach for the three building configurations as a group enabled an assessment of whether smoke 
management may have been effective for that fire scenario. 
E.6.1 
Smoke Management System Approaches 
Five distinct smoke management approaches were examined for the WTC towers. These approaches are 
as follows: 
1. Smoke Purge 
2. Core Pressurization 
Executive Summary

xlvi 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
3. Building Pressurization 
4. Sandwich Pressurization 
5. Zoned Smoke Control with Stair Pressurization 
The smoke purge approach is based on the documented smoke purge sequence for WTC 1 and WTC 2 as 
it appears in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23, Operation and Maintenance of Fire Protection System, 
dated February 1986. The sequence involved placing the interior HVAC zone exhaust fans and core 
exhaust fans (toilet exhausts, elevator machine room [EMR] exhausts) in the multi-floor ventilation zone 
containing the fire in 100 percent exhaust mode. HVAC systems in all other ventilation zones in the 
buildings were aligned in a summer normal mode.  Perimeter supply fans were shut down. 
The core pressurization approach is a slight variation of the documented smoke purge sequence for 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, in that rather than the exhaust fans in the core, the core supply fans were activated to 
prohibit smoke spread into the core from the surrounding office spaces. Accounts of the 1975 fire and 
other sources cite this variation as being the “smoke purge” sequence provided for the building. 
The building pressurization approach is an approach that was recommended in the 1996 HAI/DCE study. 
This approach was recommended to be used in the event of a severe fire involving a substantial portion of 
one floor of the building, where windows were observed to be broken out. The approach involves turning 
on the supply fans in the entire building and turning on the exhaust fans only in the ventilation zone of 
fire origin. The intent of this approach was to exhaust smoke where possible from the floor containing the 
fire, and to induce a substantial airflow toward the floor of fire origin to force smoke out of the broken 
windows. 
The sandwich pressurization approach was not previously examined for WTC 1 and WTC 2 in any of the 
engineering studies reviewed in the preparation of this report. The approach analyzed is not the classic 
floor-by-floor sandwich approach, which involves exhausting the floor of fire origin and pressurizing the 
floors above and below. The HVAC systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 were not equipped with operable 
fire/smoke dampers; thus, it was not possible to configure the system to exhaust and supply to only single 
floors within a ventilation zone. Instead, an approach was examined where the sandwich was achieved by 
ventilation zones. In the event of a fire, the ventilation zone of origin would have all of its exhaust fans 
turned on, and supply fans turned off. The ventilation zones above and below would have all supply fans 
activated and exhaust fans turned off. These actions would create a multi-floor sandwich effect in the 
building, with the net effect being the creation of a pressure differential between the core and perimeter 
spaces within the HVAC zone of fire origin. 
The final approach analyzed, zoned smoke control with stair pressurization, was an approach based on 
best practices in smoke management system design enforced in many jurisdictions in the United States as 
of September 11, 2001. It was assumed that the building was retrofitted with stair pressurization systems, 
as required for all new high-rise construction by the major building codes in the United States, and was 
capable of exhausting on a floor by floor basis within the ventilation zone containing the fire to create the 
desired pressure differential with respect to the floors above and below. Other ventilation zones were 
assumed to operate in the summer normal mode. It was assumed that operable fire/smoke dampers were 
also installed in all supply/exhaust ducts at the appropriate shaft connections and that these dampers were 
closed within the zone of fire origin.

E.6.2 
Design Fire Scenarios 
Several different design fire scenarios were evaluated for WTC 1 and WTC 2, encompassing the range of 
expected fires that could be envisioned within the office spaces of the building. The fire scenarios were 
limited to those that could occur on the above-grade office floors of the building. Other possible fire 
scenarios could result in smoke migration through the towers due to a fire in the sub-grade areas or 
adjacent spaces within the WTC complex (i.e., truck dock fire, car fire in the garage, fire in the 
concourse). Because the focus of this report is on examining the fires that occurred on September 11, 
2001, (which occurred on the uppermost floors of the building) and bounding these events with other 
comparable fires, it was relevant to examine only those fire scenarios on the office floors of the building. 
The design fire scenarios that were evaluated are as follows: 
1. Sprinklered Fire 
2. Full-Floor Burnout 
3. Two-Floor Fire 
4. WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (No Shaft Damage) 
5. WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (Shaft Damage Assumed) 
The first fire scenario assumes that a typical fire in a sprinklered building would typically involve only a 
single fuel package, or a small number of adjacent fuel packages, and would either be controlled by the 
automatic sprinkler system, or be extinguished. A simplifying assumption is to assume that the 
temperature in the zone of origin never exceeds the operation temperature of the sprinklers, which were 
assumed to have an activation temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). Given the large size of the majority of the 
office spaces in the towers, some of which encompassed an entire floor, the average temperature 
throughout the floor would be expected to be less than the assumed 165 °F. 
The second fire scenario, the full-floor burnout scenario, is a design scenario for a fire involving the 
contents of a typical office building floor.  In a fully-sprinklered building, a full-floor burnout would only 
be possible with some sort of catastrophic failure of the sprinkler system, or with a fuel load that exceeds 
the capacity of the sprinkler system.  The full-floor burnout scenario is essentially the same as the 
“uncontrolled fire” scenario analyzed in the 1996 HAI/DCE study. The full floor burnout fire scenario 
evaluated in this report assumed a temperature on the floor of fire origin of 1,800 °F (1,000 °C), 
consistent with the temperature assumed in the 1996 report for fully involved fires. This fire scenario 
assumed that 58 windows on each face (as assumed in the 1996 study) were broken out. This provided a 
sufficient influx of air to sustain roughly a 250 MW fire. 
The third fire scenario, the two-floor fire scenario, corresponds to a multi-floor event caused by a small 
explosion. The purpose of this fire scenario was to examine smoke management system performance for a 
multi-floor fire scenario of far less severity than the aircraft impact caused on September 11, 2001. This 
scenario also challenges the typical floor-to-floor separation that exists in typical building fire scenarios 
due to an intact floor slab. The fire scenario assumes that a small explosion has opened up a 100 ft2 (9.3 
m2) hole in the floor slab at the midpoint along one of the faces of the building. The explosion does no 
damage to the core but causes half the windows on the near face of the building to be blown out by the

blast. It is assumed that sprinkler piping may be damaged, but some sprinklers operate, to reduce the 
overall temperature on the two open floors of the building. The average temperature on the two floors is 
assumed to be identical to that of the sprinklered fire scenario, 165 °F (74 °C). 
The fourth fire scenario was used to model smoke management system performance under the conditions 
in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. Estimates of the size of the exterior openings after aircraft 
impact including impact damage and window breakage, were used along with the preliminary damage 
estimates to model the damage conditions existing within each building.  Where the extent of damage was 
unknown, estimates regarding the extent of damage were used.  The sensitivity of the model was checked 
to determine how the results would vary for wide variations to the assumed extent of damage. For 
example, the size of the hole between floors within the impact zone was difficult to estimate.  The models 
used a floor opening equal to the footprint of the impact damage depicted in the NIST damage figures up 
to, but not including, the core.  Several estimates of the temperature within the impact zone in the towers 
were made. It is estimated that the temperature may have been as low as 750 °F (400 °C) in some areas of 
the impact zone and as high as 1,800 °F (1,000 °C) in the hottest areas of the impact zone. Both the lower 
cited temperature and the upper cited temperature were used to model the temperature throughout the 
impact zone. For all cases, the outside air temperature was modeled as 70 °F (21 °C) with the wind out of 
the north at 11.2 mph (5 m/s). 
The fifth and final fire scenario was a hypothetical fire scenario in which the majority of the structural 
damage occurring on September 11, 2001, was modeled, but with no damage occurring to the building’s 
core. This scenario, although unlikely, was modeled to estimate the performance of the candidate smoke 
management system approaches for a scenario involving a multi-floor fire event with high temperatures 
throughout the fire compartment and large openings in the exterior of the building. 
E.6.3 
Results of the Analysis 
The five candidate smoke management system approaches were evaluated to determine whether these 
approaches could provide adequate pressurization to confine smoke to the zone of fire origin for the five 
postulated fire scenarios. 
The smoke purge and the core pressurization approaches were shown to create adequate pressure 
differentials for only the sprinklered fire scenario. Substantial negative pressure differentials, indicating 
flow of smoke from the zone of fire origin into the core, occurred for the other fire scenarios. 
The building pressurization approach created high pressure differentials from the core to the perimeter 
office spaces for all fire scenarios except the multi-floor September 11 aircraft impact scenarios. Positive 
pressures were demonstrated for both the undamaged core and shaft damage September 11 scenarios in 
WTC 1, but sufficient airflow velocity was not created to prohibit smoke spread via large openings in 
ventilation shafts and in the core/office space boundaries resulting from aircraft impact damage. Use of 
the building pressurization method could potentially create excessive door opening forces that could 
hinder or prohibit the egress of building occupants. The magnitude of the door opening forces is a 
function of the fire scenario, size of interior and exterior openings, and location of the floor(s) of fire 
origin relative to the location of the MER. 
The zoned smoke control with stair pressurization approach was shown to be effective for the sprinklered 
fire scenario, the full-floor burnout, and the two-floor fire. For each of these fire scenarios, however, stack

effect was shown to have a substantial impact on the performance of the system, in some cases causing 
airflow from the floor of fire origin into the core. Therefore, this approach might not be effective using a 
single speed fan, or a fixed airflow quantity. It is likely that fan speed would have to be adjusted based on 
differential pressure readings to ensure the success of a smoke management system using this approach. 
Because the zoned smoke control method involves exhausting from a single floor of the building, it was 
not effective for the multi-floor aircraft impact scenarios. In addition, stair pressurization did not prohibit 
smoke spread into the stairs when large openings in the stairway walls were present due to aircraft impact 
damage. 
The sandwich pressurization approach was determined to be effective for the sprinklered fire, full-floor 
burnout, and two-floor fire scenarios, even in the presence of stack effect. Positive pressures were 
demonstrated in the model scenarios for both the undamaged core and shaft damage September 11 
scenarios in WTC 1, but sufficient airflow velocity was not created to prohibit smoke spread via large 
openings into ventilation shafts or the core resulting from aircraft impact damage.

SUMMARY 
The following results were reported to NIST by the contractor based on the information and analysis 
documented in this report: 
• 
The smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2, which provided the capability for a 
manual smoke purge within an individual HVAC zone on a quadrant-by-quadrant basis, were 
not initiated on September 11, 2001. 
• 
Had the smoke purge sequence been initiated in WTC 1 or WTC 2, it is unlikely the system 
would have functioned as designed, due to loss of electrical power and/or damage to the 
HVAC shafts and other structural elements in the impact zone. 
• 
Provision of active smoke management systems and/or combination fire/smoke dampers was 
not required by the 1968 BCNYC or retroactive provisions in the various local laws enacted 
after WTC 1 and WTC 2 were constructed for existing high-rise buildings provided with 
automatic sprinklers throughout. 
• 
None of the potential smoke management system configurations evaluated in this report 
would have provided sufficient pressure differentials to contain smoke for the postulated 
aircraft impact damage scenarios, even if these systems were capable of operation after the 
building sustained damage from the aircraft impact. 
• 
The smoke purge sequence in existence on or before September 11, 2001, would have been 
expected to be capable of limiting the spread of smoke from the zone of fire origin only for 
fire scenarios in which the sprinkler system was operational and controlled the fire. Other 
smoke management strategies capable of being implemented using the existing WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 ventilation systems may also have been capable of controlling smoke from the 
postulated full-floor burnout and two-floor fire scenarios evaluated in this report had these 
strategies been identified and implemented into the sequence of operations.

• 
During the events occurring on September 11, 2001, stair pressurization likely would have 
been ineffective in improving conditions for occupants trying to exit the building. 
• 
Installation of combination fire/smoke dampers in HVAC ductwork, which was not required 
in WTC 1 or WTC 2, would have acted to slow the development of hazardous conditions on 
the uppermost floors of the building, but would likely not have had a significant effect on the 
ability of occupants to egress the building due to the impassibility of the exit stairways.

SCOPE 
The work described in this report is in support of the investigation of active fire protection systems. The 
purpose of this project is to investigate the performance of the active fire protection systems in World 
Trade Center (WTC) 1, 2, and 7 and their role in fire control, emergency response, and fate of occupants 
and responders.  Information related to the overall scope or results of the analysis of active fire protection 
systems may be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NCSTAR 1-4.1

OBJECTIVES 
This effort involves evaluation of the design, installation, and performance of the smoke management 
systems installed in WTC 1, 2, and 7. Specific objectives associated with this effort include the following: 
• 
Document the design and installation of the smoke management systems and compare 
designs to applicable code and standards requirements. 
• 
Document the normal operation of the fully functional smoke management systems, and its 
potential effect on smoke conditions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. 
In order to establish a context in which to evaluate the WTC smoke management systems, Chapter 1 
provides an overview of smoke management system concepts. Chapter 2 of this report summarizes the 
various considerations impacting smoke management system design, along with a brief history of the 
development of smoke control related requirements within various national codes and standards. Chapter 
3 summarizes the local Building Code of the City of New York (BCNYC) requirements and compares 
these code requirements to applicable national codes and standards. 
Chapter 4 provides a brief building description of WTC 1, 2, and 7, with a focus on the building 
ventilation systems, which are the key components in a building’s smoke management systems. Other 
building elements impacting smoke movement and control are also described in this chapter. 
Two major fire-related events in the history of the WTC complex had an impact on decisions that affect 
the spread of fire and smoke within WTC 1 and WTC 2 in the event of a fire, and had the potential to 
impact the smoke management systems installed in the towers. The first incident involved a major fire 
that occurred on the 11th floor of WTC 1 on February 14, 1975. The second incident resulted from a car 
bomb that exploded in the WTC complex parking garage on February 26, 1993, resulting in smoke spread 
throughout the towers. Chapter 5 provides a summary of these two events and discusses changes to the

buildings made subsequent to each event impacting smoke movement and control. Chapter 5 also 
summarizes two engineering studies performed subsequent to the 1993 bombing that recommended 
changes to the tower smoke management system design, as well as a study of an early proto-type stair 
pressurization system. 
Chapter 6 addresses the documentation of the smoke management systems (if any) provided in WTC 1, 2, 
and 7. Chapter 6 also compares the installed systems to the requirements contained in the applicable 
codes and standards. 
Chapter 7 addresses the documentation of the normal operation of the fully functional smoke management 
systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2, and its potential effect on smoke conditions in the towers on 
September 11, 2001. 
Chapter 8 discusses the use of the CONTAM building airflow and contaminant dispersal computer model 
to evaluate the performance of several smoke management system configurations in the towers under 
specified fire scenarios. These fire scenarios included the severe aircraft impact related events that played 
out on September 11, 2001, as well as less severe fire scenarios typical of business occupancies. This 
additional modeling was performed in an effort to provide analysis that can be used to support one of the 
overall objectives of the NIST-led investigation, the identification of areas in current building and fire 
codes, standards, and practices that may warrant revision. 
Chapter 9 provides a discussion of the analysis and conclusions reached by this report.

PRIMARY TASKS 
Task 1: Document the design and installation of the smoke management systems and compare designs to 
applicable code and standard requirements. 
The necessary input required to evaluate the performance of the installed smoke management systems in 
WTC 1, 2, and 7 required detailed documentation of what was in each building on September 11, 2001, as 
well as applicable code requirements. This required review of Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey documents, system operations manuals, drawings, and other relevant documents. Task 1 involved 
identification and documentation of such information at the greatest level of detail possible in order to 
address issues of performance in the follow-on tasks. 
This task had several elements, including the following: 
• 
Documentation of the smoke management strategies employed within the buildings and the 
location of smoke control zones designated by the system designs 
• 
Documentation of the location and function of the major components of the smoke 
management system, including air handlers, ducts, dampers, and shafts 
• 
Documentation of smoke management system sequences of operation and automatic 
initiating devices (if any) 
• 
Documentation of smoke management control panel locations and design

BACKGROUND 
2.1 
SMOKE MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 
Smoke management is a term used interchangeably with smoke control to define the use of active or 
passive means to minimize and control smoke movement within a building in the event of a fire. Active 
smoke management generally involves the use of ventilation systems to control the movement of smoke. 
Passive smoke management generally involves the use of smoke barriers to provide compartmentalization 
within a building to minimize smoke spread.  Although some attempts have been made by design 
professionals to attach different meanings (and implied performance) to differentiate management from 
control, these terms are considered to have the same meaning for the purposes of this report. 
The objectives of smoke management systems are generally defined in the codes and standards in terms 
of meeting life safety objectives with regard to the occupants of a building; although, there are instances 
where a smoke management system may be used to provide property protection or aid in fire department 
operations and post-fire clean-up. 
The primary references used by professionals involved in designing state-of-the-art smoke management 
systems are: 
• 
Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002), published by the American 
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 
• 
NFPA 92A, Smoke Control Systems, published by the National Fire Protection Association 
(NFPA) 
• 
NFPA 92B, Guide for Smoke Management Systems in Malls, Atria, and Large Areas, 
published by NFPA 
Another valuable technical reference is the book Smoke Movement and Control in High-Rise Buildings, 
authored by George T. Tamura, who conducted pioneering research in smoke control at the National 
Research Council Canada (NRCC). 
2.1.1 
Definition of Important Terms 
Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) System—Within the context of smoke management 
system design, the system of fans, dampers, and ductwork that distributes air to and from the spaces 
within a building. 
Fire Damper—A multi-blade device located within HVAC system ductwork that is equipped with a 
spring-loaded fusible element that when exposed to heated air/smoke above a specified design 
temperature will close to prohibit fire propagation to adjacent spaces via the ductwork. In the 
United States, fire dampers are generally required to conform with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 
Chapter 2

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
Standard 555, Standard for Safety Fire Dampers. Fire dampers are not generally designed to be air-tight 
nor to prohibit the passage of smoke. 
Smoke Barrier—A continuous membrane, either vertical or horizontal, such as a wall, floor, or ceiling 
assembly, that is designed and constructed to restrict the movement of smoke (NFPA 2000b). A smoke 
barrier may or may not be required to have a fire-resistance rating. 
Smoke Damper—A multi-blade device located within HVAC system ductwork that functions similarly to 
a fire damper, but in addition is equipped with a local smoke detector that will cause the damper to close 
when the presence of smoke is detected. In lieu of a local detector, some smoke dampers are controlled 
automatically by a building’s smoke management system. Smoke dampers are designed to prohibit the 
passage of smoke and are classified for leakage in accordance with UL standard UL 555S, Standard for 
Safety Leakage Rated Dampers for Use in Smoke Control Systems. 
Smoke Management/Smoke Control—A means for minimizing smoke migration through a building due 
to a fire occurring within that building. 
Smoke Purging—A means for reducing the amount of smoke within a space in a building using 
mechanically supplied ventilation. Smoke purging generally involves introducing smoke-free supply air 
into the space and exhausting smoke-filled air from the space directly to the exterior of the building, with 
no re-circulation back into the building via the supply system.  Smoke purging can be used during the fire 
event to provide dilution of a smoke-filled environment in an effort to improve tenability or during post-
fire operations to remove smoke from the building once the fire has been extinguished. 
Tenability System—A smoke management system that as part of its basis for design anticipates occupant 
contact with smoke. Such a design considers various tenability criteria (i.e., smoke temperature, visibility, 
toxicity) to determine acceptable occupant exposure during egress.  A timed egress analysis is typically 
performed in conjunction with such a design. 
2.1.2 
Smoke Management Approaches 
The ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002) states that “smoke 
movement can be managed by use of one or more of the following mechanisms: compartmentation, 
dilution, air-flow, pressurization, or buoyancy.” National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 92A 
(NFPA 2000b) defines smoke control as the use of pressurization produced by mechanical fans. As stated 
by Klote and Milke, “by this definition, stairway pressurization, elevator pressurization, and zoned smoke 
control are all types of smoke control systems.” 
Compartmentation 
Compartmentation is a passive smoke control approach where smoke spread is minimized by the use of 
smoke barriers between defined areas of the building, typically referred to as smoke zones.  The leakage 
characteristics are defined so that the allowable openings contained in the barrier are small enough as to 
resist the passage of smoke.  Features such as firestopping of barrier penetrations, door 
gaskets/sweeps/drop seals, and stair/elevator vestibules are used to provide compartmentation.  Smoke 
dampers in HVAC ductwork and automatic door hold-open devices may also be used to provide 
compartmentation in the event of smoke detection in a given zone.

Exhaust Method 
The exhaust method of smoke control is an active smoke control approach that uses mechanical 
ventilation along with the buoyancy of the smoke to maintain smoke at a height 6 ft to 10 ft above the 
highest occupied floor of a large space such as an atrium. The buoyancy of the smoke causes it to rise to 
the upper levels of the space, which acts as a smoke reservoir to contain the descending smoke. The most 
commonly used approach is to provide mechanical smoke exhaust from the upper portions of the space, 
sized at a rate equal to the volumetric flow of the smoke entering the smoke layer to maintain the smoke 
layer above a design smoke layer interface. Figure 2–1 illustrates conceptually the exhaust method of 
smoke management (Mexhaust - mechanical exhaust rate; Mplume – mass flow rate of plume as it enters the 
smoke layer). 
 
Figure 2–1.  Exhaust method of smoke management. 
NFPA 92B (NFPA 2000c) describes the calculation methods associated with smoke management system 
design for large volume spaces such as atriums. The calculations described have been adopted in the 
atrium requirements included in the various model building codes adopted in the United States. 
NFPA 92B, while discussing the exhaust method of smoke control, also recognizes the use of natural 
ventilation to exhaust atrium-like spaces, a method not widely employed in the United States. NFPA 92B 
also discusses tenability approaches, recognizing that in some configurations, such as very large volume 
spaces, the amount of air being entrained into the fire plume dilutes the smoke to such an extent that the 
smoke in the descending layer presents little hazard to building occupants.

The exhaust method is not intended for use in low-ceiling spaces, as a smoke reservoir is needed to 
maintain the smoke above the level of building occupants. Sprinkler operation may also impact this 
approach for spaces with low ceiling heights, cooling the smoke so that it loses stratification and descends 
below the desired smoke layer interface. 
Pressurization Method 
For highly compartmented buildings with predominately low-ceiling spaces, such as high-rise office 
buildings (including open-plan office buildings, which are compartmented at the core and floor to floor), 
the pressurization method is an appropriate smoke management approach. The pressurization method 
involves use of mechanical ventilation systems to induce a pressure differential across a smoke barrier 
between the zone of fire origin and adjacent spaces, in order to contain the smoke to the zone of fire 
origin. 
The pressure differential required to achieve containment is a function of the smoke temperature within 
the zone of origin and the smoke layer height within the space, which impacts the buoyancy pressure of 
the layer. For unsprinklered buildings, the design pressure difference is generally 0.10 in. H2O (25 Pa), 
calculated based on an assumed gas temperature of 1,700 °F (925 °C) and a ceiling height of 9 ft. For 
sprinklered buildings, the design pressure is 0.05 in. H2O (12.5 Pa), including a 0.03 in. H2O safety factor. 
For zoned smoke management systems, the pressure difference is measured between the smoke zone and 
adjacent spaces while the affected areas are in the smoke-management mode (NFPA 2000b). It should be 
noted that because of the lower pressure differential required for sprinklered spaces, it is essential that 
sprinklers operate to ensure that the smoke management works properly. A system designed to 0.05 in. 
H2O will not create a sufficient pressure differential to hold back the high temperature smoke resulting 
from an unsprinklered fire. 
When designing a pressurization smoke management system it is important to not create excessive 
pressure differential to the extent that door overpressures may impede safe egress from a building. 
Depending on the size of the door and force applied by the door closer, maximum allowable pressure 
differentials typically range from 0.21 in H2O–0.45 in. H2O (52.2 Pa–112.0 Pa) and are designed to 
maintain maximum door opening forces below 30 lbf (133.4 N) (NFPA 2000b). However, some 
jurisdictions enforce maximum door opening forces as low as 15 lbf (66.7 N) (CBC 1998). 
There are two general types of pressurization smoke management systems: positive pressure systems, and 
negative pressure systems. These two types of systems are depicted in Figs. 2–2 and 2–3.

positive pressurization system should perform adequately to contain smoke, there are two drawbacks to 
using this type of system. First, excessive overpressures or imbalanced positive pressures may force 
smoke from the zone of fire origin into unintended areas of the building, thereby promoting smoke 
spread. Second, positive pressure systems do not result in the removal smoke from the building. 
Negative pressurization systems typically exhaust the zone of fire origin, either alone or in combination 
with supply in adjacent zones, to achieve the desired pressure differential. The simplest approach is to 
shut down ventilation in adjacent zones and exhaust the zone of fire origin. The benefit of this type of 
system is that smoke is directly removed from the building, improving conditions within the zone of fire 
origin and within the building as a whole. 
Stair pressurization is a type of positive pressurization smoke management system and is designed to limit 
smoke spread into the stairways of buildings such as a high-rise buildings. The intent of stairway 
pressurization systems is to maintain the primary egress paths of a building clear of smoke. Stairway 
pressurization, depicted in both Figs. 2–2 and 2–3, is required by the building codes currently enforced in 
the United States regardless of the smoke control approach selected in high-rise buildings. It is interesting

to note that in the various building codes enforced in the United States, stairway pressurization 
requirements are generally included in the section of the code containing the requirements for means of 
egress, and are not included in the section of the code pertaining to smoke control system design. 
For pressurization smoke management systems, system performance is often dependent on maintaining 
the integrity of the smoke barriers surrounding the zone to which smoke is to be contained. The applicable 
codes and standards generally contain requirements specifying maximum allowable smoke barrier 
leakage. While a looser system of barriers may be successful in providing the required performance, so 
long as fan capacity is increased to maintain the desired pressure differential, maintaining the integrity of 
smoke barriers is generally recommended as a basis of design. 
Airflow Method 
For large openings where the pressurization method is not applicable, it is possible to prevent smoke from 
migrating through the opening by means of an opposed airflow directed to limit smoke migration from 
the fire zone. In general, it is also preferable that the area of the opening be relatively small in relation to 
the plane in which it is contained. In addition, the airflow method is typically only used for openings that 
are in the vertical plane, such as doorways, hallways, etc. 
As shown in Fig. 2–4, if the airflow is not of sufficiently high velocity, or the temperature of the heated 
smoke is excessive, smoke backflow is still possible at the uppermost portion of the opening, resulting in 
two-way flow through the opening. The airflow method is generally more applicable to conditions where 
the smoke is diluted and of relatively low temperature. In addition, it is generally required that use of this 
method not result in excessive airflows toward a fire, so as not to unduly intensify the fire, disrupt plume 
dynamics, or interfere with exiting. This technique is not recommended in the ASHRAE text Principles of 
Smoke Management, “except when the fire is suppressed or, in the rare cases when fuel can be restricted 
with confidence” (Klote and Milke 2002). 
Dilution 
The term smoke purge, defined in Sec. 2.1.1, refers to the use of supply and exhaust ventilation to reduce 
the concentration of smoke within a space. Smoke purge is most often employed in post-fire cleanup 
operations; however, when this approach is used during a fire event, it is often referred to as dilution. 
System performance using dilution is often determined based on maintaining tenable smoke conditions. 
Tenability is a function of various criteria, including smoke temperature, toxicity, and visibility distance. 
Use of the dilution method to improve smoke conditions within a space containing a fire may be 
ineffective unless a fire is relatively small and the space in which it is contained is relatively large. Klote 
and Milke (2002) provide the following cautionary text regarding the use of dilution near a fire: 
There is no theoretical or experimental evidence that using a building’s 
HVAC system for smoke dilution will result in any significant 
improvement in tenable conditions within the fire space. It is well known 
that HVAC systems promote a considerable degree of air mixing within 
the spaces they serve. Because of this and the fact that very large 
quantities of smoke can be produced by building fires, it is generally 
believed that dilution of smoke by an HVAC system in the fire space will

not result in any practical improvement in the tenable conditions of that 
space. Thus it is recommended that smoke purging systems intended to 
improve hazard conditions within the fire space or in spaces connected to 
the fire space by large openings not be used. 
 
Figure 2–4.  Airflow method of smoke management. 
Use of the dilution method to improve smoke conditions remote from a fire may be effective, providing 
that the rate of smoke leakage is small compared to either the total volume of the protected space or the 
rate of air supplied to and removed from the space (smoke purge rate). 
2.1.3 
Factors Affecting Smoke Management 
The performance of a building’s smoke management systems can be impacted by a number of factors, 
including: stack effect, wind, air movement caused by the building’s HVAC systems, and temperature 
associated with the fire (i.e., buoyancy and expansion of hot combustion products).

Stack Effect 
Stack effect is a phenomenon which induces an upward or downward airflow within buildings due to the 
temperature difference between a building’s interior and the outdoors.  Generally, when the ambient air is 
colder than the building interior, air will move upward through the building.  This is sometimes referred 
to as normal stack effect and will occur under winter conditions.  When the ambient air temperature is 
warmer than the building temperature, air will move downward through the building.  This is referred to 
as reverse stack effect and will occur under summer conditions.  The magnitude of the stack effect 
induced airflow is directly dependent on the magnitude of the temperature differential between the 
building and ambient, as well as the building’s height.  Building airflows resulting from winter (normal) 
stack effect are depicted in Fig. 2–5. 
Because the magnitude of a stack effect is a function of temperature, stack effect is of greatest concern 
when the temperature differential between the inside of a building and outside the building is greatest. 
Except for extremely hot locales, such as Phoenix or Las Vegas, winter (normal) stack effect conditions 
are typically of greater concern than summer (reverse) stack effect conditions.  Winter stack effect is of 
greater concern for buildings located in New York City, due to the greater prevalence of colder outdoor 
air temperatures.

Climate data for the New York City area, measured at JFK International Airport were obtained from the 
ASHRAE Handbook (ASHRAE 2001). The extreme summer and winter conditions (corresponding to 
99 percent dry bulb temperatures) recommended by ASHRAE for use in the design of smoke 
management systems are as follows: 
Minimum design temperature (winter):  
15 °F (-9.4 °C) 
Maximum design temperature (summer): 
88 °F (31 °C) 
Stack effect has a greater impact for extremely tall buildings, as the magnitude of the stack effect is 
dependent on the temperature differential as well as the distance from the neutral plane. For World Trade 
Center (WTC) buildings 1 and 2, at the winter design temperature, stack effect pressures are on the order 
of 1.1 in. H2O (280 Pa) at the bottom and top of the building. Considering that these pressures are an 
order of magnitude higher than the design pressure for unsprinklered buildings, it is evident that stack 
effect can be a significant contributor to smoke spread in tall buildings. 
Wind 
The effect of wind on a building is a very complex phenomenon, which is affected by wind speed and 
direction, building shape, building height, and other nearby buildings. Wind pressures can vary widely 
across each face of a building, making input of wind pressure into computer simulations difficult. Wind is 
a transient phenomenon. The magnitude of the wind and its direction can fluctuate wildly. Therefore, 
many assumptions must be made in order to model wind in a smoke control analysis. In the absence of 
accurate wind pressure data from sources such as wind tunnel models or computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) programs, idealizations of wind pressure magnitudes must be made. For buildings that are 
rectangular in shape, average wind pressure coefficients have been calculated based on average values 
across a building face. 
Buildings that are exposed to the wind, without significant obstructions, experience a positive wind 
pressure on the wall facing the wind and negative wind pressures on the other three faces. The shape of 
the building as well as the wind velocity has an effect on the magnitude of the wind pressures on the 
various faces of the building. A simplified representation of wind-driven pressure differentials on WTC 1 
is depicted in Fig. 2–6. 
Figure 2–6 depicts a northerly wind impacting the building. On September 11, 2001, wind fluctuated out 
of the north/northwest at speeds between 5–15 mph, or an average of 10 mph. 
The ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook lists a design wind speed of 27 mph for the City of New York 
(JFK International Airport). This wind speed corresponds to the 1 percent extreme wind speed. The text 
accompanying this information indicates that this wind speed is used in the design of smoke management 
systems and that it is appropriate for this application (ASHRAE 2001). 
Wind generally acts to promote horizontal, rather than vertical air movement through a building, resulting 
in smoke spread from the windward side to the leeward side of a building. For buildings with relatively 
tight exterior walls, no operable exterior windows, and office spaces connected by a common HVAC 
plenum, wind effects tend to be minimal on smoke spread within the building. However, should windows 
be broken out (as may result from a fully involved fire on an office floor), or should other large openings

be created in the exterior walls of a building (as a result of an aircraft impact) wind can have a greater 
impact on smoke spread. Wind driven flows may help to force smoke into vertical shafts in the building 
(such as stairways or elevator hoistways), resulting in increased smoke spread to other floors due to 
buoyancy driven flows or stack effect. 
 
Figure 2–6.  Wind forces on WTC 1. 
HVAC Systems 
Building HVAC systems in addition to those dedicated for smoke control purposes, need to be evaluated 
for their contribution to smoke movement within a building. HVAC systems that are not shut down 
during a fire, or are set in a mode that re-circulates air through the building, may directly cause smoke 
spread through the building. 
HVAC ductwork systems are often equipped with duct smoke detectors that shut down the associated 
fans in an effort to limit smoke spread via the fan. However, the ductwork system may provide another 
conduit for smoke spread from floor-to-floor, particularly if the ductwork contains fire dampers rather 
than smoke dampers. Smoke temperatures may not be sufficient to cause closure of the dampers 
(particularly in sprinklered fire scenarios), resulting in the movement of smoke past the open fire damper 
and through the HVAC duct system. 
Temperature Effects 
For an unsprinklered fire, buoyancy of hot fire gases can be a significant contributor to smoke movement 
through a building. Smoke will form a layer in the upper part of the fire compartment and adjacent spaces, 
and spread vertically via shaft openings and other openings to floors above. For a sprinklered fire, the 
contribution of these buoyant forces to overall smoke movement in the building is reduced. Once the 
Chapter 2 
 
Draft for Public Comment

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
sprinkler is activated, the water spray will cool the hot gases. The momentum of the water spray will also 
stir the smoke layer, resulting in a more uniform smoke concentration within the room. 
The temperature of the fire gases for an unsprinklered fire may also affect smoke management system 
performance if the severity of the fire threatens the integrity of the smoke barriers (which are often 
required by code to have a fire resistance rating as well). As previously stated, maintenance of smoke 
barrier integrity is an important aspect of smoke management design. 
2.1.4 
Smoke Management System Reliability 
The reliability of an installed smoke management system is a function of a number of factors, including 
the relative simplicity of the system, and the frequency and type of testing performed on the system. The 
ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002) provides a brief discussion of 
system reliability, nothing that overall system reliability declines with increasing system complexity. This 
discussion recognizes, however, that the analysis provides only very rough estimates of reliability, due to 
the difficulty of obtaining data about the reliability of smoke management system components. 
A survey of the fire protection literature and discussions with persons knowledgeable in the area of smoke 
management system design conducted during the preparation of this report failed to identify any data on 
smoke management system component failure, nor did this inquiry identify any instances where operation 
of a smoke management system (successfully or unsuccessfully) during a fire could be adequately 
documented. 
In the absence of data to document smoke management system/component failure rates, it is necessary to 
perform testing to verify the proper operation of a smoke management system. In general, three types of 
testing are required to ensure proper system operation over the life of a building: 
1. Commissioning/Acceptance Testing 
2. Periodic Performance Testing 
3. Automatic Component Testing 
Commissioning/Acceptance Testing 
System commissioning, otherwise known as acceptance testing, is performed when the smoke control 
system is first installed in a building. This typically occurs when the building is being constructed, as 
building codes do not often require retroactive installation of smoke control in existing buildings. The 
purpose of this type of testing is to ensure that the system has been properly installed and that all 
sequences of operation perform as designed. In addition to verifying the proper installation and 
functionality of individual system components (i.e., fans, dampers, ductwork), automatic operation of 
system components and manual operation (typically via a fire fighter’s control panel) are verified. For 
pressurization smoke management systems, including stair pressurization systems, pressure differentials 
are verified to meet the design intent. 
It is important during commissioning that all related fire protection or building systems be tested to the 
extent that their operation impact the operation of the smoke management systems. Fire/smoke detection

devices and/or sprinkler water flow switches that initiate the smoke management system must be tested. 
In addition, the emergency/standby power systems must also be tested. Finally, the integrity of any 
barrier, partition, or floor assembly intended to resist smoke passage (smoke barrier) be either visually 
inspected or tested to verify that it will meet the design intent. 
Periodic Performance Testing 
Periodic performance testing is critical to ensure proper operation of a smoke management system over 
the life of a building. During a periodic test, all sequences of operation should be verified, and 
performance parameters such as pressure differentials should be re-measured as part of the test. It is 
possible that ongoing construction or maintenance work may have damaged a system component or in the 
case of a pressurization system, modified a smoke barrier in such a way as to affect its air leakage, which 
will impact the pressure differential capable of being achieved across that smoke barrier. 
NFPA 92A (2000b) and NFPA 92B (2000c) recommend annual or semi-annual periodic testing 
frequencies, depending on whether a smoke management system is a dedicated, or non-dedicated system. 
A dedicated system is one that is installed in the building solely to perform a smoke management function 
and is unused until called upon to perform in the event of a fire. Stair pressurization fans are typically 
dedicated system components. A non-dedicated system is one that uses components that are 
predominately used in the daily operation of the overall HVAC systems. The reliability of system 
components that are used frequently is expected to be much higher, due to the fact that any problem with 
system operation would likely be quickly corrected in order to ensure continued operation of the normal 
building HVAC systems. 
Up until the most recent editions of NFPA 92A and NFPA 92B (2000 editions), these documents existed 
as design guides. Therefore, the periodic testing frequencies are suggested practices, and are not written 
into any of the model building codes in the United States. While individual jurisdictions may require and 
enforce rigorous periodic testing, either at more frequent or less frequent intervals than those 
recommended by NFPA, some jurisdictions may require little or no periodic testing of smoke control 
systems. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that a majority of smoke control systems installed in high-
rise buildings may undergo limited or no periodic testing. 
Automatic Component Testing 
Automatic smoke management system component testing involves the periodic (usually weekly) self-
testing of individual system components (i.e., fans and dampers) by the fire alarm or smoke management 
panel that controls the system. The panel incorporates a time clock and a programmed sequence that 
exercises system components once per week and receives positive confirmation that the component 
operated properly. For fans, the self-test typically involves turning on the fan just long enough to receive 
positive confirmation of airflow via a pressure transducer, current transducer or sail switch. For dampers, 
the self-test typically involves cycling the damper into both the open and closed positions and receiving 
positive confirmation of each position via contact switches. The fire alarm or smoke control panel prints a 
report of each self-test and identifies components that failed to operate properly, and also generates a fault 
condition so that this failure may be identified by building personnel.

The automatic testing feature is a relatively new development, and is increasingly common in smoke 
management systems designed after 1998. This feature came into being primarily to address the issue of 
supervision of smoke management system components. Various building codes and standards required 
that system components be supervised, with typical language stated as follows: “Supervision shall include 
positive confirmation of actuation, testing, manual override, and the presence of power downstream of all 
disconnects.” 
The requirement to monitor power conductors for the presence of power downstream of all disconnects is 
somewhat problematic. The presence or absence of power to a fan will verify only that power is supplied 
to a fan. In the case of a fan that is normally OFF, such a monitor would show no power to the fan until 
the system is activated. The case where maintenance activities have resulted in the opening of a 
disconnect device in the circuit would not be detected or prevented by such a monitoring device, and 
hence, there is no improvement in system reliability by the installation of such a device. 
In the case of a fan that is normally ON, such a monitor would show the presence of power to the fan, and 
would alert building personnel to an instance where maintenance activities resulted in a fan being shut 
off. If a fan is normally operating, it is reasonable to assume that there is some reason for the airflow, and 
that occupants will notice the absence of that airflow in rather short order, initiating a service call. 
A device that monitors the presence of power cannot verify air movement, much less the proper quantity 
or direction of air movement. Underwriters Laboratories developed UL listing category UUKL–Smoke 
Control System Equipment in part to address this issue as well as other problems that exist with system 
supervision. 
The basic standard used by UL to investigate fire alarm/smoke control panels is UL 864, Control Units 
for Fire–Protective Signaling Systems. This standard does not cover the motors, fans, dampers, ducts, 
etc., which provide the HVAC function, and which are covered under their respective product categories. 
UL 864 does not investigate the safety of end-to-end supervision of power conductors. 
UL 864 was originally written, and is primarily used, as the governing standard for fire alarm system 
control units. The 9th Edition of UL 864, published in September, 2003, includes a section titled Smoke 
Control Service, which has been added to include the requirements for smoke control system equipment 
to obtain the UUKL listing. Prior to 2003, UL provided manufacturers of smoke control equipment with a 
letter of interpretation outlining the requirements for obtaining the UUKL listing. 
In drafting their standards (i.e., UL 864) for the listing of products to be used in complying with the 
various building and fire codes, UL considered all of the code language contained in the three model 
building codes. UL recognized that the traditional means to maintain the integrity of a system is electrical 
supervision of wiring and that the proper operation of the fans and dampers involves mechanical parts that 
may not be supervised by such electrical supervision. UL therefore considered end-process verification to 
be an acceptable alternative (Shudak 1998). 
UL 864 applies different testing criteria to HVAC systems based on their use.  For those systems that are 
dedicated entirely to smoke control function, UL requires the following: 
• 
Monitoring of the interconnecting wiring between the fire alarm control panel and the 
auxiliary relay controlling the motor control center for the fan 
Draft for Public Comment 
Background

19 
• 
End process verification of the operational status of each fan or damper 
• 
Automatic weekly activation of the smoke control system, with annunciation of the failure of 
any required function to operate 
The UL requirements to maintain the integrity of non-dedicated components (those components of the 
HVAC system within a building that are operated regularly) of the smoke control system are significantly 
less demanding. UL determined that the normal comfort level associated with the operability or non-
operability of the equipment is an acceptable means of maintaining system integrity for non-dedicated 
systems. Combined with the monitoring of the interconnecting wiring between the fire alarm control 
panel and the auxiliary relay controlling the motor control center for the fan, and end process verification 
of the operational status of each fan or damper during system operation, system reliability is maintained at 
an acceptable level. 
Prior to 1998, only a few of the major manufacturers of fire alarm system equipment had panels that 
carried the UUKL listing. Since that time, all of the major manufacturers have obtained UUKL listings on 
their products. While not currently codified in any of the major building codes, several jurisdictions, such 
as the City of San Francisco, now require, by way of local code amendments, the installation of UUKL 
smoke control panels in conjunction with smoke management system installation. 
In summary, the ability to perform automatic weekly self testing of smoke control system components has 
gone a long way toward improving the reliability of today’s smoke management systems. This technology 
is relatively new and is currently used in only a small proportion of the smoke management systems 
installed in high-rise buildings in the United States. 
2.2 
EVOLUTION OF SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CODE 
REQUIREMENTS 
In order to evaluate the adequacy of the smoke management systems installed in WTC 1, 2, and 7 at the 
time of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, it is not only important to understand the applicable 
code requirements for the buildings (discussed in Chapter 3), but also to develop an understanding of the 
timeframe in which various passive and active smoke-related code provisions came into being, both as 
concepts in the technical literature and as requirements in the major model building codes in the 
United States. This provides a reference as to what was considered state-of-the-art smoke management 
system design at various points over the life of the buildings. 
The fire protection literature was reviewed along with past editions of the Building Officials and Code 
Administrators (BOCA) National Building Code and the Uniform Building Code (UBC), as well as 
NFPA guides and standards. More recent developments in the International Building Code (IBC) and 
NFPA’s model building code (NFPA 5000) pertaining to smoke management systems were also 
considered. 
2.2.1 
Historical Milestones 
The origin of smoke management in buildings can be traced to an article that appeared in the NFPA 
Quarterly in 1939 titled Smoke Hazards of Air–Conditioning Systems (NBFU 1939). The article 
Chapter 2 
 
Draft for Public Comment 
20 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
summarizes a study performed by the National Board of Fire Underwriters (NBFU) and identifies the 
hazards associated with the spread of fire and smoke via HVAC system ductwork. 
The NBFU study states that in the event of fire occurring in an air-conditioned building, either inside or 
outside of the duct system or in the vicinity of air intakes, it is necessary to shut down the “blowers” so 
that the movement of air will not augment the fire, and interrupt the continuity of the duct system using 
dampers so that smoke, flame, and heat may not travel from their source to the places where damage may 
be caused. The current air-conditioning standard published by the NFPA, NFPA 90A contains 
requirements that are consistent with the findings of the NBFU study (Klote 1994). 
It is interesting to note that the NBFU study examines the use of smoke-tight dampers operated 
electrically or pneumatically based on smoke detection using photoelectric smoke detectors, a 
requirement that would not make its way into the building codes until a much later time. The study also 
states that “with some changes in design, an air-conditioning system could be arranged so as to reverse its 
flow at time of fire and eject smoke and products of combustion from the building.” However, the study 
further concluded that “very few systems could be so arranged except at a cost that would be prohibitive, 
and a further study of the matter casts grave doubts on the advisability of such an arrangement” 
(NBFU 1939). 
According to John Klote, co-author of the ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and 
Milke 2002), the major impact of the 1939 NBFU study was that for many years the approach for 
managing smoke was limited to shutting down the HVAC system. Combined with the then-prevailing 
higher emphasis on property damage over life safety, this practice led to the development of a fire damper 
standard well before a smoke damper standard (Klote 2004). 
The issue of smoke management in buildings did not gain further momentum until the late 
1960s/early1970s, right about the time that the WTC complex was being designed and built. The first 
edition of UL 555–Standard for Fire Dampers was published in 1968. ASHRAE also held a symposium 
covering fire hazards in buildings and air-handling systems at its annual meeting in 1968. A second 
ASHRAE symposium addressing these issues was held in 1970, followed by the International Conference 
on Firesafety in High-Rise Buildings in 1971. This conference was sponsored by the U.S. General 
Services Administration (GSA) (Klote 1994). 
The early 1970s saw several full-scale test programs that examined the effectiveness of smoke 
management systems (Klote 1995). In 1973, the Atlanta Building Department conducted tests in the 
Henry Grady Hotel to evaluate the effectiveness of stairway pressurization with and without stair 
vestibules, as well as elevator hoistway pressurization. Also during 1973, the Brooklyn Polytechnic 
Institute tested the effectiveness of stairway pressurization in a 22-story office building on Church Street 
in New York City. In 1976, an installed stair pressurization system in a new 7-story office building in 
Hamburg, Germany was tested by way of a full-scale fire test. In each of these test programs 
pressurization smoke management systems were shown to be effective in managing the spread of smoke 
created by full-scale unsprinklered test fires. 
In 1973, the ASHRAE handbook introduced a chapter titled Fire and Smoke Control, providing general 
information about fire protection, smoke production, smoke movement, and smoke control (Klote 1994). 
In subsequent years ASHRAE sponsored a series of seminars to educate design professionals on smoke 
management system design. In 1983, ASHRAE published a text titled Design of Smoke Control Systems 
Draft for Public Comment 
Background

21 
in Buildings (Klote and Fothergill 1983), which outlined the engineering principles pertaining to smoke 
management system design. This book was later updated as Design of Smoke Management Systems (Klote 
and Milke 1992). 
In 1983, the same year that ASHRAE published its design book, Underwriters Laboratories published the 
first edition of UL 555S–Leakage Rated Dampers for use in Smoke Control Systems. The 1985 edition of 
NFPA 90A–Installation of Air Conditioning and Ventilation Systems required that smoke dampers be 
installed in ducts which penetrate smoke barriers and that the smoke dampers satisfy the provisions of 
UL 555S. 
The NFPA formed its Technical Committee on Smoke Management Systems in 1985. This committee 
authored the first edition of NFPA 92A–Recommended Practice for Smoke-Control Systems, published in 
1988. NFPA 92A was intended to be used for systems designed based on the pressurization method of 
smoke control and brought together many of the previous developments in smoke management system 
design, referencing UL 555 for fire dampers, UL 555S for smoke dampers, and NFPA 90A for HVAC 
system design. The document also references the ASHRAE text Design of Smoke Control Systems in 
Buildings (Klote and Fothergill 1983) for further guidance on detailed design information. The committee 
went on to author the first edition of NFPA 92B–Guide for Smoke Management Systems in Malls, Atria, 
and Large Areas, published in 1991. 
In 1989, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a series of tests of zoned 
smoke control systems at the Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C. (Klote 1990). Fans were used to pressurize 
the stairway, exhaust the fire floor, and pressurize the floors above and below the fire floor. The 
experiments demonstrated that the smoke control system worked as intended (Klote 1995). The approach 
used in these tests would later become commonly referred to as “sandwich pressurization.” 
2.2.2 
Smoke Management in the Model Building Codes 
Past editions of the BOCA National Building Code and the UBC were reviewed back to 1968 in order to 
understand the evolution of smoke control system requirements in the model building codes. The year 
1968 was selected because (as discussed in Chapter 3 of this report), WTC 1 and WTC 2 were 
constructed under the provisions of the 1968 Building Code of New York City (BCNYC). The BOCA 
code was selected for comparison since this code covered the majority of the northeastern United States 
until approximately 1999. The UBC was selected since this code in recent years included the most 
stringent smoke control requirements of the major model building codes enforced in the United States. 
Prior to 1970, both BOCA and UBC required provision of stairways in high-rise buildings constructed as 
smokeproof enclosures that are naturally ventilated. This means that building occupants had to traverse an 
open air vestibule prior to entering a stairway, such that the stairway did not directly connect to the 
interior of the building. The 1970 edition of the UBC and 1971 supplement to the BOCA code specify the 
first requirements for mechanical ventilation options for smokeproof enclosures, requiring that vestibules 
be purged at a specified air change rate and stair shafts be pressurized to 0.05 in. H2O with all stair doors 
closed. At that time, both model codes only required that at least one of the required exits be a 
smokeproof enclosure. The chapter pertaining to exits was revised in the 1982 edition of the UBC, and 
required that all required high rise exits be smokeproof enclosures. The code did allow exemptions for 
enclosed stairways equipped with a minimum exhaust of 2,500 ft3/min and positive pressure maintenance

of 0.25 in. H2O with all stair doors closed.  The 1985 edition of the UBC added the requirement that a 
building be fully protected by an automatic sprinkler system in order to use this exemption. The UBC 
requirements for smokeproof enclosures remained essentially unchanged until they were eliminated in 
1992. BOCA made the change requiring all exits to be smokeproof enclosures starting in 1990. 
Both UBC (1973 edition) and BOCA (1978 edition) initially required fire dampers only in HVAC 
ductwork at shaft and fire barrier penetrations. The 1988 edition of the UBC first specified the 
requirement for approved smoke dampers, although no standard was actually referenced. The 1989 
supplement to the UBC referenced the newly created UBC Standard 43-12 for smoke dampers, which was 
based on UL 555S, Standard for Safety Leakage Rated Damages for Use in Smoke Control Systems. 
Smoke dampers were required wherever ducts penetrated smoke and draft barriers. The 1987 edition of 
the BOCA code first required approved smoke dampers wherever ducts penetrated a smoke barrier; 
however, no corresponding standard (i.e., UL 555S) was specified up to and including the 1999 edition of 
the BOCA code. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, smoke management system requirements varied from providing specified air 
change rates to exhaust smoke from a fire floor to providing break-out windows to vent smoke from the 
building. The 1973 edition of the UBC and the 1978 edition of the BOCA code required that high-rise 
office buildings have ventilation for the removal of smoke on every floor. Several methods of venting 
were allowed including using the HVAC equipment in fully-sprinklered buildings or mechanically 
venting the largest compartment served at a rate of 60 air changes per hour (this option was removed in 
1979), or using panels or windows in the exterior walls that were capable of venting smoke. If the HVAC 
equipment was used, this equipment was required to provide a minimum of one exhaust air change every 
10 min (6 air changes per hour) for the area involved. The 1982 edition of UBC included requirements for 
mechanical smoke removal from atria.  Four air changes per hour were required for an atrium volume less 
than 600,000 ft3 while 6 air changes per hour were required for atriums with greater volumes.  Local 
amendments to the code specified different smoke control approaches. For example, the 1992 edition of 
the San Francisco Building Code (SFBC) required that “systems be capable of exhausting 6 air changes 
per hour and supplying make-up air to the occupied space of any 2 adjacent floors, while simultaneously 
supplying outside air to (without return or exhaust from) the floors directly above and below the 
exhausted floors” (SFBC 1992). 
The 1992 supplement to the BOCA code removed the requirement for smoke control systems in high-rise 
buildings. Sec. 1019, Smoke Control Systems,was also rewritten to state that active smoke control is not 
required in atria where it can be demonstrated that the smoke interface level requirement can be met by 
passive means. The BOCA smoke interface level requirement was maintenance of the smoke layer above 
the highest unprotected opening or maintenance of a clear height of at least 6 ft above the highest floor of 
exit access open to the atrium. The most recent editions of the BOCA code, up to and including the 
1999 edition, did not require zoned smoke control in high-rise buildings. Stairways were required to be 
pressurized but did not have to be provided with vestibules. 
In 1994, a substantial revision was made to the smoke control requirements included in the UBC, 
resulting in UBC Sec. 905–Smoke Control. This code section represents the first code language based on 
the scientific and engineering principles included in NFPA 92A and NFPA 92B. The 1994 UBC specifies 
that a zoned smoke control system be provided for high-rise buildings, even though these buildings were 
now required to be fully sprinklered. In fact, the smoke control system design was predicated on the 
building being sprinklered in that the design pressure specified for sprinklered buildings was 0.05 in.

H2O. Stairways were required to have vestibules and be pressurized, but these requirements were included 
in the provisions of the code pertaining to means of egress. The 1994 UBC provisions remained 
unchanged in the 1997 edition of the code. 
In the late 1990s, a major restructuring occurred with regard to the model building codes in the 
United States. The BOCA code, UBC, and the Standard Building Code (widely used in the southeastern 
United States) combined to form the IBC, first published in 2000. At about the same time, the NFPA 
published its own building code, NFPA 5000, which was completed in 2002 and included in the 
2003 edition of the National Fire Codes. The 2000 and subsequent 2003 editions of IBC largely adopted 
the smoke management system design requirements contained in UBC Sec. 905. NFPA 5000, 
2003 edition, references NFPA 92A and NFPA 92B, which are currently being converted from design 
guides into standards. 
In both the 2000 and 2003 editions of the IBC and the 2003 edition of NFPA 5000, provision of a zoned 
smoke management system is no longer required for sprinklered high-rise buildings. The smoke 
management system provisions are only invoked for atriums and special occupancies such as correctional 
facilities. Stair pressurization systems are required by both the IBC and NFPA 5000 for high-rise 
buildings. 
During the draft review and comment process in the development of the IBC, at least five different 
proponents made proposals for the inclusion of a IBC Sec. 403.13, Smoke Control,requiring smoke 
control systems in high-rise buildings (ICC 1999). The main reason cited by the proponents was concern 
about smoke migration to upper levels of a building due to stack effect occurring in winter months. In 
each case the committee disapproved of the proposed change. Reasons for disapproval included a 
perceived low benefit versus a high cost in buildings that are sprinklered (which is required for high-rise 
buildings), as well as the lack of an adverse life loss history in high rise buildings and the resulting lack of 
data to substantiate the need for smoke control.

APPLICABLE CODES AND STANDARDS 
A study was performed as part of the analysis of building and fire codes of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) World Trade Center (WTC) Investigation to document the code 
requirements in the code of record under which WTC 1, 2, and 7 were built as well as the changes in 
building code regulations occurring subsequent to construction of the buildings that were enforced 
retroactively.  The results of this study are documented in the report, Fire Protection and Life Safety 
Provisions Applied to the Design and Construction of WTC 1, 2, and 7 and Post-Construction Provisions 
Applied after Occupancy (NIST NCSTAR 1-1D).  The summary of code requirements pertaining to 
smoke management systems contained in this chapter is paraphrased from NIST NCSTAR 1-1D. 
The WTC was constructed and maintained under the jurisdiction of the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port Authority).  While Port Authority facilities are not technically subject to 
the requirements of the local building codes, the PANYNJ voluntarily followed the New York City codes 
where applicable. In accordance with the instructions issued by the Port Authority at the start of the WTC 
project, WTC construction drawings were required to conform to the requirements of the Building Code 
of the City of New York (BCNYC). 
As stated in the Rolf Jensen & Associates report, WTC 1 and WTC 2 were constructed under the 1968 
edition of the BCNYC.  The 1968 BCNYC, including amendments to January 1, 1985, was used to 
provide the fire protection and life safety provisions during the design and construction phases (base 
building) of WTC 7. 
3.1 
BUILDING CODE OF NEW YORK CITY 
At the time of construction of WTC 1, 2, and 7, the majority of the northeast portion of the United States 
used building codes based on the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) national building 
code, with local amendments. New York City has developed a unique building code that references 
technical guidelines and installation requirements from a mixture of nationally recognized standards 
(National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], American Society for Testing and Materials, American 
National Standards Institute, etc.) as well as New York City developed reference standards. 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were designed according to the requirements of the 1968 BCNYC. In subsequent 
years, a number of local laws provided changes to fire protection and life safety provisions in the 
BCNYC. These local laws are as follows: 
• 
Local Law No. 5, Fire Safety Requirements and Controls (effective date immediately except 
as noted), January 18, 1973. 
• 
Local Law No. 16, Local Laws of the City of New York for the Year 1984 (effective date 
immediately except as noted), March 27, 1984.

Requirements and Controls in Certain Buildings (effective date immediately),

The BCNYC differs from other model building codes in one major respect. Changes to a building code 
generally affect only new buildings and are applied to an existing building only when a major renovation 
or change in occupancy occurs within the building. Many provisions contained within the local laws 
amending the BCNYC are applied retroactively; thus, these provisions are required to be implemented in 
existing buildings. 
All of the requirements included in the local laws listed above were in effect at the time of construction of 
WTC 7, since the local laws all predate the 1985 construction date of WTC 7. However, only some of the 
provisions are retroactively applicable to WTC 1 and WTC 2. These retroactive provisions are 
summarized in Sec. 3.2. 
3.2 
WTC 1 AND WTC 2 CODE REQUIREMENTS 
The following is a summary of the 1968 BCNYC provisions and post construction (retroactive) 
provisions that were in force at the time of construction of WTC 1 and WTC 2, as they pertain to smoke 
management systems and related requirements. 
3.2.1 
Compartmentation 
All new buildings classified in occupancy group E (business), and existing office buildings, 100 ft or 
more in height having air-conditioning and/or mechanical ventilation systems that serve more than the 
floor on which the equipment is located, unsprinklered floor areas, more than 40 ft above curb level, shall 
be subdivided by fire separations into spaces or compartments as required (C26-504.1, added by Local 
Law No. 5, Sec. 6). 
• 
All unsprinklered floor areas shall be segregated by 1 hour fire separations into spaces or 
compartments not to exceed 7,500 ft2. 
• 
Where the floor area exceeds 10,000 ft2, at least one of the subdividing fire separations shall 
be of 2 hour construction, creating areas of refuge.

• 
The floor area or any subdivided area may be increased to not more than 15,000 ft2 if 
complete area protection by approved devices for the detection of products of combustion 
other than heat is provided within such increased area and provided further that at least one of 
the subdividing fire separations shall be of 2 hour construction where the floor area exceeds 
15,000 ft2, creating areas of refuge as previously noted. 
• 
In existing buildings, existing 1 hour fire separations may be accepted in lieu of the 2 hour 
fire separation provided all of the requirements previously noted are complied with. 
• 
Compartmentation is not required when complete sprinkler protection is provided. 
• 
Existing office buildings 100 ft or more in height shall comply with the following 
requirements: 
− 
At least 1/3 of the total floor area of the building not in compliance with the requirements 
above on February 7, 1973, shall comply with the requirements above by December 13, 
1981. Complete plans showing such compliance shall be filed with, and a permit secured 
from the commissioner, by September 13, 1980 (Local Law No. 5, Sec. 6, dates revised 
by Local Law No. 86, Sec. 1). 
− 
At least 2/3 of the total floor area of the building not in compliance with the requirements 
above on February 7, 1973, must be in compliance on or before August 7, 1984 (Local 
Law No. 5, Sec. 6, dates revised by Local Law No. 86, Sec. 1). 
− 
Full compliance must be provided on or before February 7, 1988 (Local Law No. 5, 
Sec. 6, dates revised by Local Law No. 86, Sec. 1). 
• 
In existing office buildings 100 ft or more in height, the commissioner may waive or modify 
the above requirements and accept alternatives fulfilling the intent of the requirements if 
compliance would cause practical difficulty or undue hardship. Where compliance with the 
time requirements above would cause undue hardship, the commissioner, with the approval 
of the fire commissioner, may extend the time for compliance (Local Law No. 5, Sec. 6, 
revised by Local Law No. 86, Sec. 1). 
3.2.2 
Fire/Smoke Dampers 
Fire dampers are required in accordance with NFPA 90A (C26-504.5(a)) in the following locations: 
• 
Duct penetrations of walls with a 2 hour fire resistance rating or greater (Reference 
Standard 13-1 §902.a). 
• 
Each opening in required vertical shaft enclosures (Reference Standard 13-1 §902.b). 
• 
Each outlet or inlet opening in vertical shaft enclosure of duct systems serving two or more 
floors (Reference Standard 13-1 §902.c).

heat actuated device rated approximately 50 °F above the maximum system operating 
temperature (Reference Standard 13-1 §905.and §905.g). 
Duct openings permitted in fire resistance rated ceilings should be protected with fire dampers 
(C26-502.5(b)). Smoke dampers should be installed in the main supply duct and the main return duct in 
systems over 15,000 ft3/min capacity (Reference Standard 13-1 §1003). Smoke dampers should be 
arranged to close automatically when the system is not in operation, by the operation of duct smoke 
detectors, and by the manual emergency fan stop (Reference Standard 13-1 §1003). 
3.2.3 
Smoke and Heat Detectors 
Local Law No. 5 requires an approved smoke detecting device at the return shaft at each floor in order to 
monitor each inlet to the return air shaft. Activation of any of the detectors installed in the HVAC system 
shall stop the air supply to and the return from the affected floor. Airflow may be halted by the activation 
of an approved remote controlled reversible fire shutter or by automatically shutting down the air supply 
fans and the air return fans serving the floor where activated.

BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS 
The purpose of this chapter is not to provide an exhaustive description of the construction features and 
building systems comprising World Trade Center (WTC) 1, 2, and 7, but rather to provide pertinent 
details pertaining to building features that may have impacted smoke movement within the buildings or 
the design/function of smoke management systems. Building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning 
(HVAC) systems are described in somewhat greater detail in order to understand the capabilities of the 
HVAC systems to perform smoke management functions. 
4.1 
WTC 1 AND WTC 2 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The buildings were the first 
constructed as part of the seven-building WTC complex and were occupied by 1972. The buildings were 
110 stories above grade and seven levels below grade. WTC 1 (North Tower–Tower A) at 1,368 ft was 
slightly higher than WTC 2 (South Tower–Tower B) at 1,362 ft. Each building had a square floor plate 
measuring 207 ft 2 in. on a side. The buildings each had an approximate footprint area of 42,900 ft2. 
4.1.1 
Architectural Features 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were similar architecturally, with minor differences in layout. The interior of each 
floor differed due to the particular tenant build-out on that floor. In addition, the service core for the North 
Tower (WTC 1) was oriented east/west while the service core for the South Tower was oriented 
north/south. The service core gradually decreased in size on the upper floors of the building as the 
numbers of elevators contained on the floors decreased. 
The core spaces were separated from the perimeter spaces in the building by a 2 hour fire resistance rated 
barrier extending slab-to-slab. The cores contained the elevators, exit stairs, bathrooms, and 
miscellaneous equipment rooms. The perimeter office spaces were generally open-plan office spaces. 
Individual office spaces on the perimeter were generally separated by non-rated partitions extending only 
to the drop ceiling. The ventilation plenum above the drop ceiling was open around the perimeter of the 
floor. When the building was originally constructed, the perimeter office spaces were separated roughly 
into fourths by fire resistance rated partitions extending from the floor to the plenum ceiling. The fire-
rated compartmentation was required by the provisions of the Building Code of the City of New York 
(BCNYC) Local Law No. 5. When the building was retrofitted with automatic sprinklers, the fire resistive 
separations sub-dividing a floor were no longer required. Therefore, when floors were renovated, the 
separations were generally removed, and open plan layouts extending around the perimeter of a floor 
became more common. 
The towers were segmented roughly in thirds vertically by two mechanical equipment rooms (MERs) 
encompassing the entire 41st floor and 75th floor, in addition to the MERs at the top (108th floor) and 
bottom (7th floor) of the buildings. The aircrafts that crashed into WTC 1 and WTC 2 impacted the upper 
third of each building, between the 75th floor MER and 108th floor MER.

The floor layouts for representative floors in WTC 1 and WTC 2 are depicted in Figs. 4–1 and 4–2, 
respectively. The floors depicted are typical of the primary aircraft impact floor in each building, the 95th 
floor in WTC 1 and the 80th floor in WTC 2. Figs. 4–1 and 4–2 show the differences in orientation of the 
service core, locations of electrical risers, and shaft types and location. 
 
Figure 4–1.  Floor layout, 95th floor, WTC 1. 
During tenant renovations, tenants occupying multiple floors often added additional convenience stairs 
connecting multiple levels. The stairs were most often open to two levels, interrupted by a rated partition 
and stair door at every other level. As an example, Marsh & McLennan was a building tenant occupying 
the 93rd through 100th floors of WTC 1 (also the zone of aircraft impact for this building). Up to three 
convenience stairs were provided on the Marsh & McLennan floors, open at every other level. Figure 4–1 
depicts the two convenience stairs on the 95th floor; one happens to be open at that floor, the other has a 
rated partition with a door.

It is well-documented that vertical shafts are the primary conduit for smoke spread in high-rise buildings. 
It has been estimated that in a high-rise building up to 65 percent of the vertical airflow (and thus, smoke 
spread) is via the stair and elevator shafts, while the remaining 35 percent is via the other vertical shafts in 
the building (Tamura and Shaw 1976). Figure 4–3 depicts the stairs and elevator shafts in the building.

As seen in Fig. 4–3, each tower was provided with three emergency exit stairways, enclosed in 2 hour 
rated gypsum wallboard construction. The plan location of the stairways shifted at some levels, with 
occupants required to move from one stairway segment to another via a horizontal transfer corridor, 
separated from the stair shafts by fire rated doors. Stairs 1 and 2 had transfers at the 42nd, 48th, 76th, and 
82nd level. Stair 1 had an additional transfer on the 26th floor. Stair 3 had only a single transfer, at the 
76th floor. Stairs 1 and 2 were located more on the perimeter of the core, while Stair 3 was located more 
toward the center of the core. Figures 4–1 and 4–2 show the different stair locations on the 80th and 95th 
floors of the buildings. 
Figure 4–3 also shows the locations of the ninety-nine elevator shafts in each building. In order to 
facilitate movement of the thousands of office workers who regularly worked in the towers to the upper 
office floors in the building, a system of express and local elevators was installed in each building. 
High-speed express elevators shuttled people from the lobby to sky lobbies on the 44th floor and 
78th floor of each building. Escalators connected the sky lobbies to the floors immediately above and 
below. 
Local elevators provided access from the sky lobby floors to the upper floors of the buildings. Freight 
elevators 49 and 50 extended to different heights in the buildings, with freight elevator 50 extending the 
full height of each building. 
4.1.2 
HVAC Systems 
Building ventilation (heating and cooling) was provided in WTC 1 and WTC 2 by HVAC systems located 
in four MERs located on the 7th, 41st, 75th, and 108th floors of each building. The building HVAC 
systems for WTC 1 and WTC 2 are described in detail in Operation & Maintenance Manual #15–HVAC 
System, Towers A & B (PANYNJ 1987) and are summarized in the paragraphs that follow. 
The buildings were effectively broken up into four vertical HVAC zones, as shown in Fig. 4–4. Each 
MER was approximately two stories tall and had an upper and lower level. With the exception of the 
108th floor MER, which was located at the top of the building above the floors that it served, the 
MERs served the floors immediately above and below the floor on which they were located. As seen in 
Fig. 4–4, the WTC 1 aircraft impact occurred in the uppermost portion of the building (92nd through 
98th floors), served from above by the 108th floor MER. The WTC 2 aircraft impact occurred slightly 
lower in the building (77th through 84th floors), on floors served from below by the 75th floor MER. 
HVAC supply fans were located on the lower level of each MER. Supply air was provided to the building 
via core, interior, and perimeter HVAC units. As shown in Fig. 4–5, there were two core supply 
ventilation zones (north/south in WTC 2, east/west in WTC 1, due to the orientation of the core), four 
interior space HVAC zones (corresponding to the four quadrants of the building), and four perimeter 
zones (north/south/east/west). The core and interior units provided low pressure air that was conditioned 
at each unit in the MER. Perimeter supply air was provided by high pressure fans and was conditioned at 
induction units located around the perimeter of the building on each floor.

Figure 4–6 shows the location of the various supply HVAC units on the lower level of the 75th floor 
MER in WTC 2. This MER was selected since it served both floors above and below the MER, and was 
also the MER serving the floors of impact in WTC 2. For WTC 2, the primary HVAC shafts were located 
at the east and west sides of the core. The supply fans were also located on the east/west sides of the floor 
and used air drawn from supply plenums running along both the east and west sides of the MER. It can be 
seen that there were two HVAC units that served the core spaces. One unit provided supply air to the 
north core zone on all floors served by the MER, with the other unit supplying the south core zones. 
Ductwork ran from the fans to several shafts within the core. These shafts ran both upward and downward 
to the floors served.

Figure 4–6.  Schematic, supply HVAC units, lower level 75th floor MER, WTC 2. 
Interior space supply air was provided by eight large HVAC units. Four groups of two fans each were 
located in each quadrant of the MER. One fan in each group served the floors above the MER, while the 
other unit served the floors below the MER. The fan location corresponds to the location of the interior 
zones served. For example, the fans located in the northeast corner of the MER served the interior zones 
in the northeast quadrant interior ventilation zone. 
The four high pressure perimeter zone fans each served either the north, south, east, or west zones. It can 
be seen (Fig. 4–6) that two runs of high pressure circular ductwork branched out from each fan and were 
routed to the same shaft. One high pressure duct extended upward to the floors above the MER, and the 
other dropped down to the floors below. In contrast to the high pressure ductwork, the low pressure 
ductwork used by the core and interior HVAC units was generally rectangular in shape. 
The high pressure supply ductwork supplied air from the perimeter HVAC units in the MERs to induction 
units located around the perimeter of floor. The induction units stood roughly 18 in. high and were 
located in front of the windows at the perimeter of the office space. High pressure air was discharged 
through nozzles in each induction unit across a coil, with the air being heated or cooled depending on the 
temperature of the water flowing through the coil. The function of the induction units was to offset the

high heating/cooling loads at the perimeter of the building and to induce circulation of the room air in 
combination with the overhead interior supply registers. 
Figure 4–7 shows a simplified representation of the air distribution systems as originally designed for a 
typical tenant floor, in this case the 80th floor in WTC 2. As previously stated, low pressure supply air 
was ducted to air inlets in the four perimeter HVAC zones in the four quadrants of the building.  Air inlets 
were generally slot diffusers integrated in the overhead light fixtures.  All HVAC ductwork ran in the 
return plenum above each floor.  It should be noted, however, that the high pressure perimeter zone 
ductwork actually served the floor above, entering the perimeter induction units from the plenum below 
the floor served. Fire dampers were provided at the exhaust air inlets into the return shafts and within the 
supply ductwork at the shaft walls, as depicted in Fig. 4–7.  Smoke detectors were also provided at the 
exhaust air inlets to facilitate shutdown of the HVAC systems in the event of a fire.

Return HVAC fans were located on the upper level of each MER.  Figure 4–8 depicts the return fan 
locations on the 75th floor MER in WTC 2. Four sets of return air shafts were located along the east and 
west sides of the core, returning air from the interior HVAC zones at the four quadrants of each floor. 
Whereas supply ventilation was provided by a ducted supply system utilizing metal ductwork, the return 
ventilation was provided by way of gypsum wallboard return shafts.  Air was drawn through return grilles 
on each floor into a return plenum above the occupied spaces on each floor.  Return air was then drawn to 
the MER exhaust fans via the gypsum wallboard shafts.

The return fans discharged air from the return shafts into spill plenums on the east and west sides of the 
MER. Two sets of dampers were located within the spill plenum: 
1. Return dampers 
2. Exhaust dampers 
The return dampers, located in the floor of the spill plenum, allowed air to be re-circulated to the supply 
air fans. Alternately, air could be discharged directly to the exterior of the building. The amount of air 
exhausted/recirculated was a function of the outside air temperature. More air was recirculated under 
extreme hot and cold outside air conditions to reduce the cooling/heating load on the HVAC systems and 
reduce the cost of space conditioning. 
Air was returned from the core spaces via small fans located on the north and south sides of the MER 
(shown in Fig. 4–8).  Exhaust air fans for the core provided toilet exhaust and elevator machine room 
(EMR) exhaust.  Because of the nature of these exhaust streams no exhaust air was recirculated from the 
core back into the building. 
The air distribution system configuration described above was the base building design at the time that 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were constructed.  While the air distribution systems remained as designed on some 
floors of the building (with little to no modification), these systems may have been substantially modified 
on other floors of the buildings, based on the needs of the tenants and the design standards being used at 
the time of tenant retrofits. 
An example of such modifications is the HVAC systems serving the Marsh & McLennan offices on the 
93rd through 100th floors of WTC 1.  The lower floors of this office space were also the aircraft impact 
floors in WTC 1.  The Marsh & McLennan floors were retrofit in the years just preceding September 11, 
2001.  Therefore, the HVAC systems were relatively new in this area of the building. Figure 4–9 shows a 
simplified representation of the air distribution system on the 95th floor of WTC 1. 
The Marsh & McLennan HVAC systems utilized the base building supply air for the interior HVAC 
zones. New ductwork connected to the base building HVAC ductwork at the major supply air shafts and 
connections remained from the return plenum to return air shafts. However, perimeter heating and cooling 
was provided using small fan coil units (FCUs) located around the perimeter of the return air plenum, as 
most of the perimeter induction units were removed from the Marsh & McLennan floors. The FCUs were 
designed to draw air in from the plenum, heat or cool the air as necessary as it passed through the coil, 
and then distribute the air via a small number (2-4) of supply air diffusers ducted to each FCU. 
As seen in Fig. 4–9, several re-circulating air handling units (AHUs) were installed on the 95th floor to 
provide additional HVAC capacity for a computer room located on that floor. These AHUs re-circulated 
air within the computer room.

Figure 4–9.  Air distribution system, 95th floor, WTC 1. 
Supply air provided by the high pressure ductwork outlets on each floor was sometimes used to supply 
other HVAC systems. For instance, a small AHU was located on the 99th floor of WTC 1 to provide 
additional heating/cooling to a conference center located on that floor. This AHU received supply air by 
connecting to one of the four high pressure HVAC ducts serving the floor. 
By examining modifications to the Marsh & McLennan HVAC systems, it can be seen that the HVAC 
configuration for each floor of WTC 1 and WTC 2 had the potential to vary, creating unique layouts for 
many floors of the building. However, these changes were not likely to have an effect on smoke 
management system performance since the changes impacted the use of the high pressure perimeter air as 
well as the patterns in which air was distributed within a given floor. As will be discussed in Chapter 6 of 
this report, the smoke management systems for WTC 1 and WTC 2 utilized only the interior air systems 
and core systems, which were not modified substantially as a result of tenant retrofits. Perimeter air was 
not used for smoke management.  Further, the plenum return arrangement and total air quantities 
remained unchanged, despite individual tenant retrofit configurations. While smoke movement may have 
been impacted on a given floor, overall pressure differentials would be expected to remain the same.

Electrical Systems 
Electrical power for the building was provided via two separate feeds from a Consolidated Edison 
(Con Ed) substation located on the lower floors of WTC 7. An additional power feed was provided 
subsequent to the 1993 bombing via the Port Authority Trans-Hudson train tunnel from New Jersey. 
Emergency generators and fuel tanks located on the B6 level of the complex just to the southwest of 
WTC 1 provided emergency power to all emergency systems (emergency lighting, fire alarm system and 
fire pumps) and the elevators in the building. 
Three electrical risers were located in each building. The electrical closets/risers were designated “north,” 
“central,” and “south” in WTC 1. The risers were designated “east,” “central,” and “west” in WTC 2. The 
location of the electrical closets on each floor are depicted in Figs. 4–1 and 4–2. Electrical substations 
were provided on each MER level. 
4.2 
WTC 7 
WTC 7 was completed in 1987 and was located to the north of the WTC complex on the opposite side of 
Vesey Street. The building was 47 stories above-grade and had a height of 618 ft. WTC 7 had a footprint 
area of approximately 40,000 ft2 and was designated Type I-C construction. 
WTC 7 was built over an existing Con Ed substation and a shipping ramp that served the entire WTC 
complex. The lower six floors of the building contained the substation, electrical switchgear, emergency 
generators, transformers, and fuel storage tanks. Floors 3 and 4 also contained a conference center for 
Salomon Smith Barney (SSB), the tenant occupying the largest portion of the building. Floors 7 through 
25 housed multiple tenants, with most occupying a single floor. Floors 7 and 8, 11 to 13, 19 to 21, and 
26 to 27 were occupied by multi-floor tenants. SSB occupied floors 28 through 45. 
WTC 7 collapsed on September 11, 2001, at 5:20 p.m. National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) is investigating the cause of failure of WTC 7 and hypotheses regarding the collapse of this 
building are discussed in NIST NCSTAR 1-6E. 
4.2.1 
Architectural Features 
Figure 4–10 depicts the floor layout for a typical floor in WTC 7. The service core for the building was 
located in the east-west direction, and contained the elevators, exit stairs, bathrooms, and 
mechanical/electrical equipment rooms. The perimeter spaces were generally either open-plan office 
spaces or hard-walled individual office spaces. Individual office spaces were generally separated by non-
rated partitions extending only to the drop ceiling. The ventilation plenum above the drop ceiling was 
open around the perimeter of the floor. The building was protected throughout by automatic sprinklers 
with the exception of certain equipment rooms on the lower floors of the building. 
The building was served by low-rise (floors 7 through 20), mid-rise (floors 21 through 37), and high-rise 
(floors 38 through 45) elevators, as well as service and freight elevators that ran the entire height of the 
building. There were a total of 31 elevators serving the building. The locations of high-rise and mid-rise 
elevators and freight/service elevators are shown in Fig. 4–10.

Figure 4–10.  Floor layout, 24th floor, WTC 7. 
Two exit stairs served the building and were referred to as Stair 1 (or Stair A) and Stair 2 (or Stair B). The 
position of Stair 1 remained constant on each floor of the building. The position of Stair 2 shifted at the 
23rd floor, due to the location of the low-rise elevators serving the lower floors. Below the 23rd floor 
Stair 2 was located approximately where the electrical closet is shown, to the east of its location in  
Fig. 4–10. 
The individual floors of the original building layout were served by HVAC equipment located in a fan 
room on each floor. This is in contrast to WTC 1 and WTC 2, which had dedicated MER floors that 
served multiple floors of the buildings, as shown in Fig. 4–4. 
During the early 1990s, SSB performed a major tenant retrofit to floors 28 through 45. The retrofit 
included the combining of adjacent floors into single floors, the relocation of HVAC shafts, and the 
provision of new HVAC equipment to supplement base building equipment. Two two-story trading floors 
were created by combining the 40th/41st and 42nd/43rd floors. The trading floors each had a raised floor 
that served as a return plenum. HVAC fans and electrical/data services were located beneath the raised 
floors. 
In addition to the trading floors, various SSB floors were retrofit with technology spaces housing 
computer equipment. A large auditorium was included in the northwest corner of the building, spanning 
the 38th/39th floors. Cafeteria spaces with kitchens were also located within the building.

4.2.2 
HVAC Systems 
Building ventilation (heating and cooling) was provided on the tenant floors (floors 7 through 47) for the 
base building configuration in WTC 7 by variable air volume (VAV) AHUs located on each floor. The 
building HVAC systems for WTC 7 are described in the WTC 7 Operations Manual (PANYNJ 1988). 
Each floor in WTC 7 was served by an AHU located in the fan room on that floor that consisted of two 
fans feeding into a common supply plenum. Conditioned air was then distributed to the floor in two 
zones, corresponding to the north/east, and south/west portions of the building. The fan room served as a 
return plenum. Return air was drawn into the fan room via three branch ducts leading from the fan room. 
Make-up air was drawn into the fan room via make-up air shafts that connected to the exterior of the 
building either at the roof or at the 6th floor via louvers. The base building HVAC configuration for 
WTC 7 is depicted in Fig. 4–11. 
 
Figure 4–11.  Air distribution system, 24th floor, WTC 7. 
The WTC 7 HVAC systems were designed to incorporate a smoke purge mode, by which each floor of 
the building could be exhausted/purged of smoke manually on a floor-by-floor basis from the fire 
command center, which was located on the 3rd floor of the building at the main lobby security desk 
(PANYNJ 1988). 
Two smoke exhaust fans, each having a capacity of 36,000 ft3/min (61,164 m3/h) were originally located 
at two locations within the building. Exhaust fan SX-5-1 was located on the 6th floor and served floors 7 
through 23. Exhaust fan SX-47-1 was located on the 47th floor and served floors 24 through 47. As 
shown in Fig. 4–11, the smoke exhaust duct was located near Stair 2 within the fan room. The return air

ductwork was connected to the exhaust duct. Return air either dumped into the fan room via the return 
dampers in each branch duct or was exhausted via the smoke exhaust riser. A smoke exhaust damper 
opened at the shafts and the return dampers closed to exhaust smoke in the smoke purge mode. 
Curtain fire dampers were located throughout the building where ductwork crossed fire rated shaft walls. 
Separate pneumatic smoke dampers were used in the fan room to direct airflow within HVAC ductwork. 
Major changes/additions to the building HVAC systems were made during the SSB tenant retrofit.  AHUs 
were added to handle the increased air conditioning loads created by the extensive computer and data 
processing equipment. Existing building systems were modified to add an increased make-up air capacity. 
A new, larger, make-up air shaft was added near the existing smoke shaft in the vicinity of Stair 2. The 
shaft was relocated to create more usable space by allowing the removal of the original fan room on the 
trading floors and other select floors.  A transfer fan and ductwork were added to provide outside air to 
the existing outside air shaft in its original location below the 24th floor. 
In order to bring additional make-up air into the building, a large make-up AHU was installed in a new 
rooftop mechanical penthouse.  This provided forced ventilation make-up air rather than the open shaft 
configuration present in the original building.  Additional AHUs and exhaust fans were also located in the 
penthouse. 
A new smoke exhaust fan was added to replace the existing SX-37-1 smoke purge fan.  The new, larger, 
fan had a capacity of 84,000 ft3/min (142,000 m3/h).  An additional smoke purge fan (SX-47-2) was also 
installed, to provide smoke exhaust from the 45th through 47th floors of the building.  Dedicated smoke 
exhaust fans were also provided for the trading room floors (SX-40-1, SX-41-1, SX-42-1, SX-43-1).  
Each of these fans had a capacity of 15,560 ft3/min (26,452 m3/h). 
Several new fan rooms were added to house the additional AHUs. A fan room was added at the midpoint 
of the west wall of WTC 7 on the SSB floors. A louvered opening was provided to the exterior of the 
building from each fan room along the west wall. Various types of HVAC equipment were located within 
these fan rooms, including kitchen exhaust fans serving the cafeteria spaces on the 34th and 41st floors. 
New fan rooms were also added to serve the two-story trading floors. The new fan rooms were located 
along the east wall of WTC 7, on the upper level of the trading floors (referred to as the mechanical 
mezzanine level). Fans within the east fan rooms returned air via ductwork from beneath the raised 
trading room floor, re-conditioned the air, and then supplied air at the upper level of the two-story space. 
Small FCUs were located beneath the raised floor to draw return air through the trading desks back into 
the raised-floor return plenum. 
In several locations throughout the SSB floors, individual FCUs were provided within the return plenums 
to recirculate and condition air within the perimeter spaces of the building. Free standing Leibert units 
(recirculating HVAC systems) were also provided within technology spaces/computer rooms to provide 
local air conditioning within these spaces. 
The SSB tenant modifications incorporated combination fire/smoke dampers at many locations within the 
HVAC ductwork to provide fire separation and to direct airflow within HVAC ductwork.

Electrical Systems 
Electrical power for WTC 7 was provided from the Con Edison substation on the lower floors of the 
building and stepped down by transformers on the 5th floor of the building to be distributed throughout 
the building. Within electrical substations on each floor, one of the 277 V legs was stepped down to 
supply 120 V branch circuits. Emergency power generators were located on various levels of the building 
and supplied backup power for communications equipment, elevators, emergency lighting in corridors 
and stairways, and fire pumps. Individual backup batteries were provided for emergency lighting units 
located in exit stairways, elevator lobbies, and elevator cabs (McAllister 2002).

RELEVANT HISTORY—PAST STUDIES AND FIRE-RELATED EVENTS 
Two major fire-related events in the history of the World Trade Center (WTC) complex had an impact on 
decisions that affected the spread of fire and smoke within WTC 1 and WTC 2 in the event of a fire and 
had the potential to impact the smoke management systems installed in the towers. The first incident 
involved a major fire that occurred on the 11th floor of WTC 1 on February 14, 1975. The second 
incident involved a car bomb that exploded in the WTC complex parking garage on February 26, 1993, 
resulting in smoke spread throughout the towers. The following sections provide a summary of these two 
events and discuss changes to the buildings that were made subsequent to each event that impacted smoke 
movement and control. Two engineering studies performed subsequent to the 1993 bombing that 
recommended changes to the smoke management system design for the towers are also discussed in this 
chapter, as well as a study of an early prototype stair pressurization system. 
5.1 
WTC 1 FIRE—FEBRUARY 13, 1975 
On February 13, 1975, a fire occurred in WTC 1 (Powers 1975; Lathrop 1975). The fire was reported by a 
worker in the building at approximately 11:35 p.m., who noticed flames under the door leading to the 
office suite occupying roughly the entire southeast quadrant of the 11th floor of the building. It was later 
estimated that the fire originated in an executive office in this area from an unknown source at 
approximately 11:30 p.m. 
The worker reported the fire to the WTC police headquarters. According to the New York Bureau of Fire 
Underwriters (NYBFU) report (Powers 1975), the police put into effect the planned fire procedure. The 
city fire department was called, three policemen responded to the fire floor with a fire equipment cart 
(typically stationed in the 44th and 78th floor sky lobbies of each tower), and the building engineer was 
advised to be prepared to put the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in the “purge” 
mode. When police reached the fire floor, they reported a serious fire, and the HVAC system was placed 
in the purge mode. 
Subsequent to the start of the firefighting efforts, a search of the building disclosed that fire had spread to 
the telephone closets on the 9th through the 19th floors, via a 12 in. by 18 in. unprotected cable opening 
in the floors closets. These fires were reportedly readily extinguished, and they did not spread from the 
telephone closets. 
At the time of the fire, each floor of the building was subdivided into quadrants via fire barriers, which 
contained the fire to the southeast quadrant of the building, which was consistent with the requirements of 
New York City Local Law No. 5.  The fire involved roughly 9,000 ft2 of the 11th floor, destroying about 
half the contents and damaging the remainder of the contents in this area (Powers 1975).  The fire barriers 
did not extend into the return plenum above the office space on each floor.  Therefore, the return plenum 
was open around the perimeter of the building.

The fusible link on the fire shutter at the southeast quadrant exhaust shaft operated and closed down the 
exhaust inlet sometime after the fire gained in intensity.  However, hot smoke migrated around the 
perimeter of the floor within the open return plenum and was exhausted via the exhaust risers serving the 
other three quadrants of the building.  High temperatures in the plenum reportedly (Powers 1975) radiated 
enough heat into the offices in the uninvolved quadrants on the 11th floor to melt plastic phones and char 
papers on desk tops, but ignition did not occur outside the area of fire origin. The fire was eventually 
extinguished by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). 
5.1.1 
Post-Event Building Modifications—1975 Fire 
The primary enhancement to WTC 1 and WTC 2 following the 1975 fire that impacted the issues of 
smoke movement and smoke management in the buildings was an improvement with regard to unsealed 
vertical penetrations. The fire illustrated the ability of fire and smoke to spread vertically in high-rise 
buildings via unprotected vertical openings. As a direct result of the fire, the floor openings were fire-
stopped with vermiculite concrete poured into forms around the cables in the telephone closets. The 
louvers in the doors to the closets were sealed with steel plates. 
5.1.2 
Important Considerations—1975 Fire 
There are several items identified in the Powers and Lathrop accounts of the 1975 fire that potentially 
relate to the understanding of the installed smoke management systems and their potential function on 
September 11, 2001. 
Both Powers and Lathrop describe the use of the WTC 1 smoke purge sequence as an active fire 
protection measure used to improve conditions during the 1975 fire, as opposed to using the HVAC 
system purge as part of post-fire cleanup efforts. With regard to the function of the purge mode, Powers 
(1975) states that “this means that outdoor air was being blown into the core area to keep it free of smoke 
and air was being drawn out of all the tenant areas on this floor to prevent smoke from spreading 
throughout the building.”  He also states that “in the case of fire, the supply air fans for the air 
conditioning section are shut down and only the return air fans operate and discharge to the outside of the 
building… The other part of this protection is achieved by supplying outdoor air to the core and shutting 
down its normal vents. This pressurizes the elevators as well as the stairs and keeps the exit corridors free 
of smoke.”  Lathrop (1975) also documents that during a fire, office areas could be put on 100 percent 
exhaust, with the core getting 100 percent supply, accomplished in 32 floor segments corresponding to a 
single HVAC zone. As will be discussed in Chapter 6 of this report, this differs from the sequence of 
operations listed in the building operations manuals with regard to the smoke purge sequence. 
The NYBFU report (Powers 1975) recognized that when a fire shutter closes, the ability of that exhaust 
shaft to exhaust smoke is “nullified.” The report recommended that in unsprinklered buildings, detectors 
be provided at the return air shafts on each floor to cause them to discharge the return air and stop the 
delivery of outdoor air to the fire area. 
The Lathrop account of the 1975 fire implied that the smoke purge system cleared smoke from all floors 
except the fire floor. This is significant since the building was unsprinklered at the time of the fire and the 
fire was substantial in nature, involving over 9,000 ft2 of office space.  Yet, fire/smoke spread to other 
floors was minor and was due primarily to unprotected openings in the telephone closets.

It is significant to note that since the fire occurred in February, and at a time when the building HVAC 
systems were largely shut down, stack effect would have been expected to have been substantial at the 
time of the fire. Since the floor of fire origin was low in the building (11th floor), stack effect flows would 
cause air to flow inward toward the building’s core then upward via stair/elevator shafts and open HVAC 
ducting. Yet, little smoke spread to other floors was noted. The degree of passive compartmentation 
present in the building at the time of the fire, coupled with the operation of smoke exhaust from the zone 
of fire origin appears to have been effective in minimizing the smoke movement that would have occurred 
due to stack effect. 
5.2 
WTC BOMBING—FEBRUARY 26, 1993 
At 12:18 p.m. on February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in a parking garage located in the sub-levels of the 
WTC complex (Isner and Klem 1993). The task force that investigated the bombing concluded that the 
explosion and subsequent fire were caused by the detonation of at least 1,000 lb of explosives located in a 
van parked on the B2 level of the complex, in an area of the garage adjacent to WTC 1 and under WTC 3 
(then referred to as the Vista Hotel). The explosion created a crater involving six levels of the 
underground portion of the complex. The uppermost portion of this large open space connected to the 
lobby of the Vista Hotel via an 18 ft by 22 ft hole in the lobby’s floor slab. The blast also created a large 
hole in the glass wall separating the hotel lobby from the lobby of WTC 1. 
The explosion damaged four of seven operating electrical feeders (an eighth was undergoing maintenance 
at the time of the bombing), causing short circuits in the system. This resulted in loss of normal electrical 
power to most areas of WTC 1 and WTC 2. Normal lighting systems and the building HVAC systems 
shut down. Emergency generators operated for approximately 20 min before overheating, causing 
automatic shutdown of the diesel engines. The lighting system in the stairways of both towers operated 
for approximately 1 hour and 15 min. while the emergency lighting systems were being powered by the 
normal or emergency electrical system. However, normal electrical power was eventually shut down due 
to a concern for firefighter safety in and around the blast area, causing the remaining occupants in the 
stairways to have to evacuate in complete darkness. 
As noted in Chapter 4 of this report, the tower buildings were designed to be maintained at a slight 
positive pressure by the building HVAC systems. When the building HVAC systems shut down due to 
loss of electrical power, the building was subjected to extreme stack effect forces, since at the time of the 
bombing the outside temperature was in the twenties (degrees Fahrenheit) (Isner and Klem 1993). 
Because the explosion caused penetrations into several elevator shafts in WTC 1 on the subgrade levels 
and lobby level, smoke was rapidly transported to the upper portions of the WTC 1 due to forces caused 
by the explosion and stack effect. A Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port 
Authority) engineer working on the 44th floor of WTC 1 when the explosion occurred reported that 
smoke reached his location about 1 min after the explosion, resulting in a rapid decrease in visibility 
(Isner and Klem 1993). Smoke eventually spread throughout WTC 1 and to a lesser degree to WTC 2. 
Although smoke spread to most areas of WTC 1 and WTC 2 as a result of the bombing, the event resulted 
in a relatively low loss of life, limited to the six people killed in the immediate area of the blast. Even 
though it took building occupants in some cases up to 3 hours to negotiate their way out of the building 
via the stairways, through smoke dense enough to dramatically reduce visibility, the smoke was diluted 
sufficiently such that only respiratory irritation was caused.

5.2.1 
Post-Event Building Modifications—1993 Bombing 
A review committee was convened by the City of New York, including representatives from the New 
York City building and fire departments and the Port Authority. The committee’s mission was to study 
the 1993 WTC bombing and determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the existing New York City 
building and fire codes as they related to high-rise buildings (World Trade Center Review Committee 
1994). With regard to smoke management systems, the committee concluded that the “complex issue of 
smoke control” was beyond the scope of the committee at that time and required future review. However, 
the committee recommended that building code requirements for smoke dampers should be clarified and 
that elevator lobbies should be provided in new high-rise buildings to resist the passage of smoke. Despite 
this recommendation, elevator lobbies are only required in high-rise residential buildings under the 
current provisions of the Building Code of New York City (BCNYC). 
The report concluded that stair pressurization systems, not installed in the WTC towers, would not 
function in an incident involving a mass evacuation due to the simultaneous opening of more than three 
stairway doors. The report did conclude, however, that the BCNYC, Reference Standard 5-18 lacked 
regulatory provisions for periodic testing and maintenance of stair pressurization systems and 
recommended that these requirements be added. Finally, the committee report recommended that the 
issue of providing fire towers in new high-rise commercial office buildings be revisited. The requirement 
for fire towers, stairways separated from the interior environment of the building via open-air balconies, 
was included in the 1938 edition of the BCNYC, but removed in the 1968 edition of the code. Provision 
of fire towers is not required under the current provisions of the BCNYC. 
A number of changes were eventually made to the buildings as a result of the committee’s 
recommendations, as reported by the Port Authority risk management staff in an article titled “The World 
Trade Center Complex,” published in Fire Engineering (Port Authority Risk Management Staff 1993). 
The enhancements made include the following: 
• 
1,600 emergency battery-powered lighting units were installed in exit stairways, elevator 
lobbies, and elevator cabs. 
• 
Phosphorescent signs were installed to guide the way to floor entry doors in exit stairways. 
• 
Phosphorescent tape-paint was applied to stair treads, handrails, and the perimeters of 
doorways in the exit stairways. 
• 
New fires alarm and communications systems were installed in each building with a separate 
command center located in each building. 
In a separate article published in the December 1993 Fire Engineering issue, titled “Fire Prevention and 
Building Restoration Activities” (Corcoran 1993), it was purported that emergency power was provided 
for smoke purge fans. No other sources were found to corroborate this assertion. 
5.2.2 
Important Considerations—1993 Bombing 
The 1993 bombing demonstrated that the stack effect could be a primary driver of rapid smoke spread 
through high-rise buildings. The bombing showed that large amounts of smoke can be transmitted to the

upper floors of a building due to a fire on a lower floor of the building, particularly when that fire 
produces a large quantity of smoke, such as was the case for the 1993 bombing. The 1993 bombing also 
clearly demonstrates that, as expected, stack effect is enhanced by openings created in the vertical shafts 
within the building, such as stair and elevator shafts. 
Smoke spread via the stairways was substantial in WTC 1 during the 1993 event due to the large number 
of open stair doors occurring as a result of the mass evacuation of occupants in the building. The 
stairways, which were designed with an exit capacity that met or exceeded prevailing code requirements 
for the buildings, did not provide the exit capacity to ensure rapid egress of all of the occupants of the 
building. As a result, doors remained blocked open by building occupants entering/exiting the stairways, 
increasing the magnitude of the airflow up the stairs due to stack effect. 
The 1993 bombing also clearly showed the importance of emergency power to maintain the function of 
building systems, including emergency lighting systems, in the event of a fire. 
5.3 
ENGINEERING STUDIES 
Between the time the WTC complex was constructed and the 2001 WTC disaster, several engineering 
studies were performed  to evaluate candidate smoke management system approaches for various areas of 
the complex. Three particular studies were conducted to examine smoke management systems in the 
towers (WTC 1 and WTC 2). These must be considered in the evaluation of the smoke management 
systems actually in place on September 11, 2001. 
5.3.1 
Prototype Stair Pressurization System Study 
Between 1976 and 1979, the Port Authority performed a study aimed at understanding the feasibility of 
providing stair pressurization systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 (PANYNJ 1979). 
Beginning in 1976, tests were conducted using building air handling systems located in the 7th floor 
mechanical equipment room (MER) and 41st floor MER of WTC 1, reconfigured to supply air to Stair C 
(Stair 3).  The goal of the tests was to meet the performance criteria outlined in Local Law No. 5, which 
was to provide 0.05 (12.5 Pa) in. H2O across closed stair doors with three doors open to the stair and 
0.1 (25 Pa) in. H2O across stair doors with all doors closed, along with a 35 lbf (156 N) maximum door 
opening force. 
The stair pressurization system study examined stair pressurization system performance with the building 
HVAC systems in normal mode and smoke purge mode. At the time of the study, the smoke purge 
sequence was defined as pressurizing the core using core supply ventilation and exhausting the interior 
spaces using the low pressure return fans.  Perimeter supply/exhaust fans were shut down in purge mode. 
The study demonstrated that the system as designed was unable to meet the performance criteria outlined 
in Local Law No. 5. With 3 doors open, differential pressures were generally low (approximately 0.03 in. 
H2O). With doors closed, door opening forces approached 35 lbf. The study concluded that stair 
pressurization systems should be installed based on the prototype design, with modifications being made 
to the design as stair pressurization technology improved. Based on the results of the study, construction 
drawings were prepared outlining the proposed stair pressurization systems. 
Chapter 5

60 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
Local Law No. 86 (enacted on December 13, 1979) stated that existing buildings shall be exempt from the 
smoke shaft and optional stair pressurization requirements if they were provided with automatic 
sprinklers throughout. A decision was made sometime after this date to fully sprinkler WTC 1 and 
WTC 2. As a result, stair pressurization systems were never installed in WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
5.3.2 
Rolf Jensen Smoke Movement Analysis 
Subsequent to the 1993 bombing, an analysis was performed by Rolf Jensen & Associates (RJA). 
Computer modeling was used to attempt to verify and explain the movement of smoke in WTC 1 
following the explosion (RJA 1995). The report also addressed the potential effectiveness of elevator 
venting, stair venting and stair pressurization to improve conditions in the building. 
RJA performed modeling using the SMOKESIM computer model, a precursor to the CONTAM model 
described in Chapter 8 of this report. The modeling effort only examined building airflows and pressure 
differentials, as the capabilities of the SMOKESIM model were not fully developed to handle 
contaminant (i.e., smoke spread) calculations for a building as large as the WTC towers. 
The RJA report concluded that the results of the modeling generally agreed with reported smoke spread 
given the wind/weather/damage conditions on February 26, 1993. The report also concluded that stair 
venting, defined as exhausting a stair using mechanical ventilation, was not an effective protection 
measure. Although stair venting decreases the amount of smoke migrating onto floor areas at the top of 
the building, it causes stack effect to be increased, and more smoke to be drawn into the stairs on the 
lower floors of the building. Elevator venting was found to improve overall conditions in the building. 
Stair pressurization was found to be feasible, and capable of maintaining adequate pressure (0.05 in. H2O) 
with stair doors closed. However, it was concluded that some sort of relief venting was needed at the top 
of each stair segment to relieve unacceptable door opening forces at the top of the stair due to stack effect. 
This was particularly true for Stair 3, which had the longest stair segment uninterrupted by a horizontal 
transfer corridor. 
With or without overpressure relief, stair pressurization was found to be capable of maintaining a slightly 
positive pressure in the stair with several doors open. However, as expected, positive pressure could not 
be maintained with all stair doors open, as would be the case in a mass evacuation scenario. 
5.3.3 
Hughes/Dillon Smoke Management System Evaluation 
During the same timeframe that RJA was conducting their smoke movement study (1994–1995), Hughes 
Associates, Inc. (HAI) and Dillon Consulting Engineers (DCE) were performing a joint study of smoke 
movement and control for the concourse and plaza portion of the WTC complex. The study evaluated 
proposed changes to the plaza/concourse level to add additional public (i.e., a food court, atria) and retail 
space. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed smoke control approach 
for the plaza/concourse levels. 
When the initial study was completed, HAI/DCE were asked to examine smoke management for the 
office buildings in the WTC complex, with a primary emphasis on the towers (WTC 1 and WTC 2). 
HAI/DCE were instructed to examine potential configurations using the existing HVAC systems in the

61 
towers to improve smoke control performance, without examining the provision of stair pressurization 
systems. 
The resulting study (HAI and DCE 1996) used the DOS-based computer model CONTAM96, another 
precursor to the windows-based CONTAM version of the model used to complete the analysis described 
in Chapter 8 of this report. A key component of the study was to use the model to examine system 
performance in terms of tenability (visibility distance, toxicity) as well as pressure differentials. System 
success could thus be achieved by maintaining acceptable smoke conditions in areas remote from the fire, 
even though sufficient pressure was not achieved to maintain total containment of the smoke. 
The HAI/DCE study examined numerous fire scenarios. The study examined fires originating in the Port 
Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) terminal, loading dock, parking garage, and lobby, as well as fires on 
various office floors. In addition, the study examined fire scenarios where the installed sprinkler system 
was assumed to fail to function, resulting in an uncontrolled fire on an office floor. Finally, wind and 
stack effects were examined. 
The study concluded that for most fire scenarios, a sequence involving pressurizing the core in the HVAC 
zone of fire origin and exhausting the perimeter office spaces (core pressurization) provided adequate 
smoke control performance. The study also strongly recommended that smoke management systems be 
activated automatically using smoke detectors installed in the building. This was a somewhat 
controversial recommendation as automatic activation of smoke management systems is generally not 
allowed for high-rise buildings in New York City. 
The HAI/DCE report provided a recommended sequence of operations that could be used to better control 
smoke given an uncontrolled fire event on a floor that involved visible flame and heat exiting the building 
via broken windows. The approach involves placing all of the HVAC systems in the building on supply 
only and shutting down return fans. This approach effectively pressurizes the entire building and forces 
smoke out the broken windows on the fire floor. It is cautioned, however, that this approach should only 
be used when occupants have already evacuated the fire floor and windows have been broken out due to 
the fire, as high door opening forces may be created. 
Several other recommendations were made involving the other buildings in the WTC complex. These 
findings are not summarized here because they do not impact WTC 1 and WTC 2. One interesting finding 
of the HAI/DCE study, however, pertains to the interrelationship of the buildings in the WTC complex. 
During the course of the study, measurements of airflows and pressures were taken at various points 
throughout the complex. It was found that during extremely cold ambient temperatures (15 °F [-9.4 °C] 
on the day of the test) and when many ventilation systems are shutdown (night mode), the neutral plane of 
the entire complex is at a height above the other tallest connected building in the complex, WTC 3 (the 
Marriott hotel, formally the Vista hotel). 
Because WTC 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were essentially connected to one another via the concourse and other sub-
grade levels, the substantial stack effect caused by the two towers created patterns of air flow toward the 
towers from the other buildings. Even at their uppermost floors airflow was into WTC 3, 4, and 5 from 
outside.  It was also found that a substantial source of air was drawn up the escalators in the concourse 
leading from the PATH station. This air in turn is being drawn through the PATH tunnel from the 
opposite side of the Hudson River, in New Jersey. Therefore, during extreme weather conditions, the air 
entering the PATH tunnel in New Jersey exited the top of WTC 1 and WTC 2 due to stack effect. The

implications of the interdependence of the various buildings in the WTC complex with regard to stack 
effect will be discussed further in Chapter 8 of this report. The computer modeling described in Chapter 8 
examines the impact of stack effect on smoke management system performance.

SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATION 
In order to document the smoke management systems, multiple documents were provided by the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port Authority) for review, in order to determine 
how the systems were designed and operated. These documents included the following: 
• 
Base building architectural and mechanical drawings for World Trade Center (WTC) 1, 2, 
and 7 
• 
Tenant retrofit architectural and mechanical drawings (when available) 
• 
Operations and maintenance manuals 
• 
Fire safety plans 
• 
Answers to questions posed via National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to the 
Port Authority and other knowledgeable personnel 
In the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2, information obtained that documented the operation of smoke 
management systems presented conflicting versions of how the systems operated. In the case of WTC 7, 
the base building systems installed when the building was constructed was modified/supplemented to add 
smoke management system capabilities during tenant retrofits. Instances where conflicting or incomplete 
information was provided are fully documented in this report. 
6.1 
WTC 1 AND WTC 2 
The tower buildings (WTC 1 and WTC 2) were equipped with a non-dedicated smoke management 
system (a smoke purge system) that utilized the base building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning 
(HVAC) systems that provided normal ventilation to the buildings. The smoke purge sequence is 
discussed in detail in Sec. 6.1.1 of this report. No dedicated smoke management systems were installed in 
the buildings. 
The normal base building HVAC systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 are summarized in Chapter 4 of this 
report. These HVAC systems could be manually aligned in a smoke purge mode that allowed smoke to be 
removed from the building. Smoke purge could only be accomplished for an entire ventilation zone 
served by a particular mechanical equipment room (MER) (ventilation zones are depicted in Fig. 4–4); 
thus, in the smoke purge mode the entire ventilation zone represented a single smoke zone. Because no 
operable fire/smoke dampers were present within the ventilation ductwork, it was not possible to provide 
the smoke purge, or any other smoke management sequence, on a floor-by-floor basis. 
Smoke detectors were located at the exhaust duct inlets on each floor and within the HVAC system 
ductwork in the MER to provide automatic shutdown of individual fans in the presence of smoke. 
Automatic shutdown of the ventilation systems could be overridden in the smoke purge mode.

6.1.1 
Sequence of Operations 
The fire safety plan for WTC 1 and WTC 2, revised in January of 1999 (PANYNJ 1999), defines smoke 
purge as the removal of smoke and other gaseous combustion products from the (fire) area “after a fire 
has been extinguished.” As documented in the fire safety plan, mechanical systems could be aligned to 
perform the smoke purge function by the Port Authority mechanical section staff when requested by the 
chief officer of the responding New York City Fire Department (FDNY) units. The FDNY would ask the 
WTC fire safety director to provide a smoke purge for a given zone. The WTC fire safety director would 
then instruct the mechanical section staff to perform the requested action. 
The smoke purge sequence is documented in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23, Operation and 
Maintenance of Fire Protection System, dated February 1986 (PANYNJ 1986). The documented 
sequence is as follows: 
Based on the information contained in the fire safety plan for WTC 1 and WTC 2 and WTC Instruction 
Manual No. 23, it could be concluded that the buildings were equipped with a manual purge system that 
utilized the interior zone exhaust fans serving the four quadrants of the building to remove smoke after a 
fire was extinguished. Core supply/exhaust fans and perimeter supply fans would be shut down. Smoke 
purge could be accomplished within each HVAC zone, the largest of which having 32 floors, as depicted 
in Fig. 4–4. However, a number of sources contain conflicting information regarding how the smoke 
purge system functioned and how it was intended to be used. 
Accounts of the 1975 fire (Powers 1975; Lathrop 1975) state that the smoke purge sequence pressurized 
the core with 100 percent outdoor air and exhausted 100 percent from the office spaces.  These accounts 
also state that during the 1975 fire, the smoke purge sequence for the fire floor and adjacent floors was 
initiated from the appropriate MER shortly after discovery of the fire, once police had examined the fire 
floor and identified the presence of a significant fire.  This documented sequence of events is important, 
as it signifies that the system was used at that time as an active fire protection system, to control smoke 
during the fire event and that the described “core pressurization” mode differed from the sequence of 
operations (Fig. 6–1) documented in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23. 
WTC Instruction Manual No. 23 makes the statement that “in the event of smoke in an interior tenant’s 
space involving personnel evacuation, the smoke purge procedure to be used is as follows…” In 
referencing an event involving personnel evacuation, this statement also implies use of the smoke purge 
sequence as an active fire protection sequence rather than a post-fire smoke cleanup sequence. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) report summarizing events on September 11, 2001, 
(McAllister 2002) states (in Sec. 2.1.3.3) that, “a zoned smoke control system…was designed to limit 
smoke spread from the tenant areas to the core area, thereby assisting both individuals evacuating from an 
area and those responding to the scene by limiting smoke spread into the core.” Again, this statement 
implies an active smoke management system based on the concept of pressurizing the core, which 
conflicts with the documented smoke purge sequence for the buildings.

Figure 6–1.  Documented smoke purge sequence of operations, WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
The Port Authority was asked to clarify the operation of the smoke purge sequence, since the available 
information regarding its intended operation provides conflicting accounts of smoke purge operation. 
According to the Port Authority,1 the operation of the smoke purge sequence is as follows: 
During a fire/smoke incident, the fans stayed in operation until shut 
down by a smoke detector on interlocking exhaust fans or at the direction 
of FDNY. FDNY would also direct what mode of operation the fans 
should be in. If fans were still operating, as would often be the case, the 
engineer at FDNY direction would key over to purge mode. This would 
sequence spill dampers to open 100 %. In addition, building operating 
procedure during a purge was to run the interior supply fans for purging 
[the] affected quadrant. During purge, the interior fan’s outside supply 
air dampers would go to 100 % open. For example, during a smoke 
incident on 38NE in tower one, ACS 41-6 [northeast interior supply fan] 
would be operating on purge, outside damper open 100 %. ACR 41-4,5 
and/or 6 [northeast interior return fans] would be operating on purge,

spills open 100 %. Core fans would not normally operate during a smoke 
purge unless conditions warranted and requested by FDNY. 
According to this version of the sequence of operations, smoke purge would occur by starting the supply 
and exhaust fans serving one of the four interior quadrants within a ventilation zone. Core supply/exhaust 
fans and perimeter supply fans would be shut down. HVAC systems serving the other ventilation zones in 
the building would be left operating unless they were shut down at the direction of FDNY. 
The Port Authority further recognized that WTC Instruction Manual No. 23 had not been updated since 
the base building fire alarm system was upgraded after the 1993 bombing. Therefore, this manual did not 
always reflect the most current fire protection system configuration1. 
Operation of the smoke management system for WTC 1 and WTC 2 could be achieved by aligning the 
equipment within the individual MERs or at a central control panel located in the Operations Control 
Center (OCC) located on the B1 level of WTC 2. At either location, building personnel had to perform 
two distinct operations: 
1. Aligning the HVAC systems in smoke purge 
2. Starting the appropriate HVAC fans 
Operation of the purge switch simply aligned all dampers that served as part of that quadrant’s HVAC 
systems in a 100 percent outdoor air configuration. Supply and spill dampers would be fully open, and 
return dampers would be closed. 
To achieve the smoke purge, it was up to the operator of the systems to turn on those fans necessary to 
achieve system operation. It would be equally possible to initiate an exhaust only type sequence as 
outlined in the fire safety plan, the core pressurization sequence (supply and exhaust operating) reportedly 
initiated during the 1975 fire, or the sequence stated by the Port Authority as the smoke purge sequence in 
effect on September 11, 2001. Alignment of the system would be up to the understanding of the operator 
as to the proper function of the smoke purge sequence, when called upon to initiate this sequence. 
With regard to the use of the smoke purge function to aid in active smoke management during a fire event 
versus during post-fire cleanup operations, it would be up to the responding fire department personnel to 
initiate system operation. Depending on the type of fire event, it is possible that the system could have 
been used either during the fire or after it was extinguished. 
For the purposes of this report, the function of the smoke purge system documented by the Port 
Authority1 was assumed to be in effect on September 11, 2001. It was also assumed that the system was 
to be used after the fire was extinguished, at the discretion of the responding fire department personnel.

6.1.2 
Applicable Code Requirements 
Individual code requirements of the BCNYC that pertain to smoke management are discussed in Sec. 3.2 
of this report. At the time the buildings were constructed, the ability to provide a smoke purge from each 
HVAC zone was the only smoke management system provided in the buildings. Local Law No. 5 
retroactively imposed the requirements for smoke shafts for existing high-rise buildings when it was 
enacted in 1973. In lieu of such smoke shaft(s), stair pressurization systems could be provided. 
In order to respond to the requirements of Local Law No. 5, the Port Authority initiated a pilot study into 
the requirements for pressurizing the exit stairs in WTC 1 and WTC 2. This pilot study is discussed in 
Sec. 5.3.1. Stair pressurization was examined as a means of meeting the requirements of Local Law No. 5 
since the smoke shaft requirements would have been prohibitive for a building the size of WTC 1 and 
WTC 2. The smoke shaft requirements contained in reference standard Reference Standard 5-17 called 
for the capability of providing 60 air changes per hour in the largest compartment served, which would 
have required the capacity to exhaust 300,000–400,000 ft3/min from each floor of the towers being 
exhausted. This was clearly outside the capabilities of the existing ventilation systems. 
Existing buildings that were sprinklered throughout were exempt from the smoke shaft and optional stair 
pressurization requirement by Local Law No. 86 (enacted in 1979). A decision was made at some 
subsequent time to fully sprinkler the WTC buildings. Therefore, the Port Authority did not move forward 
with the stair pressurization option. Because WTC 1 and WTC 2 were fully retrofitted with automatic 
sprinklers, smoke and heat venting and/or stair pressurization was not required in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on 
September 11, 2001. 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were equipped throughout with fire dampers at duct penetrations into vertical shafts. 
Combination fire/smoke dampers were not required by the code to be provided in existing buildings. 
Since tenant retrofit projects generally connected to the existing base building systems, fire/smoke 
dampers at HVAC shafts were not generally provided during tenant retrofits. This was verified by 
examining the mechanical drawings for the Marsh & McLennan tenant retrofit in WTC 1, considering this 
retrofit occurred in the years just prior to the events on September 11, 2001. 
6.1.3 
Emergency Power 
Emergency power was provided subsequent to the 1993 bombing for WTC 1 and WTC 2, serving all 
emergency systems (lighting, fire alarm system, etc.) and the building elevators. While one account 
summarizing the building restoration activities following the 1993 bombing (Corcoran 1993) purported 
that emergency power was provided for smoke purge fans, no other sources were found to corroborate 
this assertion. According to the Port Authority,1 emergency power was not provided to WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 base building smoke purge fans. However, the MERs were equipped with redundant power 
sources from different substations. 
No other redundant features were identified with respect to the HVAC systems used to accomplish the 
smoke purge functions. No back-up systems or emergency power was provided.

6.1.4 
Fire/Smoke Dampers 
According to the Port Authority,1 all of the base building duct penetrations through fire rated partitions 
were equipped with fire dampers. There were no smoke dampers in the base building HVAC system, 
except for those within the air handling unit serving the Windows on the World restaurant in WTC 1. The 
smoke dampers were designed to segregate the restaurant from tenant floors below. 
6.2 
WTC 7 
WTC 7 was equipped with a dedicated smoke management system (a smoke purge system) that utilized 
dedicated HVAC equipment that served only a smoke management function. This type of system differed 
from that used in WTC 1 and WTC 2, which used the HVAC systems that provided normal ventilation to 
the buildings to perform the smoke purge function. The smoke purge sequence for WTC 7 is discussed in 
detail in Sec. 6.2.1 of this report. 
The HVAC systems serving WTC 7 are summarized in Chapter 4 of this report. As stated in Chapter 4, 
dedicated smoke exhaust fans/dampers could be manually aligned at the fire command center to provide 
smoke purge from a specified floor within the building. Since the smoke purge function could be 
provided on a floor-by-floor basis, each floor of the building constituted an individual smoke control 
zone. 
6.2.1 
Sequence of Operations 
The WTC 7 fire safety plan (PANYNJ 1988a) specifies the sequence for emergency exhausting of heat 
and smoke as follows: 
Heat and smoke exhausted from the building by activation of smoke 
purge and related air handling upon report of fire. 
The fire safety plan does not identify the responsibility for activating the smoke purge system, the means 
for activating the system, or the location from which it was to be activated. However, the building was 
provided with a Class E fire alarm signal center (BCNYC Reference Standard 17-3A), which required fan 
control to be provided at the Fire Command Station, which was located in the 3rd floor main lobby in 
WTC 7 (PANYNJ 1988a). 
The building operations manual for WTC 7 (PANYNJ 1988b) specifies three alarm modes pertaining to 
operation of the building HVAC systems. ALARM-1 initiated shutdown of HVAC equipment based on 
duct smoke detection. ALARM-2 initiated smoke purge on the affected floor. ALARM-3 specified the 
smoke purge sequence for non-affected floors. The smoke management sequence pertaining to the smoke 
purge function involved exhausting the fire floor and pressurizing the remaining floors with supply air. 
The documented sequences (PANYNJ 1988b) are shown in Fig. 6–2.

6.2.2 
Applicable Code Requirements 
Individual code requirements of the Building Code of the City of New York (BCNYC) are discussed in 
Sec. 3.3 of this report. Local Law No. 16 required that all buildings in occupancy group E (business) be 
provided a manual override capability to be capable of exhausting one floor at a time at a rate of six air 
changes per hour, or 1 cfm/ft2, whichever is greater. WTC 7, having a footprint area of approximately 
48,000 ft2, would require an exhaust capacity of at least 48,000 ft3/min (81,552 m3/h) to be consistent with 
the code. As documented in Chapter 4 of this report, the base building system serving the lower floors of 
the building provided a smoke exhaust capacity of 36,000 ft3/min (61,164 m3/h), which was not consistent 
with the minimum value specified by code. An 84,000 ft3/min (142,716 m3/h) exhaust fan was provided 
for the SSB floors during the tenant retrofit, which exceeded the capacity required by code. 
WTC 7 was sprinklered throughout and was, therefore, exempted from the requirement for stair 
pressurization systems. The building was provided with a Class E fire alarm system per code, was 
provided with emergency power serving all emergency systems, and was equipped throughout with fire 
dampers at duct penetrations into vertical shafts, consistent with the BCNYC.

EVALUATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
As discussed in Chapter 1 of this report, expected system performance was evaluated for postulated 
design fires in business occupancies, as well as documentation of the expected performance of fully 
functional smoke management systems in World Trade Center (WTC) 1 and WTC 2. 
Evaluation of hypothetical design fires, smoke management modes, and building configurations is 
documented in Chapter 8 of this report. First, the expected function of the installed smoke management 
systems, given the actual events on September 11, 2001, was evaluated. 
As discussed in Chapter 6, the smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 were designed to 
provide a manual smoke purge function. Given the design and intended operation of the smoke 
management systems, two key questions must be answered to approximate the performance of the system 
on September 11, 2001: 
1. Was manual operation of the smoke purge systems in either WTC 1 or WTC 2 initiated by 
emergency response personnel? 
2. Were the systems capable of operating given the damage caused by the aircrafts impacting 
each building? 
In order to answer the second question, damage to both the building electrical and mechanical systems 
must be evaluated. It must first be determined whether electrical power was available to the building 
mechanical systems subsequent to impact so that they were capable of operating. Then, potential damage 
to heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system components must be evaluated to determine 
if the systems were capable of performing as designed. 
7.1 
ACTIONS OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL 
The events of September 11, 2001, clearly represented an extreme challenge, both to emergency response 
personnel and to the installed building systems. The damage caused by an aircraft impact into a building 
is outside the range of typical design considerations for the design of most building systems, including 
fire protection systems. In addition, from a fire department perspective, a fire involving multiple floors of 
the uppermost portion of WTC 1 or WTC 2, or worse in both buildings simultaneously, represents a 
difficult operational environment. 
A comprehensive accounting of New York City Fire Department (FDNY) policies, procedures, and 
performance in connection with the events on September 11, 2001, was assembled by Howard Safir, the 
former commissioner of FDNY and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) (Safir 2002). Safir’s 
report reflects findings from interviews with FDNY personnel and analysis of publicly available sources. 
Dennis Smith’s book Report From Ground Zero (Smith 2002) also documents fire department operations 
on September 11, 2001.

The battalion chief established a command post in the lobby of WTC 1. According to the Safir report, the 
battalion chief attempted to determine the floors of impact, which he estimated as near the 80th floor. The 
deputy division chief arrived at the WTC 1 lobby command post approximately 3 min after the battalion 
chief and assumed command. The deputy division chief’s account of the events stated that “all building 
services were out. The elevators weren’t working; there were no communications lines established” 
(Smith 2002). 
According to the Safir report, upon his arrival at WTC 1 the battalion chief met the then-acting WTC fire 
safety director. The two worked to address the situation with the elevators and discussed the condition of 
water and power sources. The battalion chief, deputy division chief, and the WTC fire safety director then 
conferred and issued the order to evacuate WTC 2. No recommendation was given to initiate a smoke 
purge sequence, nor was smoke purge performed on September 11, 2001, to their knowledge1. The deputy 
division chief met with the WTC 1 fire safety director, who put his engineers to work to gain control of 
the elevators and building communications systems (Safir 2002). 
Initial FDNY operations at WTC 1 were focused on dispatching fire department personnel arriving at the 
building to assist in rescue efforts and on responding to distress calls from people stuck at various 
locations within the building, including elevators. The responding FDNY officers focused on rescue 
efforts rather than trying to extinguish the fire (Safir 2002). 
Subsequent to the second aircraft impact into WTC 2, two other chiefs were dispatched to the lobby of 
WTC 2, to set up a command post there (Smith 2002). There is no record of either chief having initiated a 
smoke purge sequence in WTC 2. First hand accounts of their actions are not available as both chiefs 
perished during the collapse of WTC 2. 
Radio and phone traffic from various sources (New York City police and fire departments, the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey [PANYNJ or Port Authority] police, and WTC 
mechanical/electrical/structural divisions) was reviewed in an effort to determine if any attempts were 
made to manipulate building ventilation systems or initiate the smoke purge sequence locally from one of 
the mechanical equipment rooms (MERs) in WTC 1 or WTC 2. One reference to smoke purging was 
found. WTC channel 25/radio channel B was used by the WTC maintenance and electrical shops at the 
WTC. For a period of time from roughly 10 to 25 min after the aircraft impact into WTC 1, radio traffic 
was received from a person on radio “structural five” from “Stair A” on the 103rd floor in WTC 1. 
Structural five reported heavy smoke in the stairway and some time between 20 and 25 min after impact 
was recorded as transmitting the message “Need immediate purge.” At roughly the same time, an 
unidentified male was recorded on the same radio channel transmitting the message “Electric, we have 
Staircase C (inaudible), is there any way to pump any outdoor air in?” No conversations were identified 
confirming use of the ventilation systems.

The exact extent of damage within individual floors of WTC 1 and WTC 2 may never be known, since 
the collapse of the buildings prohibited a detailed inspection of the impact area. However, the potential

extent of damage can be estimated based on the results of engineering analysis and based on observations 
recorded by people located within WTC 1 and WTC 2 at the time of the events. 
Preliminary damage estimates identified damage areas based on damage to structural columns within the 
core of WTC 1 and WTC 2.1  These preliminary damage estimates are included in Appendix A of this 
report and were used to provide a first order estimate of the potential damage caused to building electrical 
and mechanical systems in order to estimate whether the smoke purge sequence had the potential to 
function properly during the events that occurred on September 11, 2001. 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) damage estimates included in Appendix A 
were overlaid onto representative floor plans for the impact areas in WTC 1 and WTC 2 in order to 
determine the potential damage to key electrical/mechanical system components located in the core 
spaces. Damage estimates for WTC 1 and WTC 2 are shown in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2, respectively. In these 
figures, only those floors where major structural damage in the core was estimated are shown. 
Figures 7–1 and 7–2 depict damage estimates to key electrical/mechanical system components located in 
the core spaces. The preliminary NIST damage estimates are used to define the impact area on each of the 
three primary floors where the majority of core damage was expected. A hypothetical boundary is also 
shown for shaft damage caused by impact debris, given the fact that the shafts in the building are 
constructed using gypsum wallboard construction and are susceptible to impact damage. 
The location of the HVAC shafts used for interior zone ventilation are shown in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2, as 
these are the primary HVAC systems used to accomplish the smoke purge sequence. The locations of the 
three electrical closets/risers providing power to the upper floors of the building are also shown. The 
locations of exit stairways and freight elevator 50 are also shown, as damage witnessed to these shafts can 
be used to verify the extent of shaft damage throughout the core. 
The damage estimates shown in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2 can be corroborated to a certain extent using 
observations made by people located in various locations in the buildings after aircraft impact. The 
observations primarily have to do with stair shaft damage, damage to freight elevator 50, and in some 
cases elevator shafts. HVAC shaft data could be corroborated using visual evidence of smoke spread seen 
from the exterior of the buildings. An attempt was also made to corroborate the extent of core damage 
using observations as to the presence of power in the buildings. 
Part of the NIST WTC Investigation included an aircraft impact damage analysis of WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
The final results of these analyses are provided in NIST NCSTAR 1-2.  Once the damage estimates were 
finalized, they were compared to the initial damage estimates (Figs. 7–1 and 7–2) developed that were 
used for the purposes of this analysis of active fire protection systems.  The main areas of interest with 
respect to the smoke management systems are damage to vertical shafts.  The debris fields of the revised 
damage estimates were determined to indicate damage to vertical shafts, on one floor or another, to a 
similar degree indicated by the preliminary damage estimates.

7.2.1 
Exit Stair and Elevator Shaft Damage 
Numerous accounts were recorded of all three exit stairs in WTC 1 being blocked on the 92nd floor and 
above. Multiple calls received by the Port Authority police desk reported rapidly worsening smoke 
conditions and blocked exits from the Windows on the World restaurant, located at the top of WTC 1 
(NYPD 2001). Several occupants contacted friends and family via email or cell phone from floors above 
the impact floors and reported heavy amounts of smoke and all exits blocked (Beyler 2002). Several 
employees from Carr Futures, located on the 92nd floor of WTC 1, placed calls to family and reported 
that the exit stairs were impassible (Cauchon 2001). Two of the three occupants that escaped from the 
91st floor  reported that only two of three exit stairs were accessible due to debris in the exit corridor 
(Beyler 2002). 
Of the two accessible stairs, one was blocked with pieces of gypsum wallboard from above. The other 
exit stair had some debris in the stair but was passable. A Port Authority architect located on the 88th 
floor of WTC 1 identified the open exit stair as “Stair C” (Murphy 2002), which, based on the description 
provided in his account, was the northwest exit stair (Stair 1). These accounts would tend to support the 
damage estimates depicted in Fig. 7–2, as far as core shaft damage enveloping the footprint of the three 
exit stairs. On the lower floors in the impact area, Stair 1 (the northwest stair) is furthest removed from 
the identified impact damage area, due to the orientation of the aircraft as it impacted the north face of the 
building. 
The extent of damage into the core of WTC 1 is also evidenced by damage to elevator shafts in the core, 
particularly freight elevator 50. A notable event occurring in WTC 1 was a reported “explosion/fireball” 
that occurred in the lobby of WTC 1 due to jet fuel that was ignited at the base of an elevator shaft, 
witnessed by three survivors (Beyler 2002). This is evidence of a major opening created into one of the 
full height elevators in the impact zone. Freight elevator 50 and two express elevators connecting the 
lobby floors to the Windows on the World Restaurant on the 106th floor and observation deck were the 
only full height elevators in this area. The preliminary damage estimates depicted in Fig. 7–1 indicate 
damage as far into the core as freight elevator 50 and potentially as far as the express elevators. Since the 
elevator doors on the lobby level for freight elevator 50 open to a corridor within the core, and the doors 
to the express elevators face outward toward the exterior walls of the lobby where the “explosion/fireball” 
damaged the exterior walls, this is further evidence of core damage as far in as the express elevator shafts. 
Damage to local elevator shafts was also evident based on survivor testimony. The base of the local 
elevator shafts serving the impact zone in WTC 1 was the 78th floor sky lobby. Two occupants that 
escaped noted fire in a vertical shaft coming out through gaps in a shaft wall as they passed through the 
sky lobby (Beyler 2002). The marble walls encasing the elevators on this level were also noted to have 
buckled and snapped (Beyler 2002). Another survivor reported jumping through large “drops” of blue 
flame to exit an open elevator door on the 78th floor (Beyler 2002). 
Figure 7–2 depicts damage estimates for core spaces in WTC 2. Compared to WTC 1 (Fig. 7–1), damage 
to the core was not estimated to be quite as extensive due to the projected path of the aircraft through the 
building and orientation of the building’s core. 
In WTC 2, the core layout was such that the three exit stairs were located remotely from one another on 
the impact floors. As shown in Fig. 7–2, the northwest stair in the building (Stair 1) was relatively 
undamaged. At least four survivors were able to safely exit the building via Stair 1, from floors as high as 
Draft for Public Comment 
Evaluation of System Performance on September 11, 2001 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
77 
the 91st floor (Murphy 2002; Cauchon 2001). It appears that more people could have escaped via Stair 1 
but chose not to go down through the smoke in Stair 1 near the floors of impact or chose to try to exit by 
accessing the roof, but found the roof doors locked (Cauchon 2001). 
As seen in Fig. 7–2, the full-height freight and express elevators were located out of the way of the 
postulated path of impact. Given that there were limited accounts of spread of flaming jet fuel to lower 
levels via the elevator shafts, unlike WTC 1, this is likely a reasonable assumption. The availability of 
survivor testimony for WTC 2 regarding fires in elevator shafts is not as prevalent since the primary 
floors of impact in WTC 2 are near the bottom of the local elevator shafts, just above the 78th floor sky 
lobby. 
Since damage to two out of three exit stairs was substantiated by survivor testimony and significant 
damage was caused to the exterior walls in the northeast corner of WTC 2 caused by impact damage, the 
path of damage would also logically include the ventilation shafts located on the east half of the impact 
floors, as depicted by the damage estimates shown in Fig. 7–2. 
7.2.2 
Exterior Observations 
Potential damage to the HVAC shafts was determined to some degree by examining photographic 
evidence depicting the exterior of the buildings after the time of aircraft impact. As was shown in 
Fig. 4–4, the WTC 1 impact zone was located in the uppermost HVAC zone of the building, serving the 
92nd through 107th floors from the 108th floor MER, while the WTC 2 impact zone was located in the 
HVAC zone serving the 59th through 91st floors from the 75th floor MER. Thus, the MER serving the 
impact zone was located above the impact zone in WTC 1 and below the impact zone in WTC 2. 
As shown in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2, initial damage estimates support damage to the HVAC shafts in one-half 
of each building within the impact zone. Such damage would create large holes in the gypsum wallboard 
exhaust shafts and potentially shear off or collapse metal supply ductwork. If the HVAC shafts were 
undamaged, the fire dampers at the HVAC shaft walls would have been expected to close in an intense 
fire, limiting the extent of airflow via the ventilation shafts. Fire dampers would not be expected to be as 
effective in limiting smoke spread as combination fire/smoke dampers, which are designed to be smoke-
tight and close earlier in the fire event due to activation of the integrated smoke detectors installed as part 
of the damper assembly. 
In WTC 1, spread of large amounts of smoke via the ventilation shafts is evident in the examination of 
pictures of the exterior of WTC 1 after impact. Figure 7–3 depicts views of WTC 1 from the north and the 
west. A significant amount of smoke is observed coming out of the 108th floor MER from a localized 
spot on the north face of the building, and that smoke seems to exit from the MER along the length of the 
west face of the building. Figures 4–6 and 4–8 depict the supply and exhaust system layout in a typical 
MER (shown for WTC 2). At the 108th floor MER in WTC 1, the localized smoke emanating from the 
north face of the building corresponds to the location of the supply fan inlet for the northwest interior 
supply zone. The exhaust plenum for the northwest quadrant exhaust fans is located along the west face of 
the MER. The visual evidence depicted in Fig. 7–3, showing smoke exiting from the 108th floor MER, 
supports damage to the primary ventilation shaft serving the northwest quadrant of the impact zone, 
depicted in Fig. 7–1.

Since the damage estimate suggests similar damage to the northeast shaft, a similar pattern of smoke 
exiting the 108th floor MER would be expected to be seen at the northeast supply inlet and east exhaust 
outlets. However, due to the direction of the wind driven smoke plume from the fire toward the southeast, 
it is difficult to see patterns of smoke emanating from the MER at this location on the exterior of the 
building. Therefore, large amounts of smoke exiting supply/ventilation shafts serving the northeast 
quadrant of the impact zone, which would substantiate the shaft damage to the northeast quadrant 
ventilation shafts depicted in Fig. 7–1, could not be verified using visual observations of the exterior of 
the building. 
Once smoke enters the ventilation ductwork, it can very quickly spread to all areas of the upper floors of 
the building via the air distribution plenum in the ceiling. However, smoke entering a floor via elevator 
doors might have to pass through multiple barriers in the core and office space to reach the perimeter 
offices. As a result, smoke spread via the ventilation shafts has the potential to cause a more rapid 
deterioration of smoke conditions in the perimeter office spaces than smoke spread via the elevator and 
stair shafts. 
Rapid spread of smoke vertically via the ventilation shafts in WTC 1 is supported by the fact that smoke 
conditions became untenable (high heat/high toxicity) on the uppermost floors of WTC 1, where people 
were observed breaking windows to obtain outdoor air and some jumped from the building to escape the 
rapidly deteriorating conditions in the building. This occurred shortly after impact in WTC 1. The FDNY 
noted people jumping from the building shortly after their arrival in the lobby of WTC 1 (Smith 2002). 
In WTC 2, shaft damage (stair/elevator/ventilation shafts) would also cause smoke to spread upward 
through the building. However, in WTC 2 the MER is located below the impact zone. Therefore, smoke 
would spread upward via the shafts to floors up to the 91st floor and outward onto those floors. Smoke 
would have to spread upward into the building to floors above the 91st floor through the other primary 
vertical airflow paths, which in this case were local elevator banks III-C and III-D, as depicted in  
Fig. 4–3. 
The relatively few vertical airflow paths between the impact zone in WTC 2 and the uppermost floors of 
the building is supported by the length of time conditions remained tenable in some areas of the upper 
floors of the building. Numerous occupants of WTC 2 were trapped on the 105th floor of the building. 
These people decided not to go down through the smoke in Stair 1, and tried during the initial period after 
impact to get to the roof, but found the doors locked. Most people returned to the 105th floor and several 
people called family members on their cell phones. One occupant was on the phone with his wife until the 
collapse of WTC 2 (Beyler 2002). The experience of occupants on the 105th floor supports the fact that 
spaces in the uppermost portion of WTC 2 were tenable for periods as long as 45 min after impact. 
7.2.3 
Status of Power 
An attempt was made to identify the presence of power or lack thereof up to the MER floors serving the 
impact zones in WTC 1 and WTC 2, utilizing survivor testimony and transcripts of phone calls made by 
people trapped above the impact zone. Little evidence was available regarding the presence of electrical 
power, particularly on the upper floors of the buildings. Isolated reports were noted of “lights flickering” 
and going out in the buildings. These accounts also correspond to floors where ceiling collapse and other

minor structural damage was noted. Therefore, loss of lighting could coincide with local structural 
damage rather than being indicative of an overall loss of electrical power. 
There were two data points of note identified with regard to loss of power. A phone call recorded by the 
Port Authority police desk from the Windows on the World restaurant on the 106th floor of WTC 1 
appears to indicate that electrical power and fire phones were out (NYPD 2001). Given the path of aircraft 
damage in WTC 1 (Fig. 7–1) and the relative location of the electrical closets/risers, this may be evidence 
of a loss of power to the upper floors of the building due to damage to the electrical risers. 
In WTC 2, a survivor noted the presence of power on the 74th floor during his descent from the 84th floor 
(Murphy 2002). This observation may be evidence of the presence of power up to the floors of impact in 
WTC 2. 
Despite the lack of definitive survivor testimony with regard to the presence of electrical power in WTC 1 
and WTC 2, the damage estimates in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2 support damage to one or more of the electrical 
closets/risers in each building. In WTC 1, damage likely occurred to both the north and central electrical 
closets/risers. In WTC 2, damage likely occurred to at least the east electrical closet/riser. 
7.3 
SUMMARY 
Examination of the available evidence provides strong indications that the smoke management systems in 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 played no role in the events that occurred on September 11, 2001. There is no 
evidence to support the fact that an attempt was made to activate the smoke purge sequence. In the chaos 
surrounding the events, the focus following the aircraft impacts and preceding the collapse of the 
buildings was on rescue operations. 
Should a decision have been made to attempt to align the building ventilation systems into the smoke 
purge mode, it is doubtful that this would have had any impact on overall smoke conditions within the 
building. First, upon arriving at the scene, FDNY personnel had a difficult time determining the exact 
floors of impact, especially for WTC 1. Since the WTC 1 impact occurred near the boundary between 
ventilation zones at the 91st/92nd floors, and the impact was thought to have originally occurred on floors 
somewhere between the 80th and 90th floors (Smith 2002), smoke purge may have been inadvertently 
initiated for the 59th through 91st floor HVAC zone in WTC 1. 
The aircraft impacts caused significant damage to the core spaces in both WTC 1 and WTC 2, making it 
unlikely that the smoke purge could have been accomplished in either building. In WTC 1, it is likely that 
the impact eliminated or significantly impaired electrical power on floors above the impact zone. 
Therefore, because power would not have been available at the 108th floor MER, serving the zone of 
impact, HVAC systems would not have been operational. In addition, the ventilation shafts for at least the 
north half of the building were likely damaged, thus reducing the possibility for the smoke purge to 
function properly even if the HVAC systems had been operable. 
In WTC 2, it is possible that electrical power may have been available to the fans located in the 75th floor 
MER, which was located below the impact zone in this building. Survivor testimony indicates that power 
may have been available up to the 75th floor. Initially, all fans would have shut down due to detection of 
substantial quantities of smoke by the duct smoke detectors. As shown in Fig. 7–2, the HVAC shafts 
utilized to accomplish smoke purging would likely have been damaged on the east side of the building,

eliminating half of the smoke venting capacity for the floor. Even if the ventilation shafts on the west side 
of the building remained intact, the performance of the smoke venting system would have been reduced. 
This would have had a particularly detrimental impact on WTC 1, where smoke conditions deteriorated in 
the uppermost portions of the building at a much faster rate than WTC 2.

EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL SMOKE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS 
In the previous chapter it was determined that, based on the available information, the smoke purge 
sequence provided for the ventilation systems in World Trade Center (WTC) 1 and WTC 2 was not 
initiated during the events occurring on September 11, 2001. It was further concluded that it is highly 
probable that the electrical system and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system 
components involved in the smoke purge function were critically damaged. Even if the smoke purge 
sequence was initiated, it is unlikely that the smoke purge would have performed as designed. 
In order to fully understand the potential impact of smoke management systems for events like those 
occurring on September 11, 2001, it is desirable to analyze how various smoke management system 
configurations might have performed in WTC 1 and WTC 2, had they been available on September 11. 
To develop an understanding of the capabilities of the various smoke management system configurations 
that were evaluated it is also important to analyze their performance for other hypothetical fire scenarios 
in high-rise buildings, both typical/expected design scenarios and worst case scenarios. 
8.1 
SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM APPROACHES 
Five distinct smoke management approaches were examined for the WTC towers. These approaches are 
as follows: 
1. Smoke purge 
2. Core pressurization 
3. Building pressurization 
4. Sandwich pressurization 
5. Zoned smoke control with stair pressurization 
Four of the five approaches evaluated are smoke management configurations that could have been 
achieved using the building HVAC systems as they existed prior to September 11, 2001, with little to no 
modification. However, unless automatic activation of a smoke management system was provided, the 
HVAC systems would have had to be manually aligned, requiring pre-planning of the sequence of 
operation to be used.  The fifth approach, zoned smoke control with stair pressurization, is a smoke 
management system based on state of the art methods of smoke control practices on September 11. Use of 
this approach would have required major renovations to building systems to achieve the desired 
performance. 
All of the smoke management system approaches modeled assumed that electrical power was available to 
operate the necessary HVAC systems. The CONTAM computer program was used to evaluate the

pressure differentials achieved once the system was aligned per the appropriate sequence of operations. 
Because automatic activation of the smoke management system is not standard practice in New York City 
(HAI and DCE 1996), it must be recognized that substantial smoke movement may occur prior to manual 
system operation, regardless of the smoke management approach adopted for the building. 
8.1.1 
Smoke Purge 
The smoke purge approach is based on the documented smoke purge sequence for WTC 1 and WTC 2 as 
it appears in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23, Operation and Maintenance of Fire Protection System, 
dated February 1986 (PANYNJ 1986), as discussed in Chapter 6 of this report (see Fig. 6–1). The 
sequence involved placing the interior HVAC zone exhaust fans and core exhaust fans (toilet exhausts, 
elevator machine room (EMR) exhausts) in the multi-floor ventilation zone containing the fire in 
100 percent exhaust mode. HVAC systems in all other ventilation zones in the buildings were aligned in a 
summer normal mode.  Perimeter supply fans were shut down. The sequence of operation for the smoke 
purge mode is summarized in Table 8–1.

As discussed in Chapter 6, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port Authority) 
stated that a different smoke purge sequence than that documented in WTC Instruction Manual No. 23 
was in place at the time of the events on September 11, 2001. This sequence involved using the interior 
supply and return fans serving only one quadrant of a ventilation zone to purge the zone of smoke. 
Because the supply and return fans would both be used, this sequence would not be expected to create a 
significant pressure differential between the core and perimeter spaces. The purge would not be expected 
to greatly improve conditions within the building during the fire event. 
Since the success of the smoke management approaches being evaluated is based on the pressurization 
method of smoke control, the sequence reported by the Port Authority (see Section 6.1.1) was not 
evaluated using the CONTAM model. This sequence, which involves supplying to and exhausting from a 
given quadrant at an equal air flow rate, would not be capable of achieving a pressure differential with 
respect to adjacent areas of the building. 
8.1.2 
Core Pressurization 
The core pressurization approach is a slight variation of the documented smoke purge sequence for 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, in that the supply fans rather than the exhaust fans in the core were activated to 
pressurize the core in an effort to limit smoke spread into the core from the surrounding office spaces. As 
documented in Chapter 6, accounts of the 1975 fire and other sources cite this variation as being the

Building Pressurization 
Building pressurization is an approach that was recommended in the 1996 Hughes Associates 
Incorporated (HAI)/Dillon Consulting Engineers (DCE) Smoke Management Evaluation Study (HAI and 
DCE 1996). This approach was recommended to be used in the event of a severe fire involving a 
substantial portion of one floor of the building, where windows were observed to be broken out. The 
approach involves turning on the supply fans in the entire building and turning on the exhaust fans only in 
the ventilation zone of fire origin. The intent of this approach was to exhaust smoke where possible from 
the floor containing the fire, and to induce a substantial airflow toward the floor of fire origin to force 
smoke out of the broken windows. The core pressurization approach was not adopted as part of the fire 
safety plan for the building subsequent to the 1996 study. The sequence of operation for the building 
pressurization mode is summarized in Table 8–3.

Sandwich Pressurization 
The sandwich pressurization approach was not previously examined for WTC 1 and WTC 2 in any of the 
engineering studies reviewed in the preparation of this report. The approach analyzed is not the classic 
floor-by-floor “sandwich” approach, which involves exhausting the floor of fire origin and pressurizing 
the floors above and below. The HVAC systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 were not equipped with operable 
fire/smoke dampers; thus, it was not possible to configure the system to exhaust and supply to only single 
floors within a ventilation zone. Instead, an approach was examined where the sandwich was achieved by 
ventilation zones. 
In the event of a fire, the ventilation zone of origin would have all of its exhaust fans turned on, and 
supply fans turned off. The ventilation zones above and below would have all supply fans activated and

exhaust fans turned off. These actions would create a multi-floor sandwich effect in the building, with the 
net effect being the creation of a pressure differential between the core and perimeter spaces within the 
HVAC zone of fire origin. The sequence of operation for the sandwich pressurization mode is 
summarized in Table 8–4.

Zoned Smoke Control With Stair Pressurization 
The final approach analyzed was a hypothetical approach based on best practices in smoke management 
system design enforced in many jurisdictions in the United States as of September 11, 2001. It was 
assumed that the building was retrofitted with stair pressurization systems, as required for all new high-
rise construction by the major building codes in the United States, and that the HVAC system was 
capable of exhausting on a floor by floor basis within the ventilation zone containing the fire to create the 
desired pressure differential with respect to the floors above and below. Other ventilation zones were 
assumed to operate in the summer normal mode. It was assumed that operable fire/smoke dampers were 
also installed in all supply/exhaust ducts at the appropriate shaft connections and that these dampers were 
closed within the zone of fire origin. The sequence of operation for the zoned smoke control with stair 
pressurization mode is summarized in Table 8–5.

The capability to provide floor-by-floor exhaust could be achieved in one of two ways. The first option 
would be to provide variable speed drives for the interior exhaust zone fans to reduce their flow rate to 
provide the desired rate of exhaust from a single floor, with the exhaust dampers on that floor being open. 
The constant volume fans installed in the building provided such a high a rate of exhaust that directing all 
of the available exhaust from a single floor within the ventilation zone would create high pressure 
differentials that could lead to the creation of unacceptable door opening forces. The second option would 
be to provide dedicated smoke exhaust fans having the desired flow rates to pressurize a single floor.

DESIGN FIRE SCENARIOS 
Several different design fire scenarios were evaluated for WTC 1 and WTC 2, encompassing the range of 
expected fires that could be envisioned within the office spaces of the building. The fire scenarios were 
limited to those that could occur on the above-grade office floors of the building. Other possible fire 
scenarios could have resulted in smoke migration through the towers due to a fire in the sub-grade areas 
or adjacent spaces within the WTC complex. Several of these fire scenarios (i.e., truck dock fire, car fire 
in the garage, fire in the concourse) were evaluated in the 1996 HAI/DCE study (HAI and DCE 1996). 
Because the focus of this report is on examining the fires that occurred on September 11, 2001 (which 
occurred on the uppermost floors of the building) and bounding these events with other comparable fires, 
it was desirable to examine only those fire scenarios on the office floors of the building. The design fire 
scenarios that were evaluated are as follows: 
• 
Sprinklered fire 
• 
Full-floor burnout 
• 
Two-floor fire 
• 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, fire scenarios (no shaft damage) 
• 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, fire scenarios (shaft damage assumed) 
8.2.1 
Sprinklered Fire 
By September 11, 2001, WTC 1 and WTC 2 had been fully retrofitted with a full coverage automatic 
sprinkler system on all of the office floors of the buildings. A typical fire in a sprinklered building would 
typically involve only a single fuel package, or a small number of adjacent fuel packages and would either 
be controlled by the automatic sprinkler system or be extinguished. A simplifying assumption is to 
assume that the temperature in the zone of origin never exceeds the operation temperature of the 
sprinklers, which had an activation temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) in WTC 1 and WTC 2 (NFPA 2000b). 
Given the large size of the majority of the office spaces in the towers, some of which encompassed an 
entire floor, the average temperature throughout the floor would be expected to be less than the assumed 
165 °F. 
The sprinklered fire scenario represents the least challenging fire scenario analyzed for WTC 1 and 
WTC 2. As discussed in Sec. 2.1.2, a pressurization smoke management system in a sprinklered building 
is only required to provide a design pressure differential of 0.05 in. H2O across the smoke zone boundary 
due to the reduced temperature of the smoke produced from a sprinklered fire. 
8.2.2 
Full-Floor Burnout 
The full-floor burnout is a design fire scenario for a fire involving the contents of a typical office 
building. In a fully-sprinklered building, a full-floor burnout would only be possible in the case of a 
catastrophic failure of the sprinkler system, or with a fuel load that exceeds the capacity of the sprinkler 
system. The full-floor burnout scenario is essentially the same as the “uncontrolled fire” scenario 
analyzed in the 1996 HAI/DCE study (HAI and DCE 1996). The 1996 report references testing performed 
Chapter 8

at the National Research Council Canada (NRCC) which demonstrated that mobile shelving units in an 
office building can overtax standard light hazard sprinkler system designs (Lougheed, Mawhinney and 
O’Neil 1994). 
Two prominent examples of office buildings where full-floor burnout on single or multiple office floors 
occurred (albeit in non-sprinklered buildings) are the First Interstate Bank fire in Los Angeles 
(Nelson 1989) and the One Meridian Place fire in Philadelphia (Klem 1991). In each of these fires most 
of the windows broke out on the fully involved fire floor. 
The full floor burnout fire scenario evaluated in this report assumed a temperature on the floor of fire 
origin of 1,800 °F (1,000 °C), consistent with the temperature assumed in the 1996 report for fully 
involved fires. This fire scenario assumed the break-out of 58 windows on each face (as assumed in the 
1996 study) to sustain roughly a 250 MW fire. 
8.2.3 
Two-Floor Fire 
The two-floor fire scenario corresponds to a multi-floor event caused by a small explosion. The purpose 
of this fire scenario was to examine smoke management system performance for a multi-floor fire 
scenario of far less severity than the aircraft impacts that occurred on September 11, 2001. This scenario 
also challenges the typical floor-to-floor separation that exists in building fire scenarios with an intact 
floor slab. 
The fire scenario assumes that a small explosion has opened up a 100 ft2 hole in the floor slab at the 
midpoint along one of the faces of the building. The explosion does no damage to the core but causes half 
the windows on the near face of the building to be blown out by the blast. It is assumed that sprinkler 
piping may be damaged, but some sprinklers operate, to reduce the overall temperature on the two open 
floors of the building. The average temperature on the two floors is assumed to be identical to that of the 
sprinklered fire scenario, 165 °F (74 °C). Use of this temperature does not represent a worst-case two- 
floor scenario. Rather, in contrast to the relatively high temperatures assumed for the multi-floor WTC 1 
and WTC 2 aircraft impact fire scenarios (discussed in Secs. 8.2.4 and 8.2.5), the low temperature was 
assumed in order to examine the smoke management system effectiveness where the increased exterior 
wall leakage and the two-floor fire are the primary challenge to the smoke management system. 
8.2.4 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (No Shaft Damage) 
A hypothetical fire scenario was envisioned in which the majority of the structural damage occurring on 
September 11, 2001 was modeled, but with no damage occurring to the building’s core. This scenario, 
although unlikely, was modeled to estimate the performance of the candidate smoke management system 
approaches for a scenario involving a multi-floor fire event with high temperatures throughout the fire 
compartment and large openings in the exterior of the building. 
8.2.5 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (Shaft Damage 
Assumed) 
This design fire scenario was used in an attempt to model smoke management system performance under 
the conditions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. Estimates of the size of the exterior

openings after aircraft impact (McAllister 2002), including impact damage and window breakage, were 
used, along with the preliminary damage estimates provided by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) (Appendix A), to model the damage conditions existing within each building. A full 
accounting of the opening areas assumed in the models of each building is provided in Appendix B. 
Where the extent of damage was unknown, the damage was estimated. The sensitivity of the model was 
checked to see how the results would vary for wide variations in the assumed extent of damage. For 
example, the size of the hole between floors within the impact zone was difficult to estimate. The models 
used a floor opening equal to the footprint of the impact damage depicted in the NIST damage figures, up 
to but not including the core. Several model runs were then conducted varying the size of the holes (larger 
and smaller by factors of 2) to verify that this variable did not have too great an effect on the pressure 
differentials predicted by the model (see Runs 55, 55b, 55c—Table 8–6c). Although the final damage 
estimates to the building slabs presented in NIST Special Publication 1000-7 were somewhat less than the 
initial estimates (Figs. 7–1 and 7–2), this analysis revealed that the resulting pressure differentials were 
not overly sensitive to the size of the holes in the slabs. 
Several estimates of the temperature within the impact zone in the towers were made, ranging from as low 
as 750 °F (400 °C) in some areas of the impact zone (Beyler 2002) to as high as 1,800 °F (1,000 °C) in 
the hottest areas of the impact zone (McAllister 2002).  Both the lower and the higher temperature were 
used to model the temperature throughout the impact zone in the model runs (described in Sec. 8.4) in 
order to bound the range of expected performance for the candidate smoke management system 
approaches. For all cases the outside air temperature was modeled as 70 °F (21 °C) with the wind out of 
the north at 11.2 mph (5 m/s). 
8.3 
METHODS OF ANALYSIS 
All of the smoke management approaches analyzed utilized some variation of the pressurization method 
of smoke management, as described in concept in Sec. 2.1.2. The pressurization method is the smoke 
management system design method for well-compartmented structures with low-ceiling spaces. 
The performance of each of the smoke management approaches, given the postulated design fire 
scenarios, was evaluated using the CONTAM building airflow and contaminant dispersal model, 
developed by NIST.  CONTAM is identified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), in the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook (ASHRAE 2001) and the 
ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002), as well as National Fire 
Protection Association (NFPA) standard 92A (NFPA 2000a) as an appropriate tool for the evaluation of 
smoke management systems that are based on the pressurization method of smoke management. 
Construction of the CONTAM model used in the analysis is discussed in Appendix B of this report. 
Calibration of the model is discussed in Appendix C. 
Although the CONTAM model used was based on architectural/mechanical drawings of WTC 1, it was 
used to evaluate scenarios in both WTC 1 and WTC 2 because the buildings were very similar. None of 
the other buildings in the WTC complex were included in the model. The 1996 HAI/DCE study 
determined that the buildings interacted due to their connections, with the neutral plane for the complex 
being located above all of the other buildings in the complex other than the towers. Therefore, CONTAM 
runs that evaluated stack effects on smoke management system performance are only indicative of the

potential impacts of stack effect on the buildings in isolation, as the impact of the other WTC buildings 
was not included in the model. 
8.3.1 
CONTAM Building Airflow Model 
CONTAM 2.1 (Walton and Dols 2003) is the latest, Windows- based version in the CONTAM family of 
public domain multi-zone building airflow and contaminant dispersal models developed by NIST. 
Version 2.0 (Dols and Walton 2002) was used in this study because for the purposes of this study, the 
simulation capabilities are essentially the same. 
The program combines state-of-the-art algorithms for modeling airflow and contaminant analysis in 
multi-zone buildings. Methods for using CONTAM to evaluate the performance of smoke management 
systems are documented in the ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002) 
and in the engineering literature (Ferreira 2002). 
CONTAM utilizes a graphic SketchPad interface to create an idealized representation of a building in 
terms of zones that are connected by airflow paths. The SketchPad illustrates the connection between 
zones, openings between zones (i.e., flow paths), ventilation system components, and contaminant 
sources and sinks (which were not used for this study). The SketchPad is used to establish the geometric 
relationships of the relevant building features. It is not intended to produce a scale drawing of the 
building; rather, it is used to create a simplified model where the walls, zones, and airflow paths are 
topologically similar to the actual building (Dols, Walton, and Denton 2000). 
CONTAM is capable of modeling wind effects on the building, as well as stack effects caused by 
differences between a building’s interior temperature and the exterior temperature. Simplified HVAC 
system models and a detailed ductwork sub-model are available to evaluate the effect of HVAC systems 
on contaminant spread. The sub-model is capable of modeling re-circulating as well as 100 percent 
outdoor air ventilation systems, although in the case of smoke control, re-circulating HVAC systems are 
seldom used. The positions of doors and windows as well as HVAC system capacities can be varied over 
time using the model’s schedule feature. 
In order to use CONTAM to model smoke flow within a building, a number of limitations must be taken 
into account (Ferreira 2002). First, each zone is treated as a well-mixed volume. Temperature or 
contaminant stratification within a zone, as would be the case given a hot smoke layer, is not taken into 
account. Also, while individual temperatures can be assigned to each zone, a temperature cannot be 
assigned to individual contaminants. Thus, the buoyancy-induced flow exhibited by smoke, particularly in 
those zones closest to the fire, is not taken into account. CONTAM has been shown to provide relatively 
good agreement with empirical data for airflows at or near ambient temperatures (Emmerich 2001). 
Validation studies have not been performed to evaluate the use of CONTAM to model buoyant flows. 
Because buoyancy-induced flows have the potential to play an important role in smoke spread, the 
CONTAM model is best suited for those applications where buoyancy effects are minimized. For 
instance, sprinklered buildings are better suited to use of the CONTAM model than are non-sprinklered 
buildings. Upon sprinkler activation in the room/zone of fire origin, the sprinkler water spray cools the 
hot smoke and stirs the smoke layer, driving some smoke down to the floor level. Although some degree 
of stratification does occur, stratification is not nearly as great as with an unsprinklered fire scenario 
(Tamura 1994). The mixing that occurs better approximates CONTAM’s assumption of a well-mixed

91 
zone, meaning that each zone is characterized by a single temperature, pressure, and contaminant 
concentration at any given point in time. However, pressure does vary hydrostatically with elevation 
within each zone. The reduced smoke temperature reduces the extent of the buoyancy-induced flow 
associated with the smoke. 
Buildings that are highly compartmented are also better suited to using CONTAM, particularly those that 
are broken up into multiple compartments using smoke barriers.  Confining a fire to a specific volume 
will aid in the development of a well-mixed volume. Smoke spread across the smoke barriers will be 
predominately governed by forces such as wind, stack effect, and HVAC systems operation. Smoke 
spread from the confined compartment due to buoyancy can also be better approximated by defining an 
elevated smoke temperature in the room/zone of fire origin and using this temperature as the mechanism 
for buoyant spread across the compartment boundaries in the model. Once smoke has migrated from the 
room of fire origin, it is either cool enough where the buoyant forces are minimized or additional 
sprinklers may activate to further aid in the creation of a well-mixed volume in the adjacent spaces. 
In buildings that are not sprinklered or where individual zones are connected by large openings, such as 
were caused due to the events on September 11, 2001, buoyancy may play a more predominant role in 
smoke spread. When used for modeling smoke movement where buoyant flow is expected to be the 
predominant factor in the spread of smoke, CONTAM is most appropriately used to examine “far-field” 
conditions. Far-field conditions exist in those areas of a building further from a zone containing a fire, 
where cold-smoke conditions prevail. Far-field smoke conditions better approximate the well-mixed zone 
volume assumed in the model. “Near-field” conditions exist in those areas of the building close to the fire, 
in which hot-smoke conditions result in buoyancy induced smoke flow. 
Figure 8–1 depicts the problem with using CONTAM where buoyant flow of smoke is expected to be the 
primary factor in smoke spread through the building. The right side of Fig. 8–1 shows buoyant flow 
conditions where smoke flows from a fire compartment to another compartment at some level above, via 
a vertical shaft. In reality, the temperature of the smoke cools as it rises up the shaft. The temperature 
gradient affects the pressure differentials throughout the shaft and, ultimately, between the shaft and the 
upper compartment. As shown in Fig. 8–1, the flow into the upper compartment is a function of T1 
through T7. In CONTAM, the temperature of each compartment must be specified by the user. The model 
does not perform an energy balance to determine the temperature of the smoke as it moves throughout the 
building; thus, temperature is not carried along as a property of the migrating smoke. In the model, then, 
the flow into the upper compartment is only a function of the difference between T0 and T1. 
In order for smoke movement behavior to be adequately modeled using CONTAM, the near-field 
behavior of the smoke must be accounted for using other appropriate tools.  Models such as the 
Consolidated Fire and Smoke Transport Model (CFAST) developed by NIST can be used to approximate 
near-field conditions where buoyancy is a concern (Peacock, Jones and Bukowski 1993).  CFAST would 
be used to estimate the temperature of intermediate spaces (i.e., T1 through T7 in Fig. 8–1).  However, 
using CFAST as a basis for selecting inputs into CONTAM compounds the uncertainty related to 
combining the models.  Further research is needed to quantify the uncertainty and to develop the best 
strategies for coupling fire models to CONTAM.

Little information is available regarding the validation of CONTAM’s handling of wind. However, any 
uncertainty inherent in the model is outweighed by uncertainties in selecting wind coefficients for the 
various exterior faces of a building. In the absence of detailed wind tunnel test data for a building, the 
coefficients used are at best rough approximations. 
8.3.2 
System Performance Criteria 
The 1996 HAI/DCE smoke management study performed for WTC 1 and WTC 2 (HAI and DCE 1996) 
utilized not only pressure differentials, but also smoke tenability (i.e., temperature, visibility, toxicity) as 
system performance criteria. In some of the cases modeled in the 1996 study, smoke escaped the floor of 
fire origin. As long as the smoke migrating to other areas of the building did not violate pre-defined 
tenability criteria, the performance of the system was judged to be a success. 
Based on a review of the various issues relating to the use of tenability (dilution) analysis, it was 
determined that the performance of the candidate smoke management approaches described in Sec. 8.1 
would be evaluated based solely on the ability to provide pressure differentials consistent with the 
pressurization method of smoke control (see Sec. 2.1.2). Several concerns were identified related to the 
evaluation of whether acceptable tenability was maintained in remote areas of the building using a 
particular smoke management system approach. 
First, as discussed in Sec. 2.1.2 of this report, use of a smoke management approach based on diluting 
smoke to provide a tenable environment is not recommended in the space containing the fire. In spaces 
Draft for Public Comment 
Evaluation of Potential Smoke Management System Effectiveness 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
93 
remote from the fire, acceptable dilution of smoke may be achieved if the volume of the remote space is 
relatively large or the air change rate in the space is high relative to the amount of smoke migrating from 
the fire compartment. Several of the design fire scenarios evaluated, including the WTC 1 and WTC 2 
aircraft impact scenarios, involved the creation of large openings that allowed smoke to travel to remote 
areas of the building above the impact region; therefore, significant airflow volumes would be necessary 
to accomplish dilution. 
Establishing meaningful, conservative tenability criteria was also a concern given the large volumes of 
smoke migrating through the buildings and the nature of the primary fuel involved in the fire (jet fuel). 
Methods for assessing smoke tenability are discussed in the ASHRAE text Principles of Smoke 
Management Systems (Klote and Milke 2002) and within various chapters of the Society of Fire 
Protection Engineers’ SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (Mulholland 2002; Purser 2002). 
However, these references do not provide definitive tenability criteria to be used for assessing acceptable 
occupant exposure limits. Selection of appropriate tenability criteria is left up to the evaluating engineer, 
based on consideration of the fuel(s) involved in the fire and type(s) of occupants within the building. 
Furthermore, some tenability criteria such as smoke temperature and toxicity are a function of time of 
exposure to the smoke. Methods are available for calculating egress times (Proulx 2002; Nelson and 
Mowrer 2002), but calculation of egress time is a function of many factors affecting human behavior in 
fire that may introduce uncertainty into this type of calculation. 
Finally, as discussed in Sec. 8.3.1, the CONTAM model is not well equipped to handle the modeling of 
scenarios where gas temperature is a primary driver of air (smoke) flow. Other methods (i.e., use of fire 
models) would be necessary to estimate the effects of buoyancy driven flow within the model. These 
methods introduce further uncertainty into the results obtained with the model. 
Because of the various uncertainties involved with determining acceptable tenability in remote areas of 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 using the CONTAM model, particularly for the aircraft impact scenario, smoke 
management system performance was evaluated based on the ability to contain smoke to the compartment 
of fire origin using pressure differentials. As discussed in Sec. 2.1.1, the various codes and standards that 
reference the use of pressurization smoke control require the provision of 0.05 in. H2O (12.5 Pa) pressure 
differentials in sprinklered buildings and 0.1 in. H2O (25 Pa) in non-sprinklered buildings to contain 
smoke. These pressures are measured with a building’s HVAC systems placed in smoke management 
mode, without the presence of a fire. The required pressure differentials are high enough to contain heated 
smoke were a fire to be present in sprinklered and non-sprinklered occupancies, and are used for design 
purposes. 
The modeling performed using CONTAM includes the temperature of the fire compartment as a 
parameter in the model. Therefore, it is only necessary that the system maintain a positive pressure 
differential to contain smoke when the barrier across which the pressure is maintained is fairly tight. For 
barriers containing large openings, creation of a positive pressure differential may not be sufficient to 
contain smoke. Unless sufficient airflow velocity is applied to hold back the smoke, two-way flow will 
occur. Heated smoke will flow from the fire compartment at the uppermost portion of the large opening, 
and pressurization air will be introduced into the fire compartment through the lower portion of the large 
opening. 
A rough approximation of whether pressurization air may be capable of prohibiting passage of smoke 
from the fire compartment through a large opening may be obtained using equations pertaining to the 
Chapter 8

airflow method of smoke control, discussed in Sec. 2.1.1. As stated in NFPA 92B (2000b), the limiting 
airflow velocity for sprinklered spaces is on the order of 300 ft/min (1.5 m/s), while the limiting airflow 
velocity for unsprinklered spaces is on the order of 600 ft/min (3 m/s). 
8.3.3 
Calibration of the Model 
As part of the 1996 HAI/DCE study, a model of WTC 1 was constructed using an earlier version of 
CONTAM (Walton 1997). This model was used as the baseline to which modifications were made to 
perform the current modeling effort documented in this report. As discussed in Appendix B, many 
changes to the existing model (hereafter referred to as the 1996 CONTAM model) were necessary to 
allow it to be used for the current modeling effort. Many of the changes were made to reflect lessons 
learned over the intervening years with regard to use of CONTAM to model the performance of smoke 
management systems in high-rise buildings. The 1996 study was one of the earliest uses of CONTAM to 
model smoke movement and control in large high-rise buildings. 
As part of the 1996 study, calibration measurements were made of actual airflows and pressure 
differentials obtained at various locations in WTC 1 for different ventilation modes. At the time, a crude 
calibration was performed in order to develop the building model used to perform the analysis in the 1996 
study. 
For the current modeling effort, the 1996 calibration data was reviewed, and an attempt was made to 
calibrate the model to match the data. Appendix C documents the calibration of the model. As discussed 
in Appendix C, several uncertainties existed with regard to the accuracy of the reported data, and the 
determination of the exact configuration of the building (openings and HVAC system alignment) at the 
time the calibration measurements were made. 
After extensive effort, it was determined that a single building configuration could not be developed that 
conclusively matched the 1996 calibration data. The primary problem was the existence of too many 
independent variables (leakage types, wind/weather conditions, HVAC system alignments, design versus 
measured supply/return airflows, and unknown architectural changes to individual floor plans) to allow 
for a single building model that matched all of the data for the various ventilation modes. 
It was determined that in order to accurately represent the uncertainty involved in the type of modeling 
being performed, and the potential range of results given this uncertainty, that three separate building 
configurations would be carried forth in the modeling. These configurations, described in detail in 
Appendix B, are as follows: 
• 
Configuration A—Best estimate of building parameters (i.e. leakage areas, HVAC system 
airflows, etc.), based on available building information. 
• 
Configuration B—Configuration A ventilation system parameters changed in order to 
better match data from different ventilation modes tested. 
• 
Configuration C—Configuration A assumed leakage values changed in order to better 
match data from different ventilation modes tested.

RESULTS OF ANALYSIS 
A total of 180 model runs were conducted using CONTAM to evaluate the performance of the candidate 
smoke management system approaches for the proposed design fire scenarios.  The results of these model 
runs are shown in Table 8–6.  The results presented in Table 8–6 are grouped in banded sets of runs for 
each fire scenario.  Within each set of runs, each of the three potential building configurations (A, B, 
and C) were repeated for each fire scenario. 
Tables 8–6a through 8–6e show the pressure differential achieved across key vertical and horizontal 
leakage paths for given smoke management mode/fire scenario combinations. Positive pressures signify 
airflow in a direction outward from the stairs/elevators, to the core, and into the office spaces. Thus, 
positive pressures mean desirable system performance with respect to conditions in the core/stairs. 
Negative pressures signify airflow in the opposite direction, into the core and into the vertical shafts, and 
indicate the probable spread of smoke to other floors of the building. 
The fire floor is generally modeled as the 80th floor, which corresponds to a floor of impact in WTC 2 on 
September 11, 2001. This floor was selected in order to provide a direct comparison to results obtained 
for the WTC 2 September 11 fire scenarios. The ambient temperature modeled was also generally 70 °F 
(21 °C), the reported temperature in New York City on the morning of September 11, 2001 
(McAllister 2002). Within each group of modeling runs, building configuration A, B, or C was sometimes 
repeated, with the fire floor changed to a lower floor in the building (15th floor) and the ambient 
temperature changed to 15 °F (-9.5 °C). This was done to examine system performance under maximum 
stack effect conditions, as 15 °F is the design winter temperature for New York City listed in the ASHRAE 
Fundamentals Handbook (ASHRAE 2001). 
Given the uncertainty associated with the construction of the model, it is not appropriate to examine an 
individual data point as an absolute indicator of whether it is possible to maintain the required pressure 
differential. Rather, the entire set of data should be reviewed as a whole, as an indicator of whether the 
candidate smoke management system would be capable of providing pressure differentials in the desired 
range for that fire scenario. 
8.4.1 
Sprinklered Fire Scenario–Results 
The CONTAM modeling results for the sprinklered fire scenario are shown in Table 8–6a. As previously 
stated, the sprinklered fire scenario assumed a temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) in the zone of fire origin, 
which is conservative for a sprinklered fire in a large open plan office space. 
The results show that all of the five candidate smoke management approaches evaluated would be capable 
of providing at least a positive pressure across the tenant doors on the floor of fire origin. So long as the 
doors remained closed, the pressure differential would be sufficient to contain smoke to the office space 
on the floor of fire origin. 
For some of the smoke management approaches, the pressure differential provided by the system would 
decrease for a fire on a lower floor (15th floor) in the event of a design stack effect condition (15 °F [-9.5 
°C]); however, positive pressure could be maintained for building configuration A.

It is important to note that for all of the approaches except for the zoned smoke control with stair 
pressurization, the pressure differentials become negative at one or more of the exit stairways. In each of 
the other approaches, the stairways are not pressurized; therefore, air from other portions of the building 
pressurizing the core on the fire floor may cause the flow direction to be into one or more stairways on the 
fire floor. This means that if smoke should enter the core during the fire, due to a tenant door being 
blocked open or some other means, smoke could be forced into the exit stairways. 
Stair 3 generally maintains a positive pressure in all of the smoke control modes except for core 
pressurization mode under extreme stack effect conditions (Run 8). As seen in Fig. 4–3, this stair only has 
one interruption via a transfer corridor as it rises vertically through the building, as opposed to five 
transfer corridors in Stairs 1 and 4 transfer corridors in Stair 2. This lack of interruption allows more 
supply air to enter the stair on other floors and effectively pressurize Stair 3 in the various smoke 
management modes modeled. 
8.4.2 
Full-Floor Burnout Scenario–Results 
The CONTAM modeling results for the full-floor burnout case are shown in Table 8–6b. A temperature 
of 1,800 °F (1,000 °C) in the zone of fire origin was assumed for this fire scenario (as in the 
1996 HAI/DCE study). 
The results show that for the case of a full-floor burnout, the buoyancy driven pressure differentials 
overcome the ability of the smoke purge and core pressurization configurations to maintain adequate 
pressure differentials (0.05 in. H2O [12.5 Pa]). Flow direction is into the core via the tenant doors, and 
then into freight elevator 50 and the three exit stairs. This would likely result in smoke spread to other 
floors via the stairs/elevator shafts. 
For the building pressurization smoke management approach, significant pressure differentials are created 
due to the fact that the supply air provided throughout the entire building flows to the fire floor and exits 
the building via the windows assumed to be broken out by the fire. For all building configurations, the 
simulated pressure differentials across tenant doors and stair doors were well in excess of the 0.36 in. H2O 
maximum pressure differential that would result in the 30 lbf maximum allowable door opening force (for 
use in a means of egress) recommended by NFPA 92A (2000a), assuming a 3 ft by 7 ft (0.91 m 
by 2.13 m) standard door dimension. This is consistent with observations made during the 1996 study, 
which is why one of the recommendations of the 1996 HAI/DCE study was not to use building 
pressurization unless it was verified that all occupants had exited the building. 
Both the zoned smoke control and sandwich pressurization approaches are successful in maintaining 
positive pressures across the tenant doors. The success of both approaches is aided by the ability to 
pressurize the core, using stair pressurization in the zoned approach and airflow via the elevator shafts 
from other ventilation zones in the building in the sandwich approach. However, as documented by 
run 32, the zoned approach is sensitive to stack effect as negative pressures in freight elevator 50, Stair 3, 
and other vertical shafts cause the core space to become negatively pressurized, resulting in negative 
pressure across the tenant doors. 
The zoned smoke control approach involves exhausting the zone of fire origin to create the desired 
pressure differentials, which also has the positive result of removing smoke from the zone of fire origin. 
While this approach was demonstrated to be successful for the sprinklered fire scenario, where barrier

integrity is expected to be maintained, the ability of this approach to maintain a pressure differential is 
greatly impeded when large openings are created in the exterior boundary of the zone, as is the case due 
to window break-out in the full-floor fire scenario. 
8.4.3 
Two-Floor Fire Scenario—Results 
The CONTAM modeling results for the two-floor fire case are shown in Table 8–6b. A temperature of 
165 °F (74 °C) in the zone of fire origin was assumed for this fire scenario. The intent of modeling this 
fire scenario was to examine the effect of moderate openings in the exterior of the building, as well as an 
increase in the effective volume of the zone of fire origin, due to the postulated opening in the floor slab, 
on smoke management system effectiveness. 
The results show that the smoke purge and core pressurization configurations were not capable of 
maintaining adequate pressures to contain smoke (0.05 in. H2O [12.5 Pa]). Flow direction is into the core 
via the tenant doors, and then into freight elevator 50 and the three exit stairs. The reversal in flow 
direction is caused by the fact that for each approach, the floors in the multi-floor ventilation zone 
containing the fire are at a net-negative pressure. The openings created on the two fire floors in the 
exterior of the building result in the interior exhaust pulling air directly from the outside. Therefore, the 
other non-fire floors within the zone become more negative than the floors of fire origin, resulting in the 
flow of air into the vertical shafts and then out onto the other floors within the ventilation zone. This 
would result in smoke spread throughout the building. 
For the building pressurization smoke management approach, significant pressure differentials are again 
created due to the fact that the supply air provided throughout the entire building travels to the fire floor 
and is then able to exit the building via the windows broken out by the fire. The pressure differentials 
across tenant doors and stair doors are well in excess of the 0.36 in. H2O maximum pressure differential 
that would result in the 30 lbf maximum allowable door opening force, and would be expected to impede 
occupant egress from the building. 
The zoned smoke control and sandwich pressurization approaches both are successful in maintaining 
positive pressures across the tenant doors. As previously stated, the success of both approaches is aided 
by the ability to pressurize the core, using stair pressurization in the zoned approach and airflow via the 
elevator shafts from other ventilation zones in the sandwich approach. Again, the zoned approach is 
sensitive to stack effect as negative pressures in freight elevator 50, Stair 3, and other vertical shafts cause 
the core space to become negatively pressurized, resulting in negative pressure across the tenant doors. 
8.4.4 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (No Shaft Damage)—
Results 
Table 8–6c shows the results for the WTC 1 and WTC 2 fire scenarios that model the extent of damage 
due to the aircraft impacts into each building on September 11, 2001. It was assumed that no damage 
occured to the core and that the damage to the exterior and floor slabs was consistent with the impact 
damage described in Appendixes A and B of this report. 
The intent of the no shaft damage simulations was to determine whether a smoke management system 
might be effective given a multi-floor fire zone heated to an elevated temperature, but where the integrity 
of the core is maintained. It is recognized that maintaining the integrity of the core after an aircraft impact

into the building would be difficult, regardless of the building materials that were used in constructing the 
core. The purpose of this scenario is to evaluate whether core damage would be the primary contributing 
factor to the success or failure of a candidate smoke management system approach. 
In order to evaluate the results of the September 11, 2001, fire scenarios, it is important to note that the 
aircraft impact created a large, multi-floor zone with openings to the outside via damage to the building 
envelope and openings to the interior core spaces. The temperature throughout the impact zone is 
assumed to be uniform, at either 750 °F (400 °C) or 1,800 °F (1,000 °C). The temperature within the 
multi-floor zone creates a buoyant airflow due to localized stack effect within the zone caused by the high 
temperature. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 8–2. 
 
Figure 8–2.  Effect of core pressure on airflows in impact zones. 
As shown in Fig. 8–2, air flows into the impact zone on lower floors and out of the impact zone on higher 
floors. Only when the positive pressure in the core is high enough can sufficient pressure be maintained 
on all floors of the impact zone. 
Columns in Table 8–6c list the high and low pressures achieved across tenant doors, with the floor the 
pressure occurs on listed next to the pressure differential in brackets. Table 8–6c shows that for the smoke 
purge, core pressurization, and zoned smoke control approaches, in both WTC 1 and WTC 2, pressure is 
positive (out of the core) on the lower floors of the zone and negative (into the core) on the upper floors 
of the impact zones. The core pressurization approach does maintain very low positive pressures for 
several model configuration/temperature combinations. However, given that negative pressures occur in 
other cases and due to the uncertainty inherent in the model, this smoke management system approach 
was determined to be unable to contain smoke to the impact zone on all floors. 
The results differ between buildings for the building pressurization and sandwich pressurization 
approaches. For WTC 1, positive pressure is maintained on all floors. For WTC 2, adequate pressure is 
not maintained for the uppermost floors of the impact zone. The reason for the disparity in results

99 
between the two buildings is the difference in location of the aircraft impacts into the two buildings 
relative to the mechanical rooms that served the impact zones. As shown in Fig. 4–4, the mechanical 
equipment room (MER) serving the impact zone was located above the impact zone in WTC 1 and was 
located below the impact zone in WTC 2. 
Both the building pressurization and sandwich pressurization approaches make use of supply air from the 
other ventilation zones as part of each smoke management approach. For the building pressurization 
mode, both the supply and exhaust ventilation are operated in the zone of fire origin, but only supply is 
operated in the other zones. Since the supply and exhaust ventilation in the zone of fire origin were 
assumed to cancel each other out from a pressure standpoint, a higher net positive pressure is achieved 
within the building when the uppermost ventilation zone served by the 108th floor MER is the zone of 
fire origin. 
A similar effect occurs in the sandwich pressurization mode. This approach involves exhausting the 
ventilation zone of fire origin and supplying air to the other zones. When large openings are present to the 
exterior on the fire floor(s), the exhaust ventilation is able to pull air directly from the outside, and 
therefore, does not contribute to the pressure differential across the core/office barrier. Positive pressure 
must be achieved from the core relative to the office spaces via supply air coming from the rest of the 
building. Again, the building is at a higher net positive pressure when the floors served by the 108th floor 
MER are the floors of fire origin; thus, the difference in performance noted between WTC 1 and WTC 2 
in Table 8–6c. 
8.4.5 
WTC 1 and WTC 2, September 11, 2001, Fire Scenarios (Shaft Damage 
Assumed)—Results 
Table 8–6d shows the results for the WTC 1 and WTC 2 fire scenarios that model the extent of damage 
due to the aircraft impacts into each building on September 11, 2001, assuming shaft damage occurred, as 
postulated. The extent of core/shaft damage is discussed in Sec. 8.2.4 (and Appendixes A and B). 
As previously stated, it is important to note from a multi-zone modeling perspective that the aircraft 
impact created a large, multi-floor zone with openings to the outside via damage to the exterior wall and 
openings to the interior core spaces. As shown in Fig. 8–2, air flows into the impact zone on lower floors 
and out of the impact zone on higher floors. Only when the positive pressure in the core is high enough 
can sufficient pressure be maintained on all floors of the impact zone. 
In Table 8–6d, columns list the high and low pressures achieved across tenant doors, with the floor on 
which the pressure occurs listed next to the pressure differential in brackets. Table 8–6d shows that for the 
smoke purge, core pressurization, and zoned smoke control approaches, in both WTC 1 and WTC 2, 
pressure is positive (out of the core) on the lower floors of the zone and negative (into core) on the upper 
floors of the impact zones. These smoke management system approaches fail to contain smoke to the 
impact zone on all floors. 
As with the results for the undamaged core scenarios discussed in Sec. 8.4.4, the results differ between 
buildings for the building pressurization and sandwich pressurization approaches. For WTC 1, positive 
core pressure is maintained relative to the office spaces on all floors. For WTC 2, adequate pressure is not 
maintained between the core and perimeter office spaces for the uppermost floors of the impact zone. As 
Chapter 8

previously discussed, the reason for the disparity in results between the two buildings is the relative 
location of the aircraft impacts into the two buildings. 
Due to the shaft damage, the positive pressure differentials maintained by the building pressurization and 
sandwich pressurization approaches in WTC 1 are very low on the upper floors of the impact zone, less 
than 0.01 in. H2O (2.5 Pa). Airflows across the large openings in the model were found to be less than 
150 ft/min (0.75 m/s) at this low pressure differential. This is far less than the limiting airflow velocity of 
600 ft/min (3 m/s) needed to keep smoke from entering the shaft, discussed in Sec. 8.3.2. Therefore, 
smoke would be expected to enter the core and migrate to other areas of the building via the damaged 
shafts, albeit at a lesser rate than if no smoke management was provided. 
8.5 
SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS 
Five candidate smoke management system approaches were evaluated to determine whether each of these 
approaches could provide adequate pressurization to contain smoke to the zone of fire origin for five 
postulated fire scenarios. 
The smoke purge approach and the core pressurization approach were shown to create adequate pressure 
differentials for only the sprinklered fire scenario. Substantial negative pressure differentials, indicating 
flow of smoke from the zone of fire origin into the core, occurred for each of the other fire scenarios. 
The building pressurization approach created high pressure differentials from the core to the perimeter 
office spaces for all fire scenarios except the multi-floor September 11, 2001, aircraft impact scenarios. 
Positive pressures were demonstrated for both the undamaged core and shaft damage September 11 
scenarios in WTC 1, but sufficient airflow velocity was not created to prohibit smoke spread via large 
openings in ventilation shafts and in the core/office space boundaries resulting from aircraft impact 
damage. Use of the building pressurization method could potentially create excessive door opening forces 
that could hinder or prohibit the egress of building occupants.  The magnitude of the door opening forces 
is a function of the fire scenario, size of interior and exterior openings, and location of the floor(s) of fire 
origin relative to the location of the MER. 
The zoned smoke control with stair pressurization approach was shown to be effective for the sprinklered 
fire scenario, the full-floor burnout, and the two-floor fire. For each of these fire scenarios, however, stack 
effect was shown to have a substantial impact on the performance of the system, in some cases causing 
airflow from the floor of fire origin into the core.  Therefore, this approach might not be effective using a 
single speed fan, or set airflow quantity.  It is likely that fan speed would have to be adjusted based on 
differential pressure readings to ensure the success of a smoke management system using this approach. 
Because the zoned smoke control method involves exhausting from a single floor of the building, it was 
not effective for the multi-floor aircraft impact scenarios. In addition, stair pressurization did not prohibit 
smoke spread into the stairs when large openings in the stairway walls were present due to aircraft impact 
damage. 
The sandwich pressurization approach was determined to be effective for the sprinklered fire, full-floor 
burnout, and two-floor fire scenarios, even in the presence of stack effect. Positive pressures were 
demonstrated in the model scenarios for both the undamaged core and shaft damage September 11 
scenarios in WTC 1, but sufficient airflow velocity was not created to prohibit smoke spread via large 
openings into ventilation shafts or the core resulting from aircraft impact damage.

SUMMARY 
The objective of this effort was to evaluate the design, installation, and performance of the smoke 
management systems installed in World Trade Center (WTC) 1, 2, and 7.  The National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) documented the design and installation of the smoke management 
systems in WTC 1, 2, and 7 and compared the systems to requirements in applicable codes and standards. 
The effort also included the documentation of the normal operation of fully functional smoke 
management systems on smoke conditions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001. 
In order to complete Tasks 1 and 2, it was necessary to answer several questions to fully understand the 
potential impact of smoke management systems on the events occurring on September 11, 2001: 
• 
Were other smoke management system design approaches available for WTC 1 and WTC 2 
that might have had a substantial impact on smoke conditions in the buildings on 
September 11, 2001? 
• 
Is it reasonable to expect that an alternate smoke management system configuration could 
have been provided for WTC 1 and WTC 2 given the prevailing codes and standards and 
building practices in the United States? 
• 
What factors could have contributed to the success or failure of a smoke management system 
given the aircraft impact scenarios that occurred on September 11, 2001? 
9.1 
EVALUATION OF SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AVAILABLE ON 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
WTC 1 and WTC 2 were provided with a manual smoke purge system that was capable of exhausting 
smoke by quadrant for a multi-floor heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) zone. WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 were designed to meet the requirements contained in the 1968 Building Code of the City of New 
York (BCNYC). Changes were made to the buildings to meet the retroactive provisions of various local 
laws enacted subsequent to the time of building construction. Local Law No. 5, enacted in 1973, required 
retroactive provision of a smoke shaft for smoke venting or stair pressurization in high-rise building. 
Local Law No. 86, enacted in 1979, later omitted these requirements for existing buildings provided with 
automatic sprinklers throughout. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or Port 
Authority) initially investigated the provision of stair pressurization in a pilot study conducted in WTC 1 
over a period of time between 1976 and 1979. This approach was not implemented because a program for 
retrofitting the buildings with automatic sprinklers was adopted. WTC 1 and WTC 2 were also equipped 
with fire dampers in HVAC ductwork at the shaft walls on each floor. No requirement existed for 
retroactive provision of fire/smoke dampers in the buildings. 
Documentation of the sequence of operations pertaining to smoke purge in WTC 1 and WTC 2 differed in 
the available sources consulted in the preparation of this report. Building operations and maintenance

manuals, not updated since 1986, referred to a smoke purge mode as exhausting the HVAC zone 
containing the fire using the interior zone exhaust fans. No supply ventilation fans were referenced in the 
documented sequence. Port Authority personnel noted that the current sequence of operations in place on 
September 11, 2001, involved using both the interior supply and exhaust serving one of the four interior 
sub-zones to purge the zone of smoke. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) had the potential to 
utilize additional fans as they saw fit to respond to the conditions of a particular fire event. 
The smoke purge system for WTC 1 and WTC 2 were designed to be used for post-fire cleanup of smoke, 
although smoke purge was shown to have been used during a fire occurring in 1975 in WTC 1 during a 
fire event in an effort to control smoke spread. Smoke purge was initiated by the FDNY, but operated by 
building operations and maintenance personnel. 
From an examination of the available evidence, it was determined that the smoke management (smoke 
purge) systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 played no role in the events that occurred on September 11, 2001. 
No record was found of the smoke purge sequence being initiated in WTC 1 or WTC 2 by the FDNY or 
building operations and maintenance personnel. Had an attempt been made to initiate the smoke purge 
sequence it is unlikely the system would have functioned as designed, due to loss of electrical power 
and/or damage to the HVAC shafts and other structural elements in the impact zone. Even if the systems 
were in some way fully functional, they would not be capable of substantially reducing the extent of 
smoke spread through the building, as demonstrated by the analysis performed within this study. 
WTC 7 was provided with a zoned smoke management system that was capable of exhausting smoke 
manually on a floor-by-floor basis. Local Law No. 16 amended the 1968 BCNYC to require that all 
buildings in occupancy group E (business) be provided a manual override capable of exhausting one floor 
at a time at a rate of 6 air changes per hour, or 1 cfm/ft2, whichever is greater. For WTC 7, with a 
footprint area of approximately 48,000 ft2, this would require an exhaust capacity of at least 
48,000 ft3/min (81,552 m3/h). As documented in Chapter 4 of this report, the base building system serving 
the lower floors of the building provided a smoke exhaust capacity of 36,000 ft3/min (61,164 m3/h), which 
is not consistent with the minimum value specified by code. An 84,000 ft3/min (142,716 m3/h) exhaust 
fan was provided for the Salomon Smith Barney floors during the tenant retrofit. WTC 7 was sprinklered 
throughout and was therefore exempted from the requirement for stair pressurization systems.  The 
building was provided with a Class E fire alarm system per code and with emergency power serving all 
emergency systems, and was equipped throughout with fire dampers at duct penetrations into vertical 
shafts.

ALTERNATE MEANS OF SMOKE MANAGEMENT 
9.2.1 
Design Requirements in Prevailing Codes and Standards 
As discussed in Sec. 2.2, the earliest work pertaining to what we now would consider smoke management 
systems in buildings occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s, right around the time that WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 were being constructed. Design requirements for engineered smoke management systems matured 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of National Fire Protection Association 
(NFPA) 92A and 92B, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE) design texts, and updates to requirements in the model building codes in the United States. 
These advances in smoke management system design occurred well after the construction of WTC 1 and

WTC 2. As such, the definition of what was considered state-of-the-art smoke management system design 
changed over the life of the building. 
Various national and local building codes in the United States required provision of zoned smoke 
management systems in the 1980s and 1990s. Requirements predating the publication of NFPA 92A most 
often based the design on fixed air change rates such as six air changes per hour. After publication of 
NFPA 92A the codes most often based the design on provision of a specified pressure differential. 
Current codes, such as the International Building Code (IBC) and NFPA 5000 have removed the 
requirement of zoned smoke management for sprinklered high-rise buildings. The current codes are 
consistent with regard to the requirement of stair pressurization systems in high-rise buildings and 
combination fire/smoke dampers in HVAC system ductwork. 
9.2.2 
Past Recommendations for Changes to Smoke Management Systems 
Subsequent to the 1993 bombing, two separate studies were initiated by the Port Authority to examine the 
impact of smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2. The first study, performed by Rolf Jensen 
& Associates (RJA), modeled smoke movement through the buildings given the conditions at the time of 
the bombing. The study also examined the effects of stair venting, elevator hoistway venting, and stair 
pressurization on smoke spread through the buildings. The study concluded that of the approaches 
analyzed, stair pressurization had the potential to improve conditions for occupants exiting the building. 
However, the study concluded that the stair pressurization system design must consider the impact of 
stack effect, which greatly impacts the pressures obtained within the stairways.  The study also concluded 
that stair pressurization would have little to no effect when a large number of doorways were open into 
the stairways, as is the case during an event involving a building-wide evacuation.  There is no evidence 
indicating that provisions were made to provide stair pressurization in WTC 1 and WTC 2 as a result of 
the RJA study. 
The second study, performed in 1996 by Hughes Associates, Inc. (HAI) in conjunction with Dillon 
Consulting Engineers (DCE), examined the use of the existing building HVAC systems to accomplish 
smoke management in the buildings. Several major recommendations resulted from this study, including 
that smoke management systems be activated automatically using smoke detectors. The study specified 
use of a core pressurization approach, activated automatically by the detectors. The study further 
recommended manual alignment of the HVAC systems in a building pressurization mode in the event of a 
full-floor-burnout where flames were visible via broken windows on a fire floor. 
The recommendations for automatic initiation of smoke management from the 1996 study were not 
implemented in WTC 1 and WTC 2, as manual initiation of smoke management system was required in 
New York City. The sequence of operations for the existing manual smoke purge system was not updated 
to reflect use of a core pressurization approach. Procedures were not put in place for use of the building 
pressurization approach, as numerous decisions would have to be made that had the potential to create 
adverse door opening forces in the building. 
9.2.3 
Summary of Potential Changes 
New York City differs from many jurisdictions in the extent that new code provisions are retroactively 
enforced. Many provisions of the various local laws enacted since the 1968 BCNYC were retroactively 
Chapter 9

applied to existing high-rise buildings. Building codes typically do not retroactively apply requirements to 
retrofit existing buildings with smoke management systems. Retrofits of existing buildings are often 
difficult to achieve, and are costly to the building owners. WTC 1 and WTC 2 were retrofitted with 
automatic sprinkler systems, but no retrofit was done to provide additional smoke management systems 
for the buildings. Retrofit of WTC 1 and WTC 2 with stair pressurization and/or smoke dampers in 
HVAC ductwork would have been a substantial undertaking. Automatic initiation of smoke management 
systems was not implemented, as manual initiation of smoke management is the general practice in New 
York City. 
Based on the 1996 study, the Port Authority could have chosen to change the sequence of operations 
pertaining to the smoke purge to reflect use of a core pressurization approach.  This arrangement would 
have performed adequately for typical building fires if the system was used as an active fire protection 
system during a fire event.  However, such a change would have had little or no impact relative to the 
events that occurred on September 11, 2001. 
9.3 
EVALUATION OF SMOKE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE 
Based on the modeling of smoke management system performance for the candidate systems evaluated in 
this report, it can be concluded that smoke management systems would not have been effective in 
confining smoke to the zone of fire origin given the events of September 11, 2001. 
All of the candidate approaches evaluated failed to provide sufficient pressure differentials to confine 
smoke for the postulated September 11, 2001, building damage scenarios. Considering the fact that the 
availability of power was questionable due to impact damage, and that damage would have affected the 
intended pattern of air distribution within the zone of fire origin, successful system operation is even 
further in doubt. 
An assumption critical to the provision of smoke management systems designed to provide life safety 
protection for building occupants is that the system be operated automatically via approved automatic 
initiating devices, such as smoke detectors. Even if it was determined that a candidate smoke management 
system approach had the potential to provide adequate pressure differentials for a given fire scenario, 
substantial amounts of smoke could migrate through a building prior to activation of the system via 
manual means. This is particularly true for the extreme fire scenarios occurring as a result of the 
September 11, 2001, aircraft impacts. Manual operation of smoke management systems is specified by 
New York City regulations. 
On September 11, 2001, the aircraft impacts into both WTC 1 and WTC 2 affected floors that were 
entirely within only one ventilation zone, the 108th floor mechanical equipment room (MER) in WTC 1, 
and the 75th floor MER in WTC 2. If an aircraft were to have impacted the 91st/92nd floors, a large 
opening would have been created connecting two HVAC zones.  Operation of a smoke management 
system in this scenario could have adversely impacted conditions in the building, depending on the smoke 
management system approach used. Also, an aircraft impact directly onto an MER floor, such as the 
75th floor, could directly damage HVAC systems used for smoke management and cause smoke 
movement to all connected floors via the HVAC shafts. 
The prevailing national codes for new building construction in effect on September 11, 2001, specified 
the provision of stair pressurization systems and combination fire/smoke dampers in HVAC system

ductwork for new high-rise buildings equipped throughout with automatic sprinkler systems. No other 
active smoke management systems were required. Although the effectiveness of these measures was 
analyzed using the CONTAM model for the zoned smoke control with stair pressurization approach to 
determine if smoke containment via pressurization could be achieved, the modeling did not address 
whether provision of stair pressurization or smoke dampers could have improved smoke conditions within 
the buildings (i.e. tenability analysis). However, conclusions can be made with regard to the potential 
impact of these provisions in WTC 1 and WTC 2 on September 11, 2001, as discussed in the following 
sections. 
9.3.1 
Impact of Stair Pressurization Systems 
Provision of stair pressurization systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2 would have been difficult, due to the fact 
that the stairways extended 110 stories and changed location within the building at several locations via 
horizontal transfer corridors. 
It was shown in the RJA study that provision of stair pressurization systems would require pressure relief 
mechanisms within the stairs to relieve excessive overpressure conditions due to stack effect. The study 
further demonstrated that the effectiveness of stair pressurization was expected to be minimal when large 
numbers of doors were open, as would be the case in a full building evacuation scenario. The stair 
pressurization pilot study performed by the Port Authority in WTC 1 demonstrated that stair 
pressurization was achievable given a small number of doors open, but also demonstrated that excessive 
door opening forces were created under certain stack effect conditions during testing. 
During the events occurring on September 11, 2001, stair pressurization using typical existing design 
criteria would have been ineffective in improving conditions for occupants trying to exit the buildings. In 
the initial stages of the event, a full-building evacuation occurred from all floors that were not 
significantly affected by the aircraft impacts. This would have reduced the pressure differential within the 
stairs to the point where the required pressure differential was no longer achieved. 
In addition, substantial damage occurred to the stairway within the impact zone, causing smoke to migrate 
directly into the stairs. Stair pressurization is designed to prohibit smoke entry into a stairway. Supply air 
provided into the stair to achieve pressurization would be ineffective in diluting large amounts of smoke 
entering the stair. As with all HVAC systems in the building, it is unlikely that stair pressurization 
systems would have been fully operable on September 11, 2001, even if they had been installed, as 
damage to the building’s electrical and HVAC systems may have prevented proper operation of the 
systems. 
9.3.2 
Smoke Dampers 
As discussed in Chapter 7 of this report, significant smoke spread occurred within WTC 1 and WTC 2 via 
HVAC system ductwork. Combination fire/smoke dampers would likely have reduced the extent of 
smoke spread through the building by reducing smoke spread through damper openings on the upper 
floors of the building. Smoke dampers are generally powered open and are designed to fail closed upon 
loss of power. Thus, they would have been capable of closing despite a loss of electrical power. The 
primary effect of smoke damper operation would likely have been to slow the development of hazardous 
smoke conditions on the uppermost floors of the building.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
The following findings are based on the information and analysis documented in this report: 
• 
The smoke management systems in WTC 1 and WTC 2, which provided the capability for a 
manual smoke purge within an individual HVAC zone on a quadrant-by-quadrant basis, were 
not initiated on September 11, 2001. 
• 
Had the smoke purge sequence been initiated in WTC 1 or WTC 2, it is unlikely the system 
would have functioned as designed, due to loss of electrical power and/or damage to the 
HVAC shafts and other structural elements in the impact zone. 
• 
Provision of active smoke management systems and/or combination fire/smoke dampers was 
not required by the 1968 BCNYC or retroactive provisions in the various local laws enacted 
after WTC 1 and WTC 2 were constructed for existing high-rise buildings provided with 
automatic sprinklers throughout. 
• 
None of the potential smoke management system configurations evaluated in this report 
would have provided sufficient pressure differentials to contain smoke for the postulated 
aircraft impact damage scenarios, even if these systems were capable of operation after the 
building sustained damage from the aircraft impact. 
• 
The smoke purge sequence in existence on or before September 11, 2001, would have been 
expected to be capable of limiting the spread of smoke from the zone of fire origin only for 
fire scenarios in which the sprinkler system was operational and controlled the fire. Other 
smoke management strategies capable of being implemented using the existing WTC 1 and 
WTC 2 ventilation systems may also have been capable of controlling smoke from the 
postulated full-floor burnout and two-floor fire scenarios evaluated in this report had these 
strategies been identified and implemented in the sequence of operations. 
• 
During the events occurring on September 11, 2001, stair pressurization likely would have 
been ineffective in improving conditions for occupants trying to exit the building. 
• 
Installation of combination fire/smoke dampers in HVAC ductwork, which was not required 
in WTC 1 or WTC 2, would have acted to slow the development of hazardous conditions on 
the uppermost floors of the building, but would likely not have had a significant effect on the 
ability of occupants to egress the building due to the impassibility of the exit stairways.

NIST PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ESTIMATES 
The analysis of smoke management system performance on September 11, 2001, discussed in Chapter 7 
of this report, considered preliminary aircraft damage estimates dated October 27, 2003, developed under 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) World Trade Center (WTC) Investigation. 
This information was used to create the estimates of core damage summarized in Figs. 7–1 and 7–2. 
The preliminary damage estimates predate more current estimates that were not available at the time that 
the analyses of the smoke management system were performed.  The revised damage estimates are 
presented in NIST NCSTAR 1-2.  The damage estimated to have occurred to the drywall partitions within 
the building cores is of particular interest in the analyses of the smoke management systems, because the 
stair and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning shafts were made up of these types of partitions. The 
debris fields shown on the revised damage estimates were determined to indicate damage to vertical 
shafts to a similar degree shown on the preliminary damage estimates, for both WTC 1 and WTC 2. 
Therefore, the effects of implementing the revised estimates on the analyses of WTC 1 and WTC 2 would 
be minimal, as the preliminary and revised damage estimates were very similar with respect to vertical 
shaft damage.

Appendix B 
CONTAM MODEL CONSTRUCTION 
As discussed in Chapter 8 of this report, the CONTAM building airflow and contaminant dispersal model 
was used to evaluate the performance of candidate smoke management system approaches for various fire 
scenarios postulated for World Trade Center (WTC) 1 and 2. 
A model of WTC 1 was constructed using a baseline computer model created to support the analysis 
included in the 1996 Hughes Associates Incorporated (HAI)/Dillon Consulting Engineers (DCE) study. 
This model was utilized to evaluate scenarios in both WTC 1 and WTC 2 due to the similarity between 
the two buildings. Individual damage models were constructed simulating the effect of the aircraft 
impacts into the two buildings on September 11, 2001. 
Only WTC 1 was included in the model. Other buildings in the WTC complex were not modeled. As a 
result, simulations that evaluate the impact of stack effect on smoke management system performance do 
not consider the impact of the other buildings in the complex on the magnitude of the stack effect in a 
single tower or the position of the neutral plane in the building. 
This appendix summarizes the inputs included in the 1996 model, and the changes that were made to the 
model to perform the analysis included in this report. 
B.1 
1996 WTC CONTAM MODEL 
The 1996 WTC CONTAM model was used as a starting point for the construction of the 2004 WTC 
CONTAM model. The physical dimensions, geographical relationship of the spaces, airflow paths, and 
the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) setup used in the 1996 WTC CONTAM model are 
discussed in the 1996 study report (HAI and DCE 1996). 
The network model CONTAM 96 (Walton 1997), a DOS-based precursor to the CONTAC 2.0 model, 
was used to analyze the movement of smoke in the WTC complex. The CONTAM 96 model is an 
interactive network model designed for analyzing air movement and air quality in multi-zone buildings. 
The equations are derived from Bernoulli's equation for airflow and conservation equations for the spread 
of contaminants. Further discussion of the theory behind the CONTAM model is discussed in Chapter 8 
of this report. 
B.1.1 
CONTAM SketchPad and Building Zones 
CONTAM 96 and CONTAM 2.0 provide a SketchPad feature that can be used to establish the geometric 
relationships of building spaces and openings. The SketchPad is not intended to produce a scale drawing 
of the building, but rather to provide a spatial representation of the relative locations of zones and flow 
paths. Zones only need to be constructed in order to have the proper interconnections between them. The 
shape and size of the zones as drawn are not important. 
Appendix B 
 
Draft for Public Comment 
130 
NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
A zone, as defined in the CONTAM model, represents a volume of air with uniform temperature and 
contaminant concentration. Thus, individual geometric peculiarities are not important. Figure B–1 
provides an illustration of the 95th floor of WTC 1 and the corresponding CONTAM SketchPad 
representation of that floor, highlighting the major types of zones within the building including, Stairs 1 
through 3, local stairs, freight elevator 50, convenience stairs, local elevators, express elevators, HVAC 
shafts, and electrical closets. 
Because each tower has a large number of shafts and flow paths, it proved easiest to sketch the layout of 
each level by exaggerating the size of the shafts and other vertical openings, and shrinking the size of the 
tenant (interior) space, so that all flow elements could be shown on the SketchPad. This does not imply 
that any of the results are dependent on geometric features of the individual zones shown on the sketches. 
As far as the model is concerned, results will be identical for flow into a long corridor or square room, as 
long as the zone volume and temperature and other openings into the zone remain constant. 
One hundred and sixteen levels were used in the construction of the tower model, including levels B–6 
through floor 110. The base model contained more than 3,200 discrete zones and more than 14,000 flow 
paths between various zones. Each zone is given a zone name that, when tied to the floor level, gives it a 
discrete identification from every other zone in the model. A naming convention was used to facilitate 
record keeping, and is shown in Table B–1.

A number of smaller openings were also included in the model. These consisted of elevators, stairs, doors, 
walls, and floor leakages. Both elevators and stairs were modeled as ASCOS openings, governed by 
equation 1. Flow though smaller leakage areas was modeled using the power law equation:

In order for CONTAM to calculate flow through an opening using the “leakage area” approach, a flow

opening type. For different types of openings, the values listed in Table B–2 were used.

Entrances to openings can be characterized as intruding, flush, or well-rounded inlets. Exits can be 
characterized in the same manner. Entrance conditions can be characterized as either plenum or pipe-
flow, self-generated eddies caused by stagnation or separation can occur based on the angle of attack of 
the airflow. Virtually all of the opening areas in the WTC complex can be reasonably approximated by 
use of an orifice discharge coefficient, CD, equal to 0.65. This coefficient is well documented and 
applicable to virtually all of the flow conditions where the Reynolds number, Re, is fully turbulent, i.e., 
greater than 10,000. 
Some of the very large areas with very low velocities are not well characterized by this same CD. In these 
instances, it is more appropriate to use values observed by F.C. Lea (Lea 1942) and those of Newell. 
These two works lead to the conclusion that for these conditions a number lying between 0.74 and 0.91 is 
more appropriate. Given that the experimental data reported has a spread of nearly 15 percent, the value 
of 0.82 was selected for CD to characterize these openings. The parameters for the various leakage paths 
in the model are shown in Table B–2. Leakage areas for the various doors in the model are shown in

1996 CONTAM HVAC System 
Air handling systems in the 1996 CONTAM model were simulated by using CONTAM’s Simple Air 
Handling System feature. A simple air handling system consists of two implicit airflow nodes (supply and 
return), three implicit flow paths (recirculation, outdoor, and exhaust air), and multiple supply and return 
points, each with specified airflows, in the building zones. Outside air supply to a system is set either by 
definition, as a fixed percentage, by profile, or by calculation. If the sum of supply flows exceeds the sum 
of return flows, the balance is made up from outside air. Excess return flow is exhausted. The model does 
not require that both supply and return points be defined for a system. 
To facilitate the various scenarios and cases that were simulated, four simple air handling systems were 
constructed for each HVAC zone in the tower: Interior space supply, interior space return, core supply, 
and core return.  (The perimeter and interior systems were combined into a single system in the model).  
Additional systems were constructed for the elevator machine room (EMR) exhausts, the mechanical 
equipment room (MER) exhausts, the sub-grade transfer fans, and the garage and truck dock systems. 
Supply and return points for each system were added to the appropriate zones in the model. The flow for 
each point was derived from a careful study of the HVAC plans for the building. The fan schedules and 
riser diagrams were reviewed, and the supply and return flow for each zone was determined. To simulate 
actual operating efficiency (based on building engineer estimates), the simulations were conducted using

1996 Site Survey and Physical Testing 
As part of the 1996 study, a site survey and physical testing of the WTC complex was conducted. The site 
survey was performed on June 28–July 2, 1996 with a follow up visit on July 23, 1996. The physical 
testing was conducted on June 30, between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Temperatures early in the morning 
were nominally 60 °F ± 5 °F, and the wind was fairly constant at 2 mph (HAI and DCE 1996). The 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported a New York City temperature range of 
60 °F–75 °F on June 30, 1996. 
The purpose of the testing that was conducted was to determine the performance of the building’s air 
movement pathways as well as the various barriers to air movement. Pressure measurements were taken 
at various locations through the building under various HVAC modes. The HVAC modes included: 
• 
Mode 1—All fans on 
• 
Mode 2—Fans set on summer normal

• 
Mode 3—Fans set for core pressurization for the full height of WTC 1 
• 
Mode 4—Floors 59 through 91 set on core pressurization and all other floors set on 
100 percent purge 
Site survey pressure measurement results, for HVAC Modes 1 through 4, are listed in Tables B–5 
through B–8. 
Measurements of the leakage areas of several types of door assemblies were also taken during the site 
survey. Survey measurements are presented in two tables: 
1. Table B–9 is the raw data recorded during the site survey. 
2. Table B–10 is the adjusted data with outlying measurements discarded. 
Table B–11 lists the adjusted average leakage areas proposed to be used for the various types of leakage 
paths by the 1996 HAI/DCE study (HAI and DCE 1996).

1996 WTC CONTAM Model Calibration 
The pressure measurements obtained during the site survey were used to validate the 1996 WTC 
CONTAM model. In order to fine tune the model, the leakage path areas for stair doors, passenger 
elevators, and selected other doors were increased. These increases lumped together as part of the stair 
and elevator door openings other construction leakages that may have existed, such as penetrations in 
elevator/stair shaft walls. Therefore, the leakage areas used may appear higher than that typically 
associated with stair doors or elevator doors. The corrected leakage path areas used in the 1996 WTC 
CONTAM model are listed in Table B–11. 
B.2 
2004 WTC CONTAM MODEL 
The construction process of the 2004 WTC CONTAM model was guided by efforts to provide a better 
calibration of the model to the actual pressure measurements taken within the building. Details of this 
calibration process are discussed in Appendix C. The following section outlines the final version(s) of the 
2004 WTC CONTAM model, including aircraft impact damage models for WTC 1 and WTC 2.

B.2.1 
Leakage Areas 
The leakage areas used in the 2004 WTC CONTAM model for the various building construction elements 
and their associated tightness classification are listed in Table B–12, for model configurations A/B and C. 
As is discussed in Appendix C, there were several potential building configurations, representing 
combinations of assumed leakages and ventilation system parameters that provide relatively good 
agreement with the calibration data. 
Configuration A represents a best approximation of the various leakages and ventilation system 
parameters that existed in the towers on September 11, 2001. Configuration B uses the same leakage areas 
assumed for configuration A. The only difference between model configurations A and B is that 
configuration A assumes 85 percent fan efficiency, while configuration B assumes 60 percent fan 
efficiency. Tightness classifications are based on typical leakage area measurements of walls and floors in 
commercial buildings (see Table B–12) (Klote and Milke 2002). 
Several architectural features were added to the 2004 WTC CONTAM model. Wall transfers grills, which 
were observed during the 1996 site survey, were added to the model. A perimeter leakage was added, 
intended to model floor slab penetrations for the high-pressure perimeter air system, discussed in 
Chapter 4. Given the building’s approximate 800 ft perimeter, a perimeter leakage of 8 ft2 and 16 ft2 
correlates to a 1/8 in. and 1/4 in. perimeter gap respectively.

Key:  NA, not applicable. 
In the 1996 CONTAM model only one wall leakage type was used, termed “interior wall.” Variations in 
wall leakage were taken into account by lumping extra leakage area into stair and elevator leakage paths. 
This methodology presents problems in trying to keep track of the effect of the various leakage 
parameters used. 
The 2004 CONTAM model added several new leakage path types to provide unique leakage paths for the 
various interior wall types (stairs, elevators, tenant/core separations). Leakage areas for doors (elevator, 
stair, tenant) were reset to correspond to the actual measured values, as shown in Table B–11.

B.2.2 
2004 CONTAM HVAC System 
The basic framework of the HVAC modeling approach used in the 1996 WTC CONTAM model 
(discussed in Sec. B.1.3) remained the same for the 2004 WTC CONTAM model. However, several 
additions were made in the 2004 model, which had a sizeable impact on simulated pressures. The 
additions to the 1996 HVAC modeling approach included: 
• 
Added schedules to the vertical shaft openings, which allowed the user to easily open and 
close the shafts when necessary. When both supply and exhaust fans are turned off, the 
ventilation shafts are modeled open in CONTAM. This is done to model the passive pathway 
created when no air is being mechanically driven within the ventilation ducts. Conversely, 
when both supply and exhaust fans are turned on, as in the case of summer normal mode, 
ventilation shafts are modeled closed. This is done to model the mechanically driven air, 
which eliminates the passive pathway for air transport via the ventilation ducts. 
• 
Dampers were added to core and tenant ventilation shafts. Damper dimensions were taken 
from WTC mechanical riser diagrams. 
• 
Outdoor air louvers, connected to each ventilation unit/shaft, where added on each MER 
level.  Modeling the outdoor air louvers provided additional pressure relief to the building. 
Outdoor air louver dimensions were taken from WTC mechanical riser diagrams. 
In the 2004 WTC CONTAM model, configurations A and C assume that air is supplied and returned at 
85 percent of listed capacities, while configuration B assumes that air is supplied and returned at 
60 percent of listed capacities (see Tables B–4a through B–4e for details). It is important to note that in all 
three configurations (A–C) the ratio between supply and return air remains constant (as listed in 
Tables B–4a through B.4e). The ratio between supply and return air can have a substantial effect on 
building pressures. 
Zoned Smoke Control With Stair Pressurization 
As discussed in Sec. 8.1.5 of this report, the state of the art smoke management approach referred to as 
“Zoned Smoke Control With Stair Pressurization” was analyzed. This smoke management approach 
consisted of pressurizing Stairs 1–3, while exhausting air within the tenant (interior) space on the fire 
floor. Theoretical fans sizes for stair pressurization and tenant space exhaust were determined based on 
providing 0.05 in. H2O across the stair and tenant doors under the following HVAC configuration: 
• 
Supply and exhaust fans are turned off in the multi-floor ventilation zone containing the fire. 
For example, if a fire occurs on the 80th floor (served by MER 75), interior and core (supply 
and exhaust) fans on floors 59 through 91 are turned off. As previously discussed, when both 
supply and exhaust fans are turned off (within a ventilation zone), the ventilation shafts are 
modeled open in CONTAM. This is done to model the passive pathway created when no air 
is being mechanically driven within the ventilation ducts. 
• 
Supply and exhaust fans in ventilation zones not containing the fire are set to summer normal 
mode. In summer normal mode, both supply and exhaust fans are running and therefore a 
passive pathway for air movement is eliminated. Under summer normal mode, ventilation

153 
shafts are modeled in CONTAM as being closed to address the mechanically driven air 
within the ventilation ducts. 
• 
Class-II smoke dampers activate in the multi-floor ventilation zone containing the fire, as 
smoke dampers would typically be provided in a state-of-the-art smoke management system. 
Class-II leakage rated smoke dampers (UL 555S) were modeled in CONTAM by multiplying 
the flow area of each ventilation shaft damper by a leakage area ratio of 0.6 in.2/ft2 (Klote and 
Milke 2002). 
Some smoke control designers limit the height of single-injection stairways to 8 stories; however, other 
designers feel this limit can be extended to 12 stories (Klote and Milke 2002).  Given the height of the 
WTC stairways (40 or more stories within each stair section), a multiple-injection point system was used. 
A multi injection point stair pressurization system was modeled in CONTAM using the Simple Air 
Handling System feature.  Supply (injection) points were placed approximately five stories apart within 
each stairway.  CONTAM schedules were added to each supply point, which allowed the user to adjust 
the amount of air supplied to each stair section.  Stair sections were determined by the location of the 
horizontal transfer corridors. 
Stair 1 and Stair 2 consists of three sections: 
• 
Section 1: Floors 2 through 42 
• 
Section 2: Floors 43 through 75 
• 
Section 3: Floors 75 to Roof 
Stair 3 consists of two sections: 
• 
Section 1: Floors 1 through 75 
• 
Section 2: Floors 75 through 107 
Through an iterative simulation process using CONTAM, the stair pressurization fan size required to 
achieve 0.05 in. H2O across the stair doors for each stair section was determined.  Stair pressurization fan 
sizes were determined for both model configurations A/B and C (as discussed in Sec. 8.3.3).  Model 
configurations A and B assumed identical leakage areas for the various building construction elements 
and therefore the stair pressurization fan sizes required were the same.  Modeling results for the stair 
pressurization fan sizes required to achieve 0.05 in. H2O across stair doors are shown in Table B–13.  The 
listed fan capacities in Table B–13 assume that all stair doors, stair transition doors, elevator doors, and 
tenant doors were closed.

DAMAGED WTC CONTAM MODELS 
A “damaged” CONTAM model, for both WTC 1 and WTC 2, was developed from the 2004 WTC 
baseline CONTAM model (discussed in Sec. B.2). The damaged models reflect the aircraft impact 
damage to a tower’s exterior walls, concrete floor slabs, core walls, and shafts (elevator and stairs) due to 
the events on September 11, 2001. 
For the damaged models, a northerly wind was modeled in CONTAM at a velocity of 11.2 mph (5 m/s) 
and a direction of 328 degrees, depicting wind conditions on September 11, 2001. In the CONTAM 
model, the wall azimuth angle (reference point) for the top wall on the SketchPad is defined as 0 degrees. 
A 0 degree wind modeled in CONTAM would be directly perpendicular to the north face of WTC 1. As 
shown in Fig. B–2, a northerly wind is approximately 32 degrees off the perpendicular, equaling a wind 
direction of 328 degrees. The outside temperature was modeled in CONTAM as 70 °F, depicting 
temperature conditions on September 11.

The top of the CONTAM SketchPad represents the north face of the building; where as the bottom of the 
SketchPad represents the south face of the building. The impact damage to each exterior face of the 
building, discussed below, was modeled accordingly. This was to done to ensure that the effects of a 
northerly wind across the large exterior (damage) openings were modeled properly. 
Table B–15 shows the estimated impacted damage to the exterior walls of WTC 1. The impact damage 
was added in CONTAM to the external walls as two-way flow openings. The estimated impacted damage 
to exterior walls is based on the World Trade Center Building Performance Study performed by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (McAllister 2002).

Damaged WTC 2 CONTAM Model 
Similar to the damaged WTC 1 model, the damaged WTC 2 model considers the north face of the 
building as the top of the SketchPad. The impact damage to each exterior face of the building, discussed 
below, was modeled accordingly. This was to done to ensure the effects of a northerly wind across the 
large exterior (damage) openings were modeled properly for the different orientations of WTC 1 and 
WTC 2. It should be noted, however, that the WTC 2 model does not consider the impact of WTC 1 on

wind driven flow around the building, which is important since WTC 1 was directly in the path of the 
prevailing wind on September 11, 2001. 
The impact damage to the core walls of WTC 2 were rotated by 90 degrees with respect to WTC 1 (see 
Fig. B–3). This was done to correctly account for the different core orientation in WTC 2 versus WTC 1 
with respect to the point of aircraft impact. Since the CONTAM model considers the interior office space 
as one large open zone, the core can be effectively rotated by placing damage openings in the proper 
locations, rather than physically rotating the location of the core zones on the CONTAM SketchPad.

CONTAM MODEL CALIBRATION 
As part of the 1996 Hughes Associates Incorporated (HAI)/Dillon Consulting Engineers (DCE) study, 
measurements were made of actual airflows and pressures at various locations in World Trade Center 
(WTC) 1 for different ventilation modes. At the time, a limited model calibration was performed in order 
to perform the analysis in the 1996 study. 
To complete the modeling summarized in this report, many changes were made to the model (summarized 
in Appendix B) to add building features not present in the 1996 model and to add additional leakage path 
types to provide additional degrees of freedom in performing the simulations. As such, it was desired to 
revisit the calibration of the model in order to attempt to provide better agreement between the model and 
the measured data. 
This appendix discusses the efforts that went into the recalibration of the model, and the relative 
agreement between the actual WTC pressure measurements (see Tables B–2 through B–5) and pressures 
simulated using the 2004 WTC CONTAM model. Calibration efforts were conducted for the four 
different ventilation modes (Modes 1 through 4), discussed in Appendix B.1.4. 
C.1 
PRE-CALIBRATION EFFORTS 
The 2004 WTC CONTAM model was constructed using the 1996 WTC CONTAM model as a starting 
point. Changes were made to the model to add building features that were identified as missing from the 
1996 model and to reflect lessons learned over the intervening years with regard to the use of CONTAM 
to model the performance of smoke management systems in high-rise buildings. This knowledge was 
applied to the calibration process and construction of the 2004 WTC model. 
The first step in the 2004 WTC CONTAM model construction involved setting all of the corrected door 
leakage areas used in 1996 model back to the values measured during the 1996 WTC site visit. Measured 
door leakage areas are given in Appendix B, Table B–11. Since the door leakage values (core, elevator, 
and stair doors) reflect actual measured values, these leakages remained fixed during the calibration 
process. 
The leakage areas of several key construction elements were not included as individual elements during 
the 1996 study and therefore needed to be estimated. The non-measured construction elements included: 
• 
Exterior walls 
• 
Stair walls 
• 
Elevator walls 
• 
Floors

Leakage area estimates for these construction elements were kept within the bounds of tightness typically 
observed in commercial buildings (Klote and Milke 2002).  Typical leakage areas of walls and floors of 
commercial buildings are listed in Table C–1.

a. For the stairway and elevator shaft walls, the leakage area ratio is the area of the leakage through the 
wall per linear ft based on a 12 ft slab-to-slab height. 
Measurements made by Tamura and Shaw (Klote and Milke 2002) show stairway walls to be 
approximately one order of magnitude tighter than elevator shaft walls (see Table C–1 for details).  In the 
1996 WTC CONTAM model, elevator shaft walls and stairway walls were combined together as one 
building construction element for simplicity. In the 2004 WTC CONTAM model, elevator shafts and 
stairway walls were modeled as two separate construction elements (airflow elements), to account for 
their considerable difference in tightness. This allowed the modeler to independently vary the leakage 
areas for the elevator shaft walls and stairway walls. 
C.2 
CALIBRATION EFFORTS 
Initial calibration efforts involved matching simulated data with measured data under Mode 2, where all 
fans are set to summer normal. The heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system within 
CONTAM was set up to depict ventilation Mode 2, where all fans were running at 85 percent of design 
capacity. Using an iterative process, leakage areas for the non-measured construction elements were 
varied until simulated results were in reasonable agreement with measured values. Under Mode 2, 
simulated results showed the best agreement with measured values when: 
• 
Exterior walls were set to tight 
• 
Elevator shaft wall were set to tight

• 
Stairway walls were set to average 
• 
Floors were set to tight 
This tightness configuration for the non-measured construction elements also produced a reasonable 
agreement under Mode 1. 
The iterative process also involved varying outside temperature and wind velocities. CONTAM 
simulations, running under Mode 2, showed that outside temperature differences of up to 10 °F and wind 
velocity variation of up to 20 mph produced relatively small changes in simulated pressures, as illustrated 
in Figs. C–21 through C–30. Mode 1 was calibrated using an outside temperature of 63 °F and Modes 2 
through 4 were calibrated using an outside temperature of 70 °F. The temperatures used were based on 
measurements made during the site survey (see Sec. B.1.4) and the sequence in which the four different 
HVAC modes were conducted, as outside temperature would have risen during the day from the early 
morning to late morning period in which the pressure tests were performed. 
The next calibration step involved testing the tightness configuration that produced a reasonable 
agreement under Modes 1 and 2, for Modes 3 and 4. When the CONTAM model was set up for Mode 3 
(core pressurization for the full height of the tower), using the tightness configuration used to match 
Modes 1 and 2, the model simulations produced very high positive pressures across the tenant doors. 
Simulated pressures across the tenant door were greater than 1.0 in. H2O. These high pressures across the 
tenant doors would have been apparent during the site survey, because the doors would have been pinned 
shut due to the substantial overpressure. In actuality, under the core pressurization configuration (Modes 3 
and 4), positive pressures were measured between 0.01 in. H2O and 0.05 in. H2O (see Tables B–5 through 
B–8). 
At this point in the calibration process the results showed that the 2004 CONTAM model agreed 
reasonably well with Modes 1 and 2, but not with Modes 3 and 4. Because this study involved analyzing 
the effectiveness of various smoke management approaches, including the core pressurization mode, 
Modes 3 and 4 were used to calibrate the final version(s) of the 2004 WTC CONTAM model. Principally, 
the positive pressures measured across the tenant doors and elevator 50 during core pressurization 
(Modes 3 and 4) were used to calibrate the final version(s) of the 2004 WTC CONTAM model. 
C.2.1 
Architectural and Mechanical Building Features Added 
The initial simulation results for Modes 3 and 4 warranted further investigation into the building’s 
architecture and HVAC system. Investigation of the building’s ventilation system led to modeling shaft 
dampers and mechanical equipment room (MER) outdoor air louvers located in WTC 1. This 
modification dramatically reduced pressures across the tenant doors in Modes 3 and 4, by adding 
additional pressure relief from the core and interior space to the exterior of the building. Investigation of 
the building’s architecture lead to modeling the wall transfer grills located over many of the tenant doors, 
providing an additional airflow path between the core and interior space. Leakage around the perimeter of 
the tenant space due to ventilation penetrations for the high-pressure air was also modeled in CONTAM. 
As stated in Appendix B, perimeter gaps of 1/8 in. and 1/4 in. correlate to total perimeter leakages of 8 ft2 
and 16 ft2, respectively, given the approximate 800 ft perimeter of the building.

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
After the architectural and mechanical building features described above were added to the 2004 WTC 
model, leakage values for the non-measured construction elements were set based on the construction 
characteristics of each element. The construction characteristics of each element are as follows: 
• 
Floors—Floor construction typically consisted of 4 in. of lightweight concrete on 1 1/2 in., 
22 gauge non-composite steel deck (McAllister 2002). In the core area, slab thickness was 
5 in. Based on this construction, the floor leakage was set and held at “tight” 
(0.00095 in.2/ft2). 
• 
Exterior Walls—Construction of the building’s exterior walls consisted of closely spaced 
built-up box columns. A total of 59 perimeter columns were present along each flat face of 
the building. The columns were built up by welding four plates together to form an 
approximately 14 in. spare section, spaced at 3-4 in. on center. This column spacing resulted 
in relatively small window sizes, approximately 2 ft wide. Based on this construction, leakage 
areas for the exterior wall were set between “average” (0.03 in.2/ft2) and “tight” (0.01 in.2/ft2). 
• 
Elevator Shaft Walls—Elevator shaft walls were constructed of taped drywall. Using drywall 
greatly reduced the natural weight load of the building. Based on this construction, leakage 
areas were set between “average” (1.45 in.2/ft) and “loose” (3.11 in.2/ft). 
• 
Stairway Walls—Stairway walls were constructed of taped drywall. Using drywall greatly 
reduced the natural weigh load of the building. Stairway walls contained various types of 
penetrations, adding leakage. Based on this construction, leakage areas were set between 
“loose” (0.6 in.2/ft) and “very loose” (1.0 in.2/ft). 
C.2.2 
Model Configurations 
Three different model configurations were used in order to represent the uncertainty involved with this 
type of modeling. These three model configurations attempt to bracket the estimated leakage rates for the 
various building construction elements, as well as the efficiency of the HVAC system. The model 
configurations include: 
• 
Configuration A—This model configuration is based on best estimates of building variables. 
The HVAC efficiency is set at 85 percent based on WTC building engineer estimates (HAI 
and DCE 1996). Door leakage areas are set to measured leakage values (Appendix B, 
Table B–11). Non-measured building construction elements are set to expected leakage 
values based on the construction type of each element, as discussed in Sec. C.2.1. A complete 
summary of leakage areas for this configuration is given in Appendix B, 
Table B–12. 
• 
Configuration B—Same leakage areas as configuration A. This model configuration reduces 
the HVAC efficiency from 85 to 60 percent, and results in an overall reduction of pressure 
within the building. 
• 
Configuration C—This model configuration increases the leakage areas (i.e., loosens) of 
configuration A. The HVAC efficiency is held at 85 percent. A complete summary of leakage 
areas for this configuration is given in Appendix B, Table B–12.

NIST NCSTAR 1-4D, WTC Investigation 
For Mode 1, the 2004 WTC CONTAM model agreed fairly well with measured pressures. Maximum 
stairs pressure agreed by a factor of 1.7, elevator 50 by 2.5, shuttle and freight elevators by 1.2, local 
elevators by 1.4, and tenant doors by 2.5. Tenant doors agreement factors are high because simulated 
pressures were very close to zero. 
For Mode 2, the 2004 WTC CONTAM model agreed poorly with measured pressures. Simulated 
agreement factors were between 3.1 and 85.7. These agreement factors are high because simulated 
pressures were close to zero. Simulated pressure in Mode 2 is close to zero for two main reasons: 
1. Non-measured building construction elements were loosened to better match Modes 3 and 4. 
2. The ventilation system modeled assumed a relative air balance between the supply and return 
air. 
Supply and return air rates were modeled based on mechanical drawings, as shown in Tables B–4a 
through B–4e, and not on actual measured ventilation rates. Tenant changes on individual floors to the 
ventilation system were not known nor modeled. As shown Tables B–6 and B–8, relatively high negative 
pressures were measured on floors 29 and 92 under Modes 2 and 4. Mode 4 is similar to Mode 2 on 
floors 29 and 92 in that the ventilation is set to summer normal.  The pressures measured on floor 29 and 
92 are over an order of magnitude greater than the other measured floors.  These abnormally high 
pressures may be attributed to tenant changes to the ventilation system on these floors (or neighboring 
floors). Tenant changes to the ventilation system on an individual floor would not only alter the pressures 
on that floor, but could alter the entire network of pressures within the WTC complex. These abnormally 
high pressures may also be attributed to unique architectures on these floor or neighboring floors, as 
discussed in Sec. C.2.3. It should be noted that in many cases, the floors directly above/below floors 29 
and 92 had fairly good agreement with measured data for these floors, indicating that pressures were in 
the correct range for that area of the building. 
For Mode 3, the 2004 WTC CONTAM model agreed reasonably well with measured pressures. 
Maximum stair pressures agreed by a factor of 2.1, elevator 50 by 1.0, shuttle and freight elevators by 3.2, 
local elevators by 1.0, and tenant doors by 1.7. As previously discussed, calibration of the 2004 WTC 
CONTAM model depended heavily on the positive pressures measured during the site survey across the 
tenant doors and elevator 50, under Modes 3 and 4 (core pressurization). These principal measured 
pressures are highlighted in Table C–1. As shown in Table C–1, simulated pressures agree very well with 
the principal measured pressures across the tenant doors and elevator 50. 
For Mode 4, the 2004 WTC CONTAM model agreed reasonably well with measured pressures. 
Maximum stair pressures agreed by a factor of 1.1, elevator 50 by 1.0, shuttle and freight elevators by 2.5, 
local elevators by 1.3, and tenant doors by 1.1. 
C.3.2 
Simulated Results for Modes 1 through 4 
The simulation results for model configurations A through C under HVAC Modes 1 through 4 are shown 
in Tables C–2 through C–12. The measured data is summarized in Tables B–5 through B–8 (Appendix B) 
as well as the calibration measurements taken during the 1996 HAI/DCE study. The figures discussed in 
Sec. C.3.3 provide a comparison between the two sets of data.

C.3.3 
Comparison of Results–Measured versus Predicted 
Graphical comparisons between measured and predicted pressure differentials, for HVAC Modes 1 
through 4, are shown in Figs. C–1 through C–20. When considering these figures it would appear that in 
some cases the agreement between measured and predicted values appears quite good and in some cases 
measured and predicted values vary substantially. Since measured pressures were often in the range of 
0.01 in. H2O to 0.2 in. H2O, the overall agreement between measured and predicted values was good, off 
by a factor of 1–2 rather than an order of magnitude. Differences between measured and predicted values 
are due to uncertainties and simplifications in the model, as discussed in Sec. C.3.4.

C.3.4 
Affect of Temperature Variation 
As discussed in Appendix B (Sec. B.1.4), testing of Modes 1 through 4 conducted in support of the 
1996 HAI/DCE study took place on June 30, 1996, between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. The National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported a temperature range of 60 °F to 75 °F on this date. 
Since the 1996 study does not document when during the stated time period each test was performed, it is 
unclear what the temperature was during each test. This had the potential to impact predicted pressure 
differentials due to the impact of stack effect. As seen in Figs. C–21 through C–25, predicted pressure 
differentials varied only slightly over a wide range of assumed temperatures. Therefore, Mode 1 was 
calibrated using an outside temperature of 60 °F since it was assumed that this test would have logically 
been run first, during the early morning period. Modes 2 through 4 were calculated assuming an outside 
air temperature of 70 °F.

Affects of Wind Velocity 
As discussed in Appendix B (Sec. B.1.4), the 1996 HAI/DCE reported that during the testing performed 
using Modes 1 through 4, wind was fairly constant at 2 mph. In Figs. C–26 through C–30, wind was 
varied between 0 mph and 20 mph to test whether variation in wind conditions would affect the 
calibration of the model. As seen in these figures, wind had no notable effect on the predicted pressure 
differentials, and was therefore not considered in the calibration of the model.

C.4 
FACTORS AFFECTING CALIBRATION 
There are a number of factors or combinations of factors which may help explain disagreement between 
the measured pressures and simulated pressure including: 
• 
Pressure gauge accuracy and user error 
• 
Actual outdoor temperature as a function of height was not known. The outdoor temperature 
in CONTAM is assumed to be uniform across the exterior face of the building 
• 
Architectural changes to individual floors that may substantially alter pressure differentials at 
individual points. Potential changes include 
− 
Number of tenant doors located between core and interior space 
− 
Number and size of wall transfer grills 
− 
Configuration of tenant doors (i.e., open, partially open, closed) 
− 
Presences of convenience stairs 
− 
Configuration of stair doors (i.e., open, partially open, closed) 
− 
Configuration of stair transition doors (i.e., open, partially open, closed). 
− 
Configuration of elevator doors (i.e., open, partially open, closed) 
CONTAM simulations assumed all stair doors, stair transition doors, tenant doors, and 
elevator doors over the entire height of the building, were completely closed. CONTAM 
simulations assumed the number of tenant doors remained consistent on each floor. 
CONTAM simulations also assumed the number and size of wall transfer grills remained 
consistent on each floor. Additional factors that may have contributed to variations 
between simulated and measured pressure are discussed in Section C.2.3. 
• 
Tenant changes on individual floors to architecture and/or ventilation system. 
• 
Actual supply and return rates on each floor were not measured. Simulations show that the 
rate of air being supplied and returned, and more importantly the ratio between them, will 
have a dramatic effects build pressures. 
• 
Instructions given to building engineers to set various HVAC modes may have been 
misinterpreted. For example, when a “purge” command was given, building engineers may 
have aligned equipment differently than what was assumed. Small fans not thought to impact 
the sequence may have been inadvertently left on, affecting overall pressure differentials. 
C.5 
CALIBRATION SUMMARY 
During the calibration of the 2004 CONTAM model there were too many independent variables (leakage 
types, wind/weather conditions, HVAC system alignments, design versus measured supply/return airflow,

unknown architectural changes to individual floor plans) to allow for a single model configuration that 
matched all of the data for the various ventilation modes tested. 
It was therefore determined that in order to capture the uncertainty involved in the type of modeling being 
performed, and the potential range of results given this uncertainty that the three separate building 
configurations discussed in this appendix (configurations A, B, and C) would be carried forth in the 
modeling performed for this report.
