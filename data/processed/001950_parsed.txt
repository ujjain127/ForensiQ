CHAIRMEN OF SENATE STANDING COMMITTEES 
 
[Table 5-3] 
1789 - present 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The following is a list of chairmen of all standing Senate committees, as well as the 
chairmen of select and joint committees which precursors to Senate committees.  The names of 
chairmen were taken from the Congressional Directory from 1816-1991.  Four standing 
committees were founded before 1816.  They were the Joint Committee on ENROLLED 
BILLS (established 1789), the joint Committee on the LIBRARY (established 1806), the 
Committee to AUDIT AND CONTROL THE CONTINGENT EXPENSES OF THE 
SENATE (established 1807), and the Committee on ENGROSSED BILLS (established 1810.)  
The names of the chairmen of these committees for the years before 1816 were taken from the 
Annals of Congress. 
 
 
 
This list also enumerates the dates of establishment and termination of each committee.  
These dates were taken from Walter Stubbs, Congressional Committees, 1789-1982:  A Checklist 
(Westport, CT:  Greenwood Press, 1985).  There were eleven committees for which the dates of 
existence listed in Congressional Committees, 1789-1982 did not match the dates the committees 
were listed in the Congressional Directory.  The committees are:  ENGROSSED BILLS, 
ENROLLED BILLS, EXAMINE THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL 
SERVICE, Joint Committee on the LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, LIBRARY, PENSIONS, 
PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS, RETRENCHMENT, REVOLUTIONARY 
CLAIMS, ROADS AND CANALS, and the Select Committee to Revise the RULES of the 
Senate.  For these committees, the dates are listed according to Congressional Committees, 1789-
1982, with a note next to the dates detailing the discrepancy.

     18At the beginning of the 107th Congress in January 2001 the Senate was evenly divided. With a 
Democratic president and vice president still serving until January 20, the Democratic vice president was 
available to break a tie, and the Democrats thus controlled the Senate for 17 days, from January 3 to 
January 20. On January 3 the Senate adopted S. Res. 7 designating Democratic senators as committee 
chairmen to serve during this period and Republican chairmen to serve effective at noon on January 20, 
2001. 
     19 On June 6, 2001, the Democrats took control of the Senate after Senator James Jeffords (VT) 
changed from the Republican party to Independent and announced that he would caucus with the 
Democrats.
