Proxy Signature
In 1996, Mambo et al. ﬁrst invented the notion of proxy
signature [1], in which the original signer can delegate his
signature power to any reliable person called proxy signer
when he is on vacation.
Lee et al. [2] drew a conclusion in their paper that a secure
proxy signature scheme must satisfy the following
properties:Strong Unforgeability, Veriﬁability, Strong
Identiﬁability, Strong Undeniability, Prevention of Misuse.
Boldyreva, A. Palacio and B. Warinschi gave the formal
notion and security model of proxy signature in [4], and the
proxy signature schemes have provable-security
guarantees;

Proxy Cryptographsystem
In 1997 Mambo et al. introduced the proxy cryptosystem (proxy
decryption). In proxy cryptography, the original
signer(decryptor) can delegate his cryptographic operation
power to any reliable person called proxy signer(decryptor)
when he is on vacation.
Proxy cryptosystem with transformation;
In 1998, Blaze, Beamer, and Strauss [3] proposed the
notion of atomic proxy cryptography;
Transformation-free proxy cryptosystems;

Deﬁnition 1. A proxy-protected anonymous proxy decryption
(PPAPD) scheme includes the following ﬁve algorithms:
-Setup: Given the security parameter 1k, the delegatee runs
the probability generation algorithm IBEGen to get the master
secret key SKO as his secret key and the master public
parameter PKO as his public key.
-Delegation Algorithm: The delegation algorithm includes two
phases: user secret key generation and the partial proxy
private key derivation.
Secret Key Generation: Taken the public parameter PKO
as input, the delegater randomly picks a secret key SKP
and computes the corresponding public key PKP.
Following, he chooses an existential unforgeable signature
scheme S = (Gensign, Sign, Verify),

and computes the signature δ for the public key PKP. Finally, he
sends (δ, PKP) with the verifying public key to the delegatee.
Partial Proxy Private Key Derivation: Assuming the
proxy time is t. Given the tuple (δ, PKP), the public key
PKO, the secret key SKO and the proxy time t, the
delegatee ﬁrst checks the validity of the public key PKP and
of the signature δ, if either invalid, he aborts, otherwise, he
runs the private key extraction algorithm IBEExtract of IBE,
and gets the partial proxy private key SKpp. Then he sends
SKpp to the delegater.
-Encrypt: Taken the public keys PKO and PKP, the proxy time t
and the message M, the probabilistic encryption algorithm Enc
returns a ciphertext C on message M.

-Decrypt: On receiving the ciphertext C, the delegater gets the
plaintext m using the secret key SKP and the partial proxy
private key SKpp, or outputs the special symbol ⊥indicating
invalid.
Deﬁnition 2. A proxy-protected anonymous proxy signature
(PPAPS) scheme also includes ﬁve algorithms: The ﬁrst three
algorithms are same to the ones of the above proxy decryption
scheme, and the last two algorithms are as follows:
-Sign: Taken the public key PKO and PKP, the proxy time t, the
secret key SKP, the partial proxy private key SKpp and the
message M, the delegater runs the probabilistic scheme to
return the signature C on message M.
-Verify: Receiving the signature C, the veriﬁer can verify the
validity of the signature C. If verify(C, PKO, PKP, M, t) = 1, he
outputs 1, otherwise outputs invalid.

Remark 1. From the above two models, we can see the
delegatee cannot run the cryptographic operations imitating the
delegater, because he doesn’t know the secret key
corresponding to the public key of the delegater. Of course, the
delegatee can choose different public key whose corresponding
secret key is knew to him instead of the delegater, but the
delegater can publish his partial proxy private key to delate him.
Remark 2. In our model, any third party can not identify the
identity of the delegater only from the public information, but the
delegater can not deny he has run the cryptographic operation,
because the signature for the public key is sent to the
delegatee, and if the signature scheme used is existential
unforgeable, the delegatee can revoke the identity of the
delegater in dispute.

Remark 3. In fact, the public key is not combined with the
identity and any third party cannot identify the accurate identity
of the delegater. In other words, the model ensures the
anonymity of the delegation. Furthermore, if the delegatee
chooses a key pair (PKP, SKP), then he can run any
cryptographic operations using the public key which also
protects the privacy of the delegatee.

In our notion, we consider all potential actions of the adversary.
There are two types of adversaries: the outside adversaries
who aren’t delegated or the malicious delegaters who want to
imitate other delegaters, the malicious delegatee.
Deﬁnition 3. A proxy-protected anonymous proxy decryption
(PPAPD) scheme is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext
attack (IND-CCA) if no probabilistic polynomial time bound
adversary has non-negligible advantage in either Game 1 or

Partial Proxy Private Key Derivation: On receiving

Proxy Signature: The proxy signer P picks k ∈Z∗
