To aid in the interpretation of high-throughput screening (HTS) results derived from luciferase-based assays,
we used quantitative HTS, an approach that deﬁnes the concentration-response behavior of each library
sample, to proﬁle the ATP-dependent luciferase from Photinus pyralis against more than 70 000 samples.
We found that approximately 3% of the library was active, containing only compounds with inhibitory
concentration-responses, of which 681 (0.9%) exhibited IC50 < 10 µM. Representative compounds were
shown to inhibit puriﬁed P. pyralis as well as several commercial luciferase-based detection reagents but
were found to be largely inactive against Renilla reniformis luciferase. Light attenuation by the samples
was also examined and found to be more prominent in the blue-shifted bioluminescence produced by R.
reniformis luciferase than in the bioluminescence produced by P. pyralis luciferase. We describe the
structure-activity relationship of the luciferase inhibitors and discuss the use of this data in the interpretation
of HTS results and conﬁguration of luciferase-based assays.
Introduction
Bioluminescence occurs in a variety of organisms and serves
primarily as defense and communication means; the color of
luminescence is adapted to the visual systems of the organism.1
Bioluminescence colors can range from blue to red (Figure 1a).
The particular wavelength that is emitted depends in part on
the type of luciferins that is employed, and these cover diverse
structural classes (Figure 1a).2 Luciferases from organisms that
yield very bright bioluminescence have been adapted for use
as reporters in high-throughput screening (HTS)a assays, the
most common being from the jellyﬁsh Aequorea Victoria, the
sea pansy Renilla reniformis, and the ﬁreﬂy Photinus pyralis.
Fireﬂy luciferase enables a variety of HTS applications,
including reporters for gene expression in cellular signaling
assays, sensors for the ATP content of cells as a measure of
cell viability, and in biochemical assays to measure both ATP-
dependent enzyme reactions, such as kinases, and non-ATP-
dependent enzymes, such as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family
of oxidoreductases by using pro-luciferin CYP substrates.3 The
active site of ﬁreﬂy luciferase binds ATP and a luciferin
containing a benzthiazole core. The bioluminescent reaction
proceeds through the formation of a luciferyl-adenylate inter-
mediate and leads to the production of AMP, oxyluciferin, and
light (Figure 1b).4 The environment of the active site also

The spectrum of bioluminescence is shown at left along with the names
of the organisms that produce the luminescence. Also shown at right
are luciferins for ﬁreﬂy (Lampryridae) and railroad worms (Phengo-
didae), sea pansies and jellyﬁsh (Cnidarians), mollusks (Latia), and
ostracods (Crustacea; the ostracod Cypridina (Vargula) hirgendorﬁi).
(b) Enzymatic reaction of Photonis luciferase. Luciferin and adenosine
5′-triphosphate (ATP) substrates are used by luciferase to form a
luciferyl-adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) intermediate that is
subsequently oxidized in the presence of oxygen to generate light, as
well as the products oxyluciferin, CO2, and AMP.

inﬂuences the wavelength of the light emitted, and single amino
acid changes within the active site of P. pyralis luciferase can
shift the luminescence from yellow-green to red.5
Because ﬁreﬂy luciferase is used as a detection reagent in
cell- and protein-based assays, it is widely appreciated that
compounds may interfere with this detection through a variety
of mechanisms.6 These include direct inhibition of the enzyme
by speciﬁc competition with one or both substrates and
nonspeciﬁc inhibition, as for example, enzyme denaturation or
attenuation of the luminescent signal through photonic processes
such as absorbance or the inner-ﬁlter effect.7 Although not
described in the literature, luciferase assay interference has been
identiﬁed within industrial HTS laboratories by accumulating
numerous data sets from luciferase-based screens and then by
using this information to ﬂag compounds that are frequently
active in this mode of detection. However, compounds that are
active against luciferase may also be genuinely active against
the target of interest. For instance, resveratrol8,9 is a potent
luciferase inhibitor that complicates the interpretation of data
collected from luciferase-based reporter gene assays for this
compound.10 Such observations emphasize the need to under-
stand luciferase inhibition by small molecules when these are
characterized in common luciferase-based assays, particularly
those that measure cytotoxic effects where a misinterpretation
of the data could result in discarding useful leads.
A counter-screen database to ﬂag assay interferences, such
as luciferase inhibition, would be very useful, but no such
database is currently publicly available. We therefore investi-
gated the frequency and type of compounds that have activity
against ﬁreﬂy luciferase within a set of publicly accessible
compounds. We employed a concentration-response-based
screening strategy, termed quantitative high-throughput screen-
ing (qHTS),11 that produced potency values for approximately
72 000 compounds (see PubChem AID 411). The active
structures and series identiﬁed can be used to reﬁne and gain
information on the selection of actives obtained from many
commonly used luciferase-based assays. Also, we suggest a
model for how substrate-competitive inhibitors identiﬁed here
may bind in the luciferase active site, and how differences in
ATP binding between protein kinases and ﬁreﬂy luciferase may
inﬂuence the interpretation of inhibitors derived from luciferase-
coupled protein kinase assays. On the basis of these data, several
approaches to the design of luciferase assays are suggested that
should improve these assays by reducing the potential for
compound interference.
Material and Methods
Reagents. ATP, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tween 20,
potassium chloride, imidazole, resveratrol, D-luciferin, and apigenin
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Magnesium
chloride was acquired from Quality Biological (Gaithersburg, MD),
and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), certiﬁed ACS grade, was purchased
from Fisher (Waltham, MA). R. reniformis luciferase was purchased
from Chemicon International (cat. no. 4400). The luciferase-based
detection reagents used were PK-Light (Lonza, Allendale, NJ),
EasyLite (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA), and Kinase-Glo (Promega,
Madison, WI). The luciferase reporter gene reagents used were
SteadyGlo and BrightGlo (Promega). Puriﬁed wild-type P. pyralis
luciferase was obtained from Sigma (cat. no. L9506).
Preparation of Compound Libraries and Control Plates. The
72 377-member library was collected from several sources: 1280
compounds from Sigma-Aldrich (LOPAC1280), 1120 compounds
from Prestwick Chemical Inc. (Illkirch, France), 280 puriﬁed natural
products from TimTec (Newark, DE), three 1000-member combi-
natorial libraries from Pharmacopeia (Cranbury, NJ), 977 com-
pounds from Tocris (Ellisville, MO), 63 021 compounds from the
NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository,12 1981
compounds from the National Cancer Institute, and 718 compounds
from Boston University Center for Chemical Methodology and
Library Development. Libraries were prepared as described.11,13
Controls were added from a separate 1536-well compound plate
as follows: columns 1 and 2, 16-point titrations in duplicate of
resveratrol and apigenin, respectively (both beginning at 20 mM
in DMSO); column 3, neutral control (DMSO); column 4, control
inhibitor (20 mM resveratrol).
Luciferase Assay and qHTS. A total of 2 µL/well of substrate/
buffer concentrate (10 µM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.05%
BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 50 mM imidazole pH 7.2, ﬁnal
concentration) was dispensed into Kalypsys (San Diego, CA) solid
white 1536-well plates by using a bottle-valve solenoid-based
dispenser (Kalypsys). A total of 23 nL of compound solution was
transferred to the assay plate by using a Kalypsys pin tool equipped
with a 1536-pin array14 containing 10 nL slotted pins (FP1S10,
0.457 mm diameter, 50.8 mm long; V&P Scientiﬁc, San Diego,
CA). After transfer, 2 µL/well of PK-Light (resuspended in buffer
B described in ref 15) was dispensed for a ﬁnal assay volume of 4
µL/well. After an 8 min incubation at ambient temperature,
luminescence was detected by a ViewLux (Perkin-Elmer) by using
a 5 s exposure time and 1X binning. All screening operations were
performed by using a fully integrated Kalypsys robotic system
containing one RX-130 and two RX-90 Staübli anthropomorphic
robotic arms.
qHTS Data Analysis. Screening data were processed by using
in-house-developed software. Percent activity was computed from
the median values of the uninhibited, or neutral, control (32 wells
located in column 3) and the 20 µM resveratrol, or 100% inhibited,
control (32 wells, column 4). For assignment of plate concentrations
and sample identiﬁers, ActivityBase (ID Business Solutions Ltd.,
Guildford, UK) was used for compound and plate registrations. An
in-house database was used to track sample concentrations across
plates. Correction factors were generated from 18 control assay
plates containing vehicle (DMSO) only that were inserted uniformly
throughout the screen to monitor background systematic variation
in assay signal, potentially resulting from reagent dispensers or
decreases in enzyme-speciﬁc activity, for example. Curve ﬁtting
was performed by using an in-house-developed algorithm. A four-
parameter Hill equation was ﬁtted to the concentration-response
data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and
observed responses. The noise of the assay was estimated by
calculating the standard deviation (SD) of the activity values
obtained at the lowest tested compound concentration, and outliers
were identiﬁed and masked by modeling the Hill equation and
determining whether the differences exceeded the assay noise. qHTS
data was depicted by using Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).
Data were deposited in PubChem (AID 411).
SAR Analysis. The curve classiﬁcation used is the same as the
one described elsewhere.11 Brieﬂy, concentration-response curves
are categorized into four classes. Class 1 contains complete
concentration-response curves showing both upper and lower
asymptotes and r2 values greater than 0.9. Class 2 contains
incomplete concentration-response curves lacking the lower
asymptote and shows r2 values greater than 0.9. Class 3 curves are
of the lowest conﬁdence because they are deﬁned by a single
concentration point where the minimal acceptable activity is set at
3 SD of the mean activity calculated as described above. Curves
are classiﬁed as negative or positive, depending on whether they
exhibit a signal decrease (apparent inhibition) or increase (apparent
activation). Finally, class 4 contains compounds that do not show
any concentration-response curves and are therefore classiﬁed as
inactive. Active compounds were identiﬁed as a range of curve
classes from -1 through -3 to select for compounds showing signal
decreases. Once an active set of compounds was identiﬁed,
hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a 0.7 Tanimoto cutoff
was performed by using Leadscope (Leadscope Inc., Columbus,
OH) ﬁngerprints, which are ideally suited for two-dimensional
scaffold-based clustering. For each cluster, maximal common
substructures (MCS) were extracted, a manual step of MCS

trimming was performed to create a list of scaffolds, and any
overlapping scaffolds were abridged to a canonical set. Each
scaffold was then represented as a precise deﬁnition to indicate
descriptors such as the number of attachment points or the ring
size variability. All ﬁlters were then relaxed to include the entire
negative (i.e., class 4) assay data.
Analytical QC of Compounds. The entire library was subjected
to purity analysis before plating (Galapagos Biofocus DPI, South
San Francisco, CA).16 Active compounds that were obtained from
commercial sources were reanalyzed for purity. For these resupplied
compounds, the purity analysis was performed via liquid chromato-
graphy-mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis on a Waters AC-
QUITY reverse-phase UPLC system and a 1.7 M BEH column
(2.1 × 50 mm) by using a linear gradient in 0.1% aqueous formic
acid (5% ACN in water increasing to 95% over 3 min). Compound
purity was measured on the basis of peak integration from both
UV/vis absorbance and evaporative light scattering detection
(ELSD), and compound identity was determined on the basis of
mass analysis; all compounds passed purity criteria (>95%).
Follow-up Luciferase Assays. A total of 46 compounds were
obtained and subjected to several luciferase assays by using a 1536-
well plate format including the qHTS PK-Light detection conditions.
The same buffer as the one described for the qHTS assay protocol
was used for additional detection reagents, except that 2 µL of either
EasyLite or Kinase-Glo was added for detection. Fireﬂy luciferase
was assayed in the qHTS assay buffer by using P. pyralis luciferase
and
D-luciferin at ﬁnal concentrations 10 nM and 10 µM,
respectively. This assay system was also used to vary both ATP
and D-luciferin concentrations.
Luciferase reporter gene reagents (SteadyGlo and BrightGlo)
were assayed by using 5 nM puriﬁed P. pyralis luciferase (Sigma)
with no additional ATP or D-luciferin added. Activity against R.
reniformis was assayed in 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Tween
20, and 50 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.2 buffer by using 10 nM R.
reniformis luciferase and 10 µM coelentrazine. All follow-up
concentration-response curves were derived from 16 2-fold
concentrations. Each compound was assayed in duplicate, and this
experiment was repeated on two or three separate days.
Light Attenuation Assay. Experiments to assess the luminescent-
light attenuation (e.g., light-absorbing or inner-ﬁlter effects) of
compounds were performed by using a Fluoromax-4 (Horiba Jobin
Yvon, Edison, NJ) spectroﬂuorometer equipped with a single-
cuvette sample holder. Assays were performed at room temperature
by using two-chamber Spectrosil Far UV quartz cuvettes (Starna
Cells, Atascadero, CA). To observe the luminescence from a
luciferyl-luciferase reaction mixture alone, the cuvette was placed
in the sample holder such that the enzyme reaction was facing the
detector. For measurement of the light-attenuation effect of test
compounds, the second compartment was ﬁlled with the same
volume (800 µL) of compound solution in matching buffer, and
the cuvette was placed in the holder with the compound compart-
ment being situated between the luciferase-containing compartment
and the light detector. Thus, the luciferase-only and compound-
attenuated signals were measured in rapid succession by simply
ﬂipping the cuvette and exposing the respective compartments to
the detector face. In order to measure unattenuated luminescence
on this instrument, the excitation monochromator was tuned to an
IR frequency (1000 nm), and the excitation slit width was decreased
to a minimum (0.1 nm). At these settings, the background (buffer-
or substrate-only samples in the same cuvette) remained constant
from day-to-day at 160-190 cps (photon counts per second),
whereas the measured values from the different experiments
performed were generally between 104 and 5 × 106 cps. The light
emitted from the samples was measured as an emission scan
generally between 400 and 700 nm, at monochromator wavelength
steps of 2 nm and integration time of 0.1 s. The P. pyralis ﬁreﬂy
luciferase reaction used 100 µM ATP and D-luciferin with 100 nM
enzyme, and the R. reniformis reaction used 50 µM coelentrazine
and 100 nM enzyme; the buffers described above were used for
the follow-up assays. Compounds were titrated by 2-fold dilutions
starting at a concentration of 100 µM until no quenching was
observed. The emission slit width was 5 nm for the ﬁreﬂy luciferase
assays and 10 nm for the R. reniformis experiments.
Modeling of Luciferase Inhibitor. Modeling of substrate
competitive inhibitors and comparison of ATP binding between a
protein kinase and luciferase was performed by using the luciferase
protein from Japanese ﬁreﬂy (PDB code 2D1R)5 and the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein kinase, cocrystalized with
a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor or an ATP analogue (PDB codes
1M1717 and 2GS7,18 respectively). The Japanese ﬁreﬂy structure
was chosen because it was solved in complex with both oxyluciferin
and AMP. The Japanese ﬁreﬂy and P. pyralis luciferase show high
overall sequence similarity (68% identity and 82% similarity with
only a single amino acid gap), and their binding sites are nearly
perfectly conserved. We therefore reasoned that the Japanese ﬁreﬂy
structure is an acceptable model for luciferase bound to substrates
or inhibitors in either the AMP- or luciferin-binding site. All
inhibitor-binding models were built manually starting from either
of the cocrystallized substrates in the structure 2D1R and were
further optimized by using MOE (Molecular Operating Environ-
ment, 2006).
Results
Luciferase qHTS. To proﬁle the chemical library for activity
against luciferase, the luciferase enzyme from P. pyralis was
assayed by using a commercially available detection system
containing enzyme, luciferin, and buffer components.15 The
enzyme activity was linear over a range of 5-20 µM of ATP,
and 10 µM was chosen for the assay. The screen was performed
in a 1536-well plate format with a ﬁnal assay volume of 4 µL
per well. Resveratrol and apigenin, luciferase inhibitors identiﬁed
through a counter-screen of pyruvate kinase actives,11 were used
as inhibitor controls.
Luciferase activity was screened against small molecules by
using a concentration-response method (qHTS).11 Unlike
traditional HTS, where libraries are tested at a single concentra-
tion, qHTS measures activity across multiple concentrations
allowing the generation of titration-response curves for all
library compounds. In the luciferase qHTS, the library was tested
as a series of at least seven 5-fold dilutions beginning at a
concentration of 57 µM for ∼85% of the compounds and 25 or
11 µM for the remainder.
A total of 441 1536-well microtiter plates were processed.
The 426 plates accepted for further analysis averaged a signal-
to-background ratio of 7.9 ( 0.9 and Z′ ) 0.85 ( 0.08,
indicating a strong and consistent assay response over the entire
screen. During the run, a dispenser tip was partially blocked
for 16 plates, which caused lower Z′ values (0.18-0.59) and
20% lower activity for the affected compounds (Figure 2A).
The inhibitor control titrations included on every plate were
highly precise, and the minimum signiﬁcance ratios (MSR,
minimum signiﬁcance ratio that represents the smallest potency
ratio between two measurements that is statistically signiﬁcant
with 95% conﬁdence)19 for resveratrol and apigenin were 1.8
and 1.6, respectively (Figure 2B).
The luciferase qHTS resulted in titration-response proﬁles
of 72 377 samples derived from 654 336 assayed wells (Figure
2A). Screening was performed at a rate of 6.6 samples/s on the
Kalypsys automated screening platform, thus generating data
for one concentration-response curve per second. Concentra-
tion-response curves were ﬁtted to the data corresponding to
each sample and categorized into four classes: (1) complete
response curves containing upper and lower asymptotes, (2)
incomplete response curves having an upper asymptote, (3)
poorly ﬁt curves or activity only at the highest tested concentra-
tion, and (4) inactive where activity was below 30%.11
The screen identiﬁed 2311 samples comprising 3.1% of the
library as active (classes 1-3) and 70 061 as inactive (class 4).

Auld et al.
All actives were inhibitors. Compounds associated with the
highest quality curves, classes 1a, 1b, and 2a, comprising 209,
136, and 247 samples, respectively, represented 0.8% of the
collection (Figure 2C). Class 2b was the largest class of actives,
containing 1295 samples, whereas class 3 totaled 424 samples.
The luciferase qHTS tested compound activities at concentra-
tions from 3.7 nM to as high as 57 µM. We estimated that the
luciferase concentration was ∼1 nM in the assay,15 indicating
that our determination of inhibitor IC50 should be accurate
because the enzyme concentration was below the lowest tested
compound concentration. The distribution of potencies for each
curve class indicated that, as expected, the mean IC50 increased
with decreasing curve class quality (Table 1). The class 1a
category contained the most potent inhibitor, and IC50 values
ranged from 0.04 to 5 µM, whereas class 1b potencies spanned
from 0.25 to 8 µM. The potencies of class 2 compounds were
lower, class 2a and 2b compounds having IC50 g 1.3 µM and
IC50 g 0.4 µM, respectively. Many class 2b and 3 IC50 values
were above the highest tested concentration; these were
extrapolated from incomplete curves; therefore, they should be
considered approximations.
Luciferase SAR. Active library members with high-
conﬁdence curve classes (1a, 1b, and 2a) were selected and
subjected to hierarchical clustering by using Leadscope ﬁnger-
prints to generate MCS. Seven chemotypes were chosen for
further analysis on the basis of the number of analogues
associated with the MCS, potency of these analogues, and
known biological information associated with the compounds
(see Figure 3 for core structures). For example, the most highly
representative structures observed from this analysis were the
2 aryl-substituted benzo-[d]thiazole, -imidazole, and -oxazole-
containing series, likely analogues of the benzthiazole-based
luciferin substrate. We also selected four clusters that did not
show obvious similarity to either luciferin or ATP, represented
by a set of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles, a series of quinoline compounds,
and several compounds with a substituted (Z)-(amino)prop-2-
en-1-one core or benzlyamide core, as well as compounds with
known pharmacological activity. Substructure searches against
the entire library were performed by using the scaffolds that
deﬁned each of these clusters in order to deﬁne a chemical series
composed of active and inactive analogues.
We next examined the bioactivity proﬁle for active com-
pounds found within each chemical series across 39 qHTS
assays performed at the NCGC. These included six luciferase-
based assays and 33 assays that used ﬂuorescence detection
involving reporters such as GFP or -lactamase, or reagents
such as protease proﬂuorescent peptide substrates. On average,
three-quarters of the active compounds in each cluster identiﬁed
from the luciferase qHTS were found to be active in all six
luciferase assays, whereas the activity averaged only 10% across
the 33 nonluciferase-based assays (Figure 3). Luciferase-coupled
enzyme assays that used the same luciferase-based detection
reagent showed the highest degree of correlation (Figure 3a-g,
ﬁrst two dark gray bars, qHTS assays 1 and 2). Within each
luciferase active series, the fraction of active compounds was
often found to be >50% for luciferase assays with a cell-based
format, and the unrelated red-luminescence-emitting click beetle
luciferase showed the lowest activity for each series. In some
series, the fraction of active compounds was found to be ∼50%
in nonluciferase assays; for example, a series containing core 4
(quinoline, Figure 3d, qHTS assays 12 and 13) was active in
two ﬂuorescence-based enzyme assays. The activity in these
two assays was associated with lower-conﬁdence curve classes
(e.g., class 3) and gave rise to activation of the assay signal.
Therefore, for these ﬂuorescence-based assays, the activity of
quinoline compounds appears to be due to sample ﬂuorescence
(for further discussion of ﬂuorescent compound interference see
ref 20). We next wished to understand the range of activity these
compounds displayed against various luciferase-based assay
formats and the nature of this inhibition.
Benzthiazole Series. We chose to focus on a set of benz-
thiazole compounds because of the high similarity to the 2-(4,5-
dihydrothiazol-2-yl)benzo[d]thiazole core of luciferin (Figure
1). Compounds containing core 1 (benzthiazole, Figure 3) were
one of the largest chemical series with 89 active analogues and
524 inactive analogues (Figure 4a). The potency of the active
analogues covered a large range, the most potent compound
approaching 100 nM, and many showing class 1 concentration-
response curves (Figure 4a). Compounds containing core 2
(benzimidazole, Figure 3) or 3 (benzoxazole, Figure 3) were
less active, and core 2 contained more actives of broader potency
than core 3 (compare Figure 4b and c). Also, core 3 showed a

ﬂatter potency distribution, exhibiting mainly class 2 curves,
compared to either core 1 or 2.
Representative active analogues containing core 1 identiﬁed
in the qHTS were obtained and tested for assay-format sensitiv-
ity in several commonly used luciferase detection kits and
against puriﬁed P. pyralis luciferase or R. reniformis luciferase
(Table 2) to examine selectivity. Compounds 1a-h inhibited
all the common ﬁreﬂy-based detection formats, except the
Promega Kinase-Glo reagent, for which we observed reduced
inhibition for these compounds in several instances. Kinase-
Glo utilizes a different ﬁreﬂy luciferase (Photuris pennsylVanica)
mutated for improved HTS performance and stability (Promega,
personal communication). Wild-type P. pennsylVanica shows
48.7% identity (∼68% similarity) to P. pyralis,21,22 and
therefore, the reduced activity observed here is not surprising.
However, variation of the R2 position modulated selectivity
against the P. pennsylVanica luciferase in some cases. For
example, compound 1b (CID 1225609) containing 5-methylth-
iophene at position R1 is inactive at a 57 µM testing concentra-
tion, whereare the des-methyl analogue (1a, CID 670282)
showed an IC50 ≈10 µM (IC50Promega, Table 2). Furthermore,
compounds 1d (CID 887167) and 1e (CID 1245272) containing
the 2-methlyfuran moiety at R1 showed appreciable inhibitory
activity against this detection reagent (IC50Promega ≈4 µM). This
ﬁnding suggests that large-scale screening with P. pennsylVanica
ﬁreﬂy luciferase would identify inhibitors with a different SAR
than what is described here for P. pyralis.
To probe the mode of inhibition, we measured the IC50 for
compounds shown in Table 2 at various ATP and luciferin
substrate concentrations. Accordingly, compounds 1a-f were
found to be luciferin antagonists, because increasing the luciferin
to 1 mM abolished the inhibition, whereas increasing ATP only
marginally affected the inhibition by using a Km level of luciferin
(see Figure 5a for example). We also observed reduced
inhibition when puriﬁed luciferase was added to the reporter
gene reagents (ICSteadyGlo and IC50BrightGlo, Table 2) in compa-
rision to an assay that used puriﬁed luciferase, and Km levels
of substrates (IC50Luc, Table 2) suggesting reporter gene
formulations use high concentrations of luciferase substrates.
However, for the most potent compounds analyzed in this series.
compound 1g (CID 2350207) and compound 1h (CID 727725),
we noted that this strict dependence on luciferin substrate
concentration disappeared, and the potency showed only
marginal shifts at high substrate concentrations. For example,
compound 1g inhibition depended on ATP in addition to
luciferin concentration. In contrast, the IC50 of compound 1h
varied slightly from 0.3 to 1 µM at Km vs saturating luciferin
and ATP levels, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly,
compound 1h had appreciable activity in the P. pennsylVanica
ﬁreﬂy reagent cocktail, whereas its inactivity against R. reni-
formis luciferase implies a nonspeciﬁc effect, such as light
attenuation, as a mechanism of compound 1h inhibition. The
R2 group of compound 1h can act to modulate potency but also
changes inhibition mode, possibly via interactions that exclude

ATP binding and the formation of the luciferly adenylate
intermediate. Stable analogues of the luciferyl-AMP intermedi-
ate have been shown to be potent inhibitors of ﬁreﬂy luciferase
that act in a noncompetitive manner.23
Quinoline Series. A series of substituted quinilones were
examined on the basis of the known activity of quinolines as
competitive inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as
protein kinases.24 Compounds containing core 4 contained fewer
library analogues with potency in the micromolar range (Figure
4d). However, approximately half of the activity was associated
with class 1 curves.
Representative compounds were obtained and subjected to
the analysis described above (Table 3). In all cases, the inhibition
mediated by these compounds could be competed by varying
either luciferin or ATP, and the compounds were found to be
inactive at 1 mM concentrations of both substrates (Figure 5b).
As mentioned above, the absence of inhibition in the reporter
gene formulations may be explained by the probable high
substrate concentrations present in these assay mixtures and the
dependence of potency on substrate concentration observed for
the quinoline series. Further, none of the compounds showed
strong inhibition in the P. pennsylVanica ﬁreﬂy reagent cocktail,

suggesting that these compounds do not interact with a
conserved site in the two luciferases.
The quinoline series was also the only series analyzed that
showed consistent inhibition against the R. reniformis luciferase.
In general, this inhibition was ∼10-fold weaker than what was
found against puriﬁed P. pyralis, but some compounds showed
IC50 ≈10 µM (e.g., 4a, CID 3241312 and 4c, CID: 3238892),
which is comparable to typical compound screening concentra-
tions. Light attenuation is not the likely mechanism of R.
reniformis inhibition by these series (see below). It is possible
that the 2-phenylquinoline core is also able to antagonize R.
reniformis substrate binding by mimicking the phenyl-imida-
zopyrazinone core of coelenterazine (see Figure 1). Substitutions
at all three phenyl groups around the imidazopyrazinone core
have been used to modulate the wavelength of bioluminescence
of R. reniformis luciferase, suggesting some plasticity in
substrate binding.25
Luciferase Inhibitors Showing Noncompetitive Inhibition.

inhibition had marginal dependence on the concentration of

either substrate, which is consistent with a noncompetitive
inhibition mode (i.e., IC50 ≈Ki).26 One of the most prominent
series in this category identiﬁed in the qHTS were compounds
containing core 5 (1,2,4-oxadiazole, Table 4). Here, among the
large number of analogues present within the compound library,
approximately one-third were active (Figure 4e), displaying a
broader range of potencies than the benzoxazole series (Figure
4c).
Varying substrate concentration did not signiﬁcantly change
the IC50 values of the oxadiazole series (Figure 5c). Compounds
in this series showed inhibition across all the luciferase cocktails
containing P. pyralis, with weaker inhibition at the P. penn-
sylVanica ﬁreﬂy reagent cocktail (Table 4). The most potent
oxadiazole 5c (CID 926663, Table 4, IC50 ≈200 nM) inhibited
all detection reagents but only weakly inhibited the P. penn-
sylVanica and R. reniformis luciferases. In compound 5c, a
pyridine at position R1 improves the potency of this series
between 4- and 10-fold over phenyl (compound 5a, CID
3241690).
Another series contained core 6 ((Z)-(R1amino)prop-2-en-1-
one). Although few closely related analogues were present in
the compound collection for this series, nearly half of the actives
showed class 1 concentration-response curves, and several
showed potencies well below 1 µM (Figure 4f). Representative
analogues containing core 6 were obtained (compounds 6a-e,
Table 5) and subjected to further analysis. Compound 6c (CID
2260658) was one of the most potent compounds identiﬁed
within this series (IC50 ≈100 nM). Variation of both ATP and
luciferin showed inhibition of a noncompetitive nature similar
to the oxadiazole shown in Figure 5c.
A series of compounds containing core 7 (benzyl amides,
Table 6) also contained noncompetitive inhibitors with numerous
analogues, among which nearly one-third were active in the
luciferase assay (Figure 4g). Several of these compounds showed
activity <1 µM, with an average potency of just below 10 µM.
The most potent compound 7c (CID 649849), carrying a
5-methyl pyridin-2-yl at position R1, had an IC50 of ∼300 nM
in all luciferase detection reagents except the P. pennsylVanica
ﬁreﬂy reagent cocktail. This series was largely inactive on R.
reniformis luciferase, which is in agreement with the other
noncompetitive series. The apparent R. reniformis luciferase
activity of compound 7a (CID 5483116) is thought to derive
from luminescence attenuation not enzyme inhibition (discussed
further below). Compound 7a is a known γ-aminobutyric acid
receptor antagonist. We noted several additional compounds,
the biological activities of which are known, and we describe
these in the following section.
Luciferase Activity within Known Bioactive Compounds.
The libraries screened in this study included a number of
commonly used bioactive compound libraries and some puriﬁed
natural product libraries obtained from commercial sources. We
have indicated in Tables 7 and 8 the known bioactive com-
pounds that were subjected to further analysis, and these are
discussed in turn.
A series of bioactives including ﬂavonoids and known
inhibitors of enzymes such as kinases27–29 is shown in Table 7.
Many protein kinase HTS assays monitor ATP depletion through
a reduction of luminescence from the ATP-dependent ﬁreﬂy
luciferase reaction. Here, compounds that inhibit both the
luciferase and the protein kinase will have opposite effects on
the luminescent signal, potentially resulting in false negatives.
In general, these compounds were of low molecular weight
(MW) (<300). Similar to series with cores 1-7 described above,
the compounds had greatly reduced or no activity against P.

pennsylVanica and R. reniformis. The most potent compound
against P. pyralis luciferase was ﬂavonoid 9 from the TimTec
library, having an IC50 of 50 nM against puriﬁed ﬁreﬂy
luciferase, demonstrating noncompetitive behavior and activity
in the ﬁreﬂy-based luminescence reporter assays (see p53 assay,
PubChem AID 902 and 924). However, another ﬂavonoid, 10,
annotated as a noncompetitive inhibitor of mitogen activated
protein kinase,30 showed signiﬁcantly weaker inhibition that was
relieved by using 1 mM concentrations of luciferin or ATP.
Inhibition by compound 8 (indoprofen)31 and compound 12
could also be reduced by using high concentrations of either
substrate, whereas compound 11 (piﬁthrin-R),28 containing an
imino-tetrahydrobenzothiazole core, exhibited noncompetitive
inhibition; the potency did not vary appreciably in the presence
of 1 mM of each substrate (IC50 ) 1.6 µM).
In addition to the previously described resveratrol,10 we
observed a series of diaryl compounds, the predominant
structural class of which is associated with inhibition of
metabotropic glutamate signaling (Table 8). Inhibition by all
these compounds was relieved in the presence of 1 mM luciferin
and ATP, and the majority showed reduced inhibition against
R. reniformis. The exceptions were inhibitors 15 and 16,
involved with glutamate pharmacology;32,33 however, these
compounds demonstrated optical interference (see below, Sup-
porting Information, Figure S1).
Potential Binding Modes of the Quinoline and Benzthia-
zole Inhibitors. The substrate-competitive binding mechanism
of the benzthiazole and quinoline series supported modeling
these into the active site of ﬁreﬂy luciferase. The quinoline core
is a known scaffold for many ATP-competitive protein kinase
inhibitors, and as mentioned above, compounds with dual
luciferase and protein kinase activity could result in false
negatives when ﬁreﬂy luciferase-based detection is used.
Therefore, we were interested in comparing the adenosine
pockets of protein kinases and ﬁreﬂy luciferase to examine
whether this quinoline series could be accommodated by the
ATP binding pocket of protein kinases. Also, to examine the
mode of binding of the benzthiazole series, we modeled this
into the active site of ﬁreﬂy luciferase.
We ﬁrst examined the adenosine binding pockets for both
ﬁreﬂy luciferase and a typical protein kinase, the EGFR kinase.
In both the luciferase and the EGFR kinase cases, adenosine
binds in a narrow groove but with quite different contacts
(Figure 6a,c). The packing contacts in protein kinases, Val702,
Ala719, and Leu820 (Figure 6a), involve lipophilic amino acids,
typically Val, Ala, Leu, or Met. In contrast, the stacking
interactions between adenosine and luciferase include an
edge-face aromatic interaction (Tyr342) and packing between
the backbone of the -turn between Gly318 and Pro320. In both
cases, adenosine further interacts through hydrogen bonds with
its N1 and amino group. The hydrogen bonds to the protein
kinase are to a backbone NH and a carbonyl oxygen of a short
-strand called the hinge region. In the case shown, the hydrogen
bonds are with the NH of Met769 and the backbone carbonyl
of residue 767. For the luciferase protein, the NH2 of adenosine
forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Gly341,
whereas N1 of adenosine forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond
with the side chain of Gln340. In both cases, the ribose makes
limited contacts with the respective binding site and appears to
act more as a spacer between adenosine and the phosphates.
The 2′-hydroxyl interacts with Asp424 of the Japanese ﬁreﬂy
luciferase. In many protein kinases, an interaction between the
2′-hydroxyl and an aspartic acid is also observed. This aspartic
acid is the equivalent to Cys773 in EGFR shown in Figure 6a,
whereas in other protein kinases, this residue can be Asp, Glu,
Gln, Ser, Thr, and Ala, which indicates that this is not a critical
interaction. Finally, the motifs for recognizing the phosphates
bear no similarity between the two enzymes. The phosphates
of ATP interact with the protein kinase through a pair of bound
Mg2+ ions. Additionally, the protein kinase provides a lysine
(Lys721 in EGFR) to interact with the R-phosphate. The lysines
are the only point of similarity between the protein kinase and

luciferase phosphate-binding sites (Lys721 in EGFR and Lys531
in luciferase). The phosphate of AMP interacts with luciferase
through a large number of backbone and side-chain hydrogen
bonds.
We next modeled the quionline 4c (CID 3238892) into the
adenosine pocket of luciferase. The quinoline/quinazoline core
is a well-known scaffold for protein kinases and represents one
of the earliest classes of small-molecule protein kinase inhibi-
tors.34 It has been shown crystallographically that the quinazo-
line/quinoline binds to the protein kinase through a key hydrogen
bond with N1 to the hinge backbone NH of the protein kinase;17
in essence, N1 of the quinoline mimics the interaction between
adenosine N1-Met769 NH (Figure 6b). In this binding mode,
however, the protein kinase adenosine pocket would not stericly
tolerate a phenyl ring at the C2 position for the quinoline-based
luciferase inhibitor because of a steric clash with the backbone
carbonyl of residue 767 (Figure 6b). Indeed, in order to
accommodate the 2-phenyl substitution, the crystallographically
observed binding mode for the quinazoline would have to shift
so far that the N1 nitrogen would no longer be able to form the
critical interaction with the backbone NH of the hinge.
Compound 4c could be accommodated in the luciferase active
site in a mode where both the AMP and luciferin binding would
be expected to be affected, which is consistent with the substrate
variation studies mentioned above (see Figure 6d). This points
the 2-phenyl toward the luciferin-binding site and the piperazine
and subsequent polar groups toward the phosphate-binding site
which is both polar and solvent-exposed; this is consistent with
the tolerance for a wide variety of polar substituents. Thus, these
larger (MW > 375) quinoline-based luciferase inhibitors can
be accommodated into the luciferase substrate pocket but are
unlikely to bind to protein kinases with the binding mode
consistently observed in protein kinase/quinoline cocrystal
structures. (Both 4d (CID 1540951) and 4c were subsequently
checked for activity against the kinases IR, LCK, EGFR, and
PKA and were found to be inactive (the highest tested
concentration was 20 µM; Reaction Biology Corp., Malvern,
PA).)
Modeling of the benzthiazole-based luciferase inhibitor 1a
into the luciferase pocket illustrates how this molecule can ﬁt
into the narrow pocket occupied by that of oxyluciferin (Figure
6e,f). This pocket is formed from above by aromatic stacking
with Phe249 and from below by the C of Ala350 and the
backbone of Gly343-Leu344. This orientation points the
thiophene toward the AMP pocket, where extension at the R2
position would protrude into the AMP phosphate-binding site
and would suggest a more mixed inhibition pattern for larger
R2 substituents, which is consistent with what was observed with
compounds 1g and 1h.
Examination of Light Attenuation by Luciferase Inhibi-
tors. A mode of nonspeciﬁc inhibition could arise through
compound-speciﬁc absorbance or light scattering. In this case,
compounds that interfere with luminescence detection could
appear as luciferase inhibitors. We compared the absorbance
spectrum for representative compounds from each series to
the emission spectrum of either ﬁreﬂy or R. reniformis luciferase

(Figure 7a). The majority of the compounds characterized here
were colorless in solution and absorbed light below 400 nm.
However, a few compounds absorbed light between 400 and
550 nm. To test light attenuation, we prepared samples in a
split cuvette; one-half of the cuvette was ﬁlled with the luciferase
reaction and the other half contained the compound solution in
the same buffer. In this experiment, measurement of lumines-
cence through the compound solution gives information on
absorbance, and the same cuvette can be used to measure
unattenuated luminescence by simply rotating the cuvette so
that the light is detected directly from the luciferase reaction.
We selected this mode of detection because we wanted to
measure optical interferences by these compounds in a manner
that was completely separate from any enzyme-speciﬁc effects.
The most highly colored compound tested in follow-up assays
was compound 15, a dark blue dye (showing broad absorption
between 450 and 600 nm, data not shown) that weakly inhibited
both R. reniformis and the reporter gene formulations (10-20
µM IC50), and we found that this compound was able to quench
approximately 50% of the luminescence from either R. reni-
formis or P. pyralis luciferases at a concentration of 20 µM
(Supporting Information, Figure S1). Similarly, compounds such
as lissamine or napthol blue black that showed either pink or
dark blue solutions, respectively, were able to attenuate lumi-
nescence produced by P. pyralis luciferase, whereas compounds
having yellow or brown solutions such as tartrazine or for
compound 16 did not affect P. pyralis luciferase luminescence,
even at 100 µM; this is consistent with the emission spectrum
of ﬁreﬂy luciferase. However, when R. reniformis luciferase was
used in the reaction, we were able to detect light attenuation at
100 µM compound 16 (Supporting Information, Figure S1),
which is consistent with its visible absorbance spectrum
(absorption between 400 and 500 nm, Figure 7a). Also, an active
series of 3-substituted 2H-chromen-2-ones contained a potent
member 18 (CID 94381, Supporting Information, Figure S1,
Figure 7b), and we observed a ﬂuorescent-yellow solution for
this compound with strong absorption between 400 and 525
nm (Figure 7a). The absorbance of compound 18 largely
overlapped the emission spectrum of R. reniformis luciferase
(Figure 7a), and we found that compound 18 attenuated light
emitted from R. reniformis but not P. pyralis luciferase (Figure
7c).
Discussion
Luciferase enzymes are used widely in HTS as reporters in
cell-based assays and as sensors of ATP concentration in cell
viability or in biochemical assays of kinases; their use has been
extended to measure the activity of proteases and cytochrome
P450s as well.3 Because of this widespread use, an understand-
ing of the chemotypes that can directly affect this enzyme’s
activity and thus lead to assay-related artifacts is critical. In
addition, on the basis of the evolutionary diversity of ﬁreﬂy
luciferases, their utilization of ATP, and the fact that these
enzymes are naturally outﬁtted with a robust assay, luciferases
are an ideal model system for chemical genomics. We have
therefore tested the activity of a large publicly available chemical
library against ﬁreﬂy luciferase and established a comprehensive
proﬁle of the library members that inhibit the enzyme.
The assay showed excellent performance in a continuous
robotic experiment where concentration-response curves for
72 377 compounds were determined in a single experiment.

With this primary screening data, we performed SAR analyses
to identify structural characteristics of the inhibitors. The active
series identiﬁed in the luciferase qHTS provide a rich database
for comparison to other screening results obtained from com-
monly used ﬁreﬂy luciferase-based detection reagents (PubChem
AID 411; we will continue to update this data set as new
compounds are added). All of the identiﬁed chemical series also
inhibited wild-type P. pyralis luciferase, and many inhibited
luciferase-based detection reagents from other suppliers. The
potencies of these compounds were within the concentration
ranges typically were tested in HTS (e.g., 10 µM), many
compounds showed IC50 values <1 µM. Additionally, com-
parison of the luciferase actives to 39 other qHTS campaigns
performed at our center indicated that these compounds
exhibited activity in assays utilizing luciferase, including one
that employs a luciferase from the luminous click beetle P.
plagiophthalamus. Therefore, these scaffolds will be useful to
ﬂag, because these compounds have the potential of inhibiting
this common reporter in a variety of HTS formats. We noted
that a reporter-gene-based assay that used Steadylite (Perkin-
Elmer reagent; PubChem AID 618) for detection showed a 53%
overlap between the actives derived by using a 6 SD cutoff of
the reported percent control values and our luciferase actives
showing class 1 curves. In addition, for compounds identiﬁed
as activators in cell-based luciferase reporter assays (e.g., AID
522), we noted an enrichment (>10-fold) of luciferase inhibitors
suggesting the potential of reporter stabilization through lu-
ciferase-inhibitor complex formation.
The most prominent clusters identiﬁed in our study contained
the benzthiazole, benzimidazole, or benzoxazole core. The high
representation of these chemotypes in luciferase actives is likely
related to the benzthiazole-based luciferin substrate and ATP
dependence of ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Several of the benzthiazole
series were competitive with luciferin; however, modulation of
the R2 group could change the substrate dependence to a
noncompetitive mode, potentially by engaging the adenylate-
binding site as suggested by our modeling studies (Figure 6).
One of the most striking practical and evolutionary features
of nearly all the luciferase actives identiﬁed here was their
relative inactivity against the luciferase detection reagent that
uses a variant of P. pennsylVanica ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Although
certain compounds showed appreciable inhibition (IC50 e 10
µM), the majority was inactive, and none showed inhibition
comparable to what was observed in P. pyralis-based reagents.

in yellow was taken from the EGFR cocrystal structure 1M17. The 2-phenyl (purple) substituent was added with ideal geometry, keeping the rest
of the molecule ﬁxed and ignoring the protein. In this binding mode, the N1 of the quinazoline makes the equivalent hydrogen bond to N1 of the
adenosine. A phenyl at the position 2 of the quinazoline (purple side chain) directly clashes with the backbone of the hinge residues, in this case
767. In order to sterically ﬁt, the 2-phenyl quinazoline would have to considerably shift position, signiﬁcantly disrupting the critical N1-hinge-NH
hydrogen bond. (c) Binding of AMP in ﬁreﬂy luciferase taken from the cocrystal structure (PDB code 2D1R). (d) Modeling of the quinoline 4c
(yellow chain) into the luciferase pocket. The best ﬁt has the quinoline occupying approximately the same space as the purine of AMP, and N1 of
the quinoline is near N7 of the purine. This allows the 2-phenyl substituent to reach into the luciferin binding pocket in nearly the identical space
as shown for the benzthiazole. This quinoline-series binding mode further allows the polar substituent to extend into the phosphate-binding region,
which is consistent with the fact that the luciferase inhibitory activity is tolerant of a number of polar substituents at this position. (e) Binding of
luciferin in ﬁreﬂy luciferase taken from the cocrystal structure (PDB code 2D1R). (f) Modeling of the benzthiazole 1a (purple chain) into the

However, small changes in structure within a benzthiazole
scaffold (compare compounds 1a and 1b) could lead to weak
inhibition, suggesting that inhibition of P. pennsylVanica is just
as achievable as what we observed here for P. pyralis but will
exhibit a different SAR. We are currently testing this by using
a reagent cocktail containing P. pennsylVanica luciferase and a
full qHTS of the compound collection to determine the extent
of inhibition.
Compounds such as 18 illustrate the complexity of decon-
voluting nonspeciﬁc interference by light absorption from
genuine inhibition of the luciferase enzyme. Compound 18
showed potent inhibition in detection reagents employing ﬁreﬂy
luciferase, and this inhibition could be relieved by adding excess
substrates. Furthermore, the benzimidazole core present in
compound 18 is consistent with the SAR shown here for ﬁreﬂy
luciferase inhibitors, and closely related analogues were present
in the luciferase screen that showed greatly reduced activity
(e.g., compound 20, CID 100335, Supporting Information, Table
S1). Therefore, this series appears to be a genuine inhibitor of
the ﬁreﬂy luciferase enzyme. However, this series also contains
a coumarin chromophore, and we observed a potency of 5 µM
for compound 18 against R. reniformis luciferase. From the light-
attenuation experiment and the absorbance spectrum of this
compound, it is possible that its apparent luciferase-inhibition
activity is due to light absorption by the compound. It is difﬁcult
to
correlate
the
amount
of
light
attenuation
obser-
ved in the cuvette experiment described above to that which
occurs in a 1536-well assay volume. Therefore, although the
coumarin series compounds exempliﬁed by 18 appear to be
ﬁreﬂy luciferase enzyme inhibitors, proper assignment of the
activity against R. reniformis luciferase will require further
investigation. In general, the interpretation problems presented
by these types of colored compounds in HTS must be kept in
mind, because they may act as enzyme inhibitors, light
attenuators (particularly of blue-shifted luminescence), or both.
Several general strategies for determining and reducing
luciferase assay interference can be derived from this proﬁling
study. First, ﬁreﬂy or red-shifted variants of the P. plagioph-
thalamus luciferase should be employed whenever possible to
eliminate nonspeciﬁc light attenuation effects. R. reniformis
luciferase emits predominately blue luminescence (<3% of
photons having wavelengths >600 nm),35 rendering this lu-
ciferase more sensitive to optical interference by the many small-
molecule compounds that absorb light in this range. A recent
ﬂuorescence proﬁle of the library used here showed that ∼0.1%
of the compounds emitted ﬂuorescence by using 480 nm
excitation light20 that is near the emission maximum of R.
reniformis. Second, the use of bandpass ﬁlters to collect only
the bathochromic light emitted by ﬁreﬂy luciferase (i.e., 600
nm) rather than the clear ﬁlters typically used is advisable in
order to decrease light attenuation, if the signal strength is
adequate. The use of bandpass ﬁlters in two-color dual-
luciferase-based assays has been described for 1536-well cell-
based assay systems,36 and in principle, such a strategy could
be used for any luminescent-based assay. This strategy is
analogous to the use of red-shifted ﬂuorophores to reduce
compound ﬂuorescence.20 Third, the complete lack of luciferase
activators identiﬁed in the present study suggests that luciferase-
coupled reactions are ideal for assays where stimulation of the
luminescent signal is desired, because the direct activation of
the luciferase enzyme reaction by library compounds appears
to be very rare.
The luciferases P. pyralis and R. reniformis have been a
popular choice for constructing dual-luciferase-based assays, but
the marked differences in SAR and optical interference we have
observed here between these two luciferases suggest that such

assays should be constructed with more homologous pairs of
luciferases. For example, red- and green-emitting versions of
luminous click beetle P. plagiophthalamus luciferase have been
engineered by introducing single amino acid changes in the
luciferin-binding site.37 In this assay format, a single detection
reagent containing the benzthiazole-based luciferin substrate is
added to detect both red- and green-emitting reporters. These
nearly identical engineered click beetle luciferases represent an
ideal design for dual-luciferase-based assays, because the
inhibition proﬁle should reﬂect a similar SAR. Also, the red
and green shifted luminescence will render this reporter less
susceptible to optical compound interferences.
The largest series of luciferase inhibitors in this study
contained a 2-aryl-substituted benzo- [d]thiazole, -imidazole,
and -oxazole cores. Modeling of a benzthiazole inhibitor
supported that this type of inhibitor overlaps the same space as
the luciferin substrate, and certain substitutions are capable of
protruding into the AMP pocket as well. The benzthiazole
conforms to a narrow groove created above by Phe249 and
below by the C of Ala350 and the backbone of Gly343-Leu344.
With compound 1g, the methoxy-phenyl is positioned so that
the ether and subsequent carbonyl oxygen can mimic hydrogen
bonds observed between the phosphate of AMP and luciferase.
This positions the piperizine so that its basic center is in the
polar and solvent-exposed phosphate-binding site. Therefore,
this type of compound inhibits ﬁreﬂy luciferase by direct
competition with luciferin or by an interaction with both the
luciferin and AMP pocket, and we noted both modes of
inhibition within a series of benzthiazole compounds identiﬁed
here. In uncharacterized compound collections, such scaffolds
should be examined in orthogonal assays to properly assign the
activity.
The use of luciferase-based detection for measuring protein
kinase activity is a common practice in HTS.6 Compounds that
inhibit via interaction with the ATP-binding site are the most
common type of protein kinase inhibitors. Dual inhibitors of
luciferases and protein kinases are certainly possible because
of the ATP dependence of both enzymes. Such compounds are
unlikely to be scored as active because inhibition of both the
protein kinase and the luciferase will have opposite effects on
the luminescent signal, potentially resulting in false negatives.
We identiﬁed a series of low MW compounds (<300 Da,
compounds 8-12) from the qHTS that have been annotated as
protein kinase inhibitors, and these showed inhibition patterns
of luciferase that suggest interactions with both the AMP- and
luciferin-binding pockets. Flavonoids such as 10, a known µM
MEK inhibitor, have planar structures that can be accommodated
in the narrow groove of either kinase or luciferase enzymes.
Therefore, dual activity may be common in such compounds,
and the luciferase reaction should be measured by using multiple
time points, or an alterative assay format should be used to
address this issue.38
The quinoline/quinazoline core is commonly found in ATP-
competitive protein kinase inhibitors, and we identiﬁed a series
of quinoline-based luciferase inhibitors. We were interested in
determining whether our quinoline series could be easily
accommodated into the adenosine pocket of protein kinase by
using the known protein kinase binding for quinolines. However,
in this case, we noted large differences in adenosine binding
between protein kinases and luciferase and a clash with the
backbone of the gate-keeper residue when attempting to model
a representative quinoline-based inhibitor into the adenosine
pocket of a typical protein kinase. Therefore, for such larger
(>375 daltons) heterocyclic compounds, a different SAR is
likely between luciferase and protein kinase inhibitors. Broad-
based screening of a publicly available compound collection
against protein kinases has not been performed to date, but such
information would be extremely useful in further deﬁning the
SAR of different ATP-dependent enzymes. Such a data set not
only would be useful for identifying potential assay interferences
as detailed here but would also aid in understanding the
selectivity rules for ATPases in general.
We also identiﬁed a large collection of compounds that
showed no obvious structural similarity to either ATP or
luciferin and noncompetitive inhibition of luciferase; inhibition
was not relieved at even high (mM) concentrations of both
substrates. This mechanism of action against ﬁreﬂy luciferase
was also found for resveratrol, a compound with activity against
SIRT1 among other effects.10
Although true inhibition of the enzyme reaction through
substrate-competitive mechanisms is likely for compounds in
which the inhibition can be modulated by variation of substrate
concentrations (e.g., the benzthiazolines, which act as luciferin
antagonists), nonspeciﬁc compound effects on luciferase through
mechanisms such as aggregation39,40 could lead to pseudoin-
hibition of the enzyme. However, mitigating against this
possibility, minimal or no activity was found for most of these
apparent noncompetitive inhibitors by using the P. pennsyl-
Vanica ﬁreﬂy reagent cocktail and the R. reniformis luciferase,
suggesting speciﬁc inhibition of P. pyralis luciferase. The
presence of 0.01% Tween 20 in the luciferase assay buffer used
in our qHTS also implies that compound aggregation is not a
predominant mechanism for the luciferase inhibitors identiﬁed
here, as does the fact that these compounds were often active
in reporter gene assays using BrightGlo and SteadyGlo reagents
where high (∼0.1%) concentrations of detergents such as Triton
X-100 are present. Finally, cross-proﬁling of this luciferase data
set versus a qHTS designed to detect detergent-sensitive
promiscuous inhibitors39 conﬁrmed that the compounds dis-
cussed here were distinct from those classiﬁed as aggregation-
based. The database established here should be useful in ﬂagging
these types of compounds that will be an issue in HTS, because
their inhibition persists even at high substrate concentrations.
Although compound interference based on such nonspeciﬁc
interactions as aggregation have been described in detail,39,40
many other causes of assay-related (as opposed to the desired
target-related) HTS actives exist, such as ﬂuorescent interference
or inhibition of a speciﬁc assay component such as the luciferase
enzyme described here. The luciferase proﬁle presented here is
one of several library characterizations that the NCGC has
performed on our publicly available compound collection. We
have previously proﬁled the library for ﬂuorescence20 and
aggregation39 properties, among others. The amount of activity
that we observed for luciferase inhibition (3% of the library) is
comparable to interferences obtained by other means, such as
ﬂuorescent compound interference. These modes of inhibition
can greatly overshadow the actives of interest, which typically
represent ∼0.1% of the library. For example, in a pyruvate-
kinase-luciferase-coupled assay,11 we noted that more than half
of the actives were luciferase inhibitors. The luciferase data set
is currently being used to provide a full description of the SAR
between these two purine-dependent enzymes. Such detailed
descriptions of the chemotypes capable of interfering with
common reporters are urgently needed, particularly because
public HTS databases grow in size and structural scope. The
luciferase data set described here will serve as a useful counter-
screen for future luciferase-based HTS assays.
