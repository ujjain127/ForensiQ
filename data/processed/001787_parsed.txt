Current Intelligence Bulletins (CIBs) are issued by
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH), Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia,
to
disseminate
new
scientific
information
about
occupational hazards. A CIB may draw attention to a
formerly unrecognized hazard, report new data on a
known hazard, or disseminate information on hazard
control.
CIBs are distributed to representatives of academia,
industry, organized labor, public health agencies, and
public interest groups, as well as to Federal agencies
responsible for ensuring the safety and health of workers.

We welcome suggestions concerning the

The purpose of this bulletin is to disseminate
information about the potential risk of cancer to workers
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
In
1964, the Surgeon General issued the first report on
smoking and health, which concluded that cigarette
smoking causes lung cancer. Since then, research on the
toxicity and carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke has
demonstrated that the health risk from inhaling tobacco
smoke is not limited to the smoker, but also includes
those who inhale ETS. ETS contains many of the toxic
agents and carcinogens that are present in mainstream
smoke, but in diluted form.
Recent epidemiologic
studies support and reinforce earlier published reviews
by the Surgeon General and the National Research
Council demonstrating that exposure to ETS can cause
lung cancer. These reviews estimated the relative risk of
lung cancer to be approximately 1.3 for a nonsmoker
living with a smoker compared with a nonsmoker living
with a nonsmoker.
In addition, recent evidence also
suggests a possible association between exposure to ETS
and an increased risk of heart disease in nonsmokers.

[Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1990].
NIOSH therefore considers ETS to be a potential
occupational carcinogen and recommends that exposures
be reduced to the lowest feasible concentration.
All

ABSTRACT
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) has determined that environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) is potentially carcinogenic to
occupationally exposed workers. In 1964, the Surgeon
General issued the first report on smoking and health,
which concluded that cigarette smoke causes lung
cancer.
Since then, research on the toxicity and
carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke has demonstrated that
the health risk from inhaling tobacco smoke is not
limited to the smoker, but also includes those who inhale
ETS.
ETS contains many of the toxic agents and
carcinogens that are present in mainstream smoke, but in
diluted form. Recent epidemiologic studies support and
reinforce earlier published reviews by the Surgeon
General
and
the
National
Research
Council
demonstrating that exposure to ETS can cause lung
cancer. These reviews estimated the relative risk of lung
cancer to be approximately 1.3 for a nonsmoker living
with a smoker compared with a nonsmoker living with
a nonsmoker.
In addition, recent evidence suggests a
possible association between exposure of nonsmokers to
ETS and an increased risk of heart disease.
Although these data were not gathered in an
occupational setting, ETS meets the criteria of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
for classifying substances as potential occupational
carcinogens
[Title
29
of
the
Code
of
Federal
Regulations, Part 1990]. NIOSH therefore recommends
that ETS be regarded as a potential occupational
carcinogen in conformance with the OSHA carcinogen
policy, and that exposures to ETS be reduced to the
lowest
feasible
concentration.
Employers
should
minimize occupational exposure to ETS by using all
available preventive measures.

INTRODUCTION
The Surgeon General has concluded that tobacco
smoke is a carcinogen and an important risk factor for
heart disease.
The purpose of this bulletin is to
disseminate
information
about
the
potential
carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco smoke1 (ETS)
in the workplace. Evidence is now clear that the health
risk from inhaling tobacco smoke is not limited to the
smoker, but also includes those who inhale ETS. Recent
epidemiologic studies of nonsmokers exposed to ETS
have shown an increased relative risk for lung cancer
compared with unexposed nonsmokers.
In addition,
recent evidence suggests that exposure of nonsmokers to
ETS may be associated with an increased risk of heart
disease.
This
bulletin
describes
the
results
and
implications of these studies.
The
conclusions
and
recommendations
in
this
Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) are based on the
following:
Reports of the Surgeon General on the health effects
of tobacco smoke
Comparison of the chemical composition of ETS
with that of mainstream smoke2 (MS).
Results
from
recent
epidemiologic
studies
of
nonsmokers exposed to ETS
Methods for controlling involuntary exposures to
ETS in the workplace are also discussed.
REPORTS OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ON
THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOBACCO
SMOKE
In 1964, the Surgeon General issued the first report
on smoking and health, which concluded that cigarette
smoke causes cancer [DHEW 1964]:
Cigarette smoking is causally related to lung
cancer in men; the magnitude of the
effect
of cigarette smoking far outweighs all other
factors.
The data for women, though less
extensive, point in the same direction.... The risk
of
developing
lung
cancer
increases
with
CIB 54: Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace
Page 3
duration
of
smoking
and
the
number
of
cigarettes smoked per day, and is diminished by
discontinuing smoking.
Since 1964, evidence has continued to support the
causal relationship between exposure to cigarette smoke
and lung cancer, demonstrating that risk increases with
amount and duration of smoking. Subsequent research
has increased our knowledge about the toxicity and
carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke and the risks of
exposure. Additional support for the Surgeon General’s
conclusion has come from (1) animal studies that
demonstrated the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke
condensate, and (2) analytical studies demonstrating that
tobacco smoke contains carcinogens [DHEW 1972;
DHHS 1982]. Cigarette smoking is the major cause of
lung cancer (87% of lung cancer deaths) and is estimated
to account for 30% of all cancer deaths [DHHS 1989].
The 1964 Surgeon General’s report also pointed out
that male cigarette smokers have higher death rates from
heart disease than nonsmokers. Subsequent reports have
concluded that cigarette smoking is a major cause of
heart disease and that smoking is a major independent
risk factor for heart attack [DHEW 1968; DHHS 1983].
On July 1, 1965, Congress approved the Federal
Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 (Public
Use 89-92).
This law, which became effective on
January 1, 1966, was the first of a continuing series of
Federal statutes enacting warning labels to inform the
public about the health hazards of smoking and,
subsequently,
the
use
of
other
tobacco
products.
Presently, the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act
(Public Law 98-474) [Title 15, SS 1331 of the U.S.
Code] requires cigarette companies to rotate four health
warnings on all cigarette packages and in advertisements.
COMPARISON OF THE CHEMICAL
COMPOSITION OF ETS AND MS
ETS
contains
many
of
the
toxic
agents
and
carcinogens that are present in MS, but in diluted form
[DHHS 1986]. The major source of ETS is sidestream
smoke3 (SS), which contains higher amounts of some
toxic and carcinogenic agents than MS when it is
obtained
in
its
undiluted
form
under
laboratory
conditions [DHHS 1989]. For example, the release of
volatile N-nitrosamines and aromatic amines is higher in
SS than in MS.
A major reason that undiluted SS and MS have
different concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic agents
is that peak temperatures in the burning cone of a
cigarette reach 800 to 900°C during puffing, but only
600°C
between
puffs,
resulting
in
less
complete
combustion of tobacco during generation of SS.
In
addition, most of the burning cone is oxygen deficient
during smoldering and produces a strongly reducing
environment [NRC 1986].
Table 1 lists 26 toxic and
carcinogenic agents identified in SS and MS.
ETS is diluted in the air before it is inhaled and thus
is less concentrated than MS. However, active inhalation
of MS is limited to the time it takes to smoke each
cigarette, whereas exposure to ETS is constant over the
period spent in the ETS-polluted environment. This fact
is reflected in measurements of nicotine uptake by
smokers and ETS-exposed nonsmokers [DHHS 1989].
POTENTIAL FOR OCCUPATIONAL
EXPOSURE
Approximately 29% of the U.S. adult population
smokes cigarettes, and exposure to ETS is common
[DHHS 1989]. Many people who report no exposure to
ETS have low concentrations of cotinine (a metabolite of
nicotine) in their urine, indicating exposure.
The
average concentration of cotinine in the urine of
nonsmokers has been reported to be approximately 8
ng/ml compared with approximately 1,200 ng/ml in
smokers [Cummings et al. 1990]. The National Research
Council (NRC) estimated that nonsmokers exposed to
ETS averaged 25 ng of cotinine/ml, and active smokers
averaged
1,825
ng/ml
[NRC
1986].
Husgafvel-
Pursiainen et al.
[1987] found that nonsmoking
restaurant workers had an average urinary cotinine
concentration of 56 ng/ml, and nonsmokers not exposed
to ETS had an average concentration of 8.3 ng/ml.
Other investigators have shown that nonsmokers living
with smokers have approximately two to three times the
amount of urinary cotinine as nonsmokers living with
nonsmokers [Haley et al. 1989].
Exposures to ETS were measured by respirable
suspended particulates (<2.5 pm) and averaged 242
pg/m3 in public access buildings [First 1984; NRC 1986;
Repace and Lowrey 1980, 1982]. Studies reviewed by
Repace and Lowrey [1990] suggested a 62% probability
of exposure to ETS for a nonsmoker in the workplace.
However, the relative contribution of work versus home
environments in ETS exposure has not been well
quantified.
In addition, social settings outside the
workplace or the home (e.g., restaurants and bowling
alleys) may contribute significantly to ETS exposure.

On the basis of urinary cotinine concentrations, the
NRC [1986] concluded that nonsmokers exposed to ETS
absorb the equivalent of 0.1 to 1.0 cigarette per day. On
the basis of 1985 data, NIOSH estimates that each
cigarette smoker in the United States smokes an average
of about 21 cigarettes per day [NCHS 1988]. Blood and
urine samples analyzed for vapor phase nicotine indicate
that nonsmokers exposed to ETS absorb about 1% of the
tobacco combustion products absorbed by active smokers
[NRC 1986; DHHS 1986].
EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF
NONSMOKERS EXPOSED TO ETS
Lung Cancer
Surgeon General
The Surgeon General first addressed the possible
health effects of involuntary smoking in 1972 [DHEW
1972]. Evidence associating adverse health effects with
ETS exposure continued to be reported, and in 1986, the
Surgeon
General’s
report
entitled
The
Health
Consequences of Involuntary Smoking focused entirely
on this subject [DHHS 1986]. This report cited 3 cohort
CIB 54: Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace
Page 5
studies
and
10
case-control
studies
that
together
documented an approximately 1.3-fold increase in the
risk of lung cancer among nonsmoking women, usually
wives exposed to their husbands’ ETS.
The 1986
Surgeon General’s report concluded that involuntary
smoking is a cause of disease (including lung cancer) in
healthy nonsmokers; however, more data on the dose and
distribution of ETS exposure in the population are
needed to accurately estimate the magnitude of risk in
the U.S. population [DHHS 1986].
NRC [1986]
The NRC also reviewed the important epidemiologic
data available in 1986 (3 cohort studies and 10 case-
control studies) on the adverse health effects of ETS
exposure. These studies were the same ones reviewed
by the Surgeon General, except for one case-control
study.
The statistical power of a single study is often
small, but it can be improved by analyzing all the data
simultaneously across all studies (meta-analysis). Using
this approach, the NRC estimated that the relative risk
for nonsmokers married to smokers was 1.25 compared
with nonsmokers married to nonsmokers, taking into
account the possible misclassification of smokers as
nonsmokers. Using data from urinary cotinine tests to
estimate the extent of ETS exposure, the NRC also
estimated that the relative risk of lung cancer for
nonsmokers exposed to ETS at home, at work, or
elsewhere
was
1.42
compared
with
unexposed
nonsmokers, with a plausible range of 1.24 to 1.61. The
NRC concluded that "the weight of the evidence derived
from epidemiologic studies shows an association between
ETS exposure of nonsmokers and lung cancer that, taken
as a whole, is unlikely to be due to chance or systematic
bias."
Wald et al. [1986]
In another quantitative meta-analysis covering the
same studies reviewed by the NRC, Wald et al. [1986]
reached similar conclusions.
Their analysis showed a
30% greater risk of lung cancer (relative risk 1.30) for
nonsmokers living with smokers relative to nonsmokers
living with nonsmokers. The authors concluded that this
result was unlikely to have occurred by chance and that
it underestimated the true risk associated with exposure
to ETS because nonsmokers living with nonsmokers are
exposed to ETS in other settings (e.g., at work).
The
relative risk is thus based on a reference group that is
partially exposed.
Blot and Fraumeni [1986]
Blot and Fraumeni [1986] analyzed the same studies
reviewed by the Surgeon General and the NRC except
for one case-control study. Combining data across the
reviewed studies, these investigators concluded that the
overall relative risk for nonsmoking women married to
husbands who smoked was 1.3 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.1- 1.5) compared with nonsmoking women
married to nonsmokers. These authors also concluded
that the relative risk for nonsmokers exposed to heavy
smoking was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.1). They found that the
epidemiologic studies strongly suggested an increased
risk that was biologically plausible, but that limitations
in assessing ETS exposure had introduced uncertainty.
Eight additional studies of lung cancer and ETS
exposure among those who never smoked have been
published since the reviews by the Surgeon General
[DHHS 1986; NRC 1986; Wald et al. 1986; Blot and
Fraumeni 1986] (Table 2).
Hole et al. [1989]
Hole et al. [1989] updated an earlier cohort study
[Gillis et al. 1984] of 3,960 men and 4,037 women in
Scotland. These men and women had lived in the same
households and had been followed for an average of 11.5
years. They were aged 45-64 at the time of the original
interviews, which took place from 1972 to 1976. The
unexposed group was defined as persons who never
smoked and lived with nonsmokers at the time of
interview. The exposed group was composed of persons
who never smoked and lived with smokers.
A third
group was composed of persons who had smoked during
some period in the past. In the followup study [Hole et
al. 1989], only 2 deaths from lung cancer occurred in the
unexposed group and 7 in the exposed group, compared
with 147 deaths from lung cancer among smokers. The
adjusted relative risk for the exposed group was 2.41
(95% CI, 0.45-12.83), compared with a relative risk of
10.64 for persons who had smoked in the past. The risk
for smokers was the same whether or not they were
exposed to ETS.
Brownson et al. [1987]
Brownson et al. [1987] conducted a case-control
study of persons diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the
lung. A subset of 19 nonsmoking women was identified
from this group and was compared with 47 controls.
Exposure to ETS was classified as less than 4 hr/day or
more than 4 hr/day (there was no specification of when
this exposure occurred).
The odds ratio for those
exposed more than 4 hr/day was 1.68 (95% CI,

odds ratio for those exposed fewer than 4 hr/day was
1.00. The study does not state whether the nonsmoking
females had ever smoked, but the implication is that they
had never smoked. Because many of the subjects were
deceased, smoking status was often determined from
interviews with next of kin. The study lacked sufficient
sample size to draw substantive conclusions, but it did
suggest an increased risk for adenocarcinoma among
nonsmokers exposed to ETS.
Humble et al. [1987]
Humble et al. [1987] evaluated the risk of lung
cancer in a case-control study of 28 lung cancer patients
who never smoked and lived with a smoking spouse
compared with a control group of 54 persons who never
smoked and lived with a nonsmoking spouse. Surrogate
responses about smoking habits were used for 19 of the
28 cases, with most of these data provided by the
spouse.
The adjusted odds ratio for nonsmokers living
with a spouse who smoked cigarettes was 2.2 (90% CI,
1.0-4.9),
and
it
was
2.6
(90%
CI,
1.2-5.6)
for
nonsmokers exposed to any type of ETS (including pipes
and cigars). There was no trend of increasing risk with
increased duration of exposure or increased amount
regularly smoked by the spouse. In addition, marriage
to a smoker did not increase the risk for persons who
had ever smoked.
This study contained no data on
exposure to ETS outside the home or from other persons
(nonspouses) living in the home.

Gao et al. [1987]
Gao et al. [1987] studied 672 female lung cancer
patients and 735 population-based controls in Shanghai,
China.
Patients had been diagnosed as having lung
cancer between 1984 and 1986, and both patients and
controls were all interviewed directly.
The odds ratio
(adjusted for age and education) was 0.9 (95% CI,
0.6-1.4) for persons who had ever lived with a smoker
during adulthood, and 1. 1 (95% CI, 0.7-1.7) for those
who had ever lived with a smoker during childhood.
However, for 246 married patients and 375 married
controls, risk increased with increasing years of marriage
to a spouse who smoked, reaching 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0-2.9)
among nonsmokers who lived with a smoker for more
than 40 years.
Lam et al. [1987]
Lam et al. [1987] studied 445 female lung cancer
patients in Hong Kong matched by age with 445 female
controls
from
the
same
neighborhood.
Analyses
(unmatched) for exposure to ETS included 199 married
patients and 335 married controls who never smoked. A
small number of persons who were not married and
never smoked (5% to 6% of the patients and controls)
were also included and treated as unexposed to ETS.
Wives exposed to ETS from a husband who smoked had
an odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.16-2.35), with the
predominant type of cancer being adenocarcinoma (odds
ratio 2.12). These odds ratios were not adjusted for any
confounders.
Janerich et al. [1990]
Janerich et al. [1990] conducted a population-based
case-control study of 191 persons who never smoked and
were diagnosed with lung cancer from 1982 to 1984; this
group was compared with individually matched controls
who never smoked. Controls were matched by age, sex,
and county of residence.
Surrogate interviews were
necessary for 62 cases and thus were also conducted for
their matched controls.
The number of years of
exposure to ETS in the home was calculated by
summing the number of smokers in the home per year
across all years of life. The number of years exposed to
ETS outside the home was also estimated, although
details were not given in the report.
Childhood and
adolescent exposures in the home, adult exposures in the
home,
and adult exposures outside the home all
contributed about equally to total lifetime exposure to
ETS. For spouses, ETS exposure was also calculated by
multiplying the number of packs smoked per day by the
number of years the spouse smoked. The major finding
of the study was a trend of increasing lung cancer risk
with increasing years of exposure during childhood.
Household exposure to ETS for 25 or more years that
included childhood doubled the risk of lung cancer (odds
ratio, 2.07; 95 % CI, 1.16-3.68). No consistent increase
in
cancer risk
occurred with increasing
years
of
adulthood exposure to all sources of ETS, but persons
exposed for the greatest number of years showed the
highest risk (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.56-2.20).
Separate analyses of exposure to ETS from spousal
smoking found no excess risk of lung cancer for
individuals married to smokers, and no
trend
of
increased risk with increased years of exposure or with
increased amount smoked by the spouse. Odds ratios in
this study were not adjusted for any confounders, and
odds ratios for exposure to ETS from spousal smoking
do not appear to have been adjusted for childhood ETS
exposures.
Shimizu et al. [1988]
Shimizu et al. [1988] published a case-control study
of 90 female lung cancer patients who never smoked.
Each
patient
was
matched
by
age,
hospital,
and
admission date to 2 controls of the same sex who did not
have lung cancer (for 17 patients, only 1 control was
used).
Information was gathered about occupation,
exposure to ETS, diet, and cooking fuels. The risk of
lung cancer was significantly elevated for women who
never smoked and lived in a home where the mother
smoked (relative risk, 4.0; P<0.05) or the paternal
grandfather smoked (relative risk, 3.2; P<0.05). Exposure
to the ETS of other household members (including the
husband, the father, and the children) was not associated
with increased risk.
The relative risk for exposure to
ETS at work was 1.2. The authors found no increasing
trend in risk with the number of cigarettes smoked by
the mother or the paternal grandfather.
However, the
authors indicated that the subjects had trouble recalling
the amount of smoking to which they had been exposed.
The authors also pointed out that in Japan, children
spend considerable time with their mother in the home,
and less with the father; it is also common for the retired
father of the husband to live in his son’s home.

The authors reported a
significantly elevated odds ratio for the patients exposed
to ETS from spouses (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% CI,
1.03-4.53), but it is not clear whether these women
included former smokers. Their risk increased with the
amount and duration (years) of the husband’s smoking.

Summary
of
Results
from
Lung
Cancer
Studies
The studies published since 1986 have concentrated
on ETS exposure through spousal smoking during
adulthood [Hole et al. 1989; Brownson et al. 1987;
Humble et al. 1987; Gao et al. 1987; Lam et al. 1987;
Janerich et al. 1990; Shimizu et al. 1988; Geng et al.
1988], although some studies include data on childhood
exposures [Janerich et al. 1990; Shimizu et al. 1988; Gao
et al. 1987]. The data from these more recent studies do
not individually demonstrate a clear causal relationship
between ETS exposure and lung cancer, but their
consistent finding of a relative risk greater than 1.0 for
nonsmokers exposed to ETS provides evidence of a
positive association. These data are consistent with and
reinforce the reviews by NRC [1986], DHHS [1986],
Blot and Fraumeni [1986], and Wald et al. [ 1986], all
of which concluded that ETS exposure is associated with
an increased risk of lung cancer for nonsmokers.
The most important limitation observed in all studies
reporting lung cancer risks among persons who never
smoked is the lack of quantitative ETS exposure data.
Most
studies
have
defined
exposure
to
ETS
for
nonsmokers on the basis of living with or being married
to a smoker. All of the case-control studies ascertained
the potential for exposure by interviewing subjects and
controls (or surrogates) without any other independent
assessment of ETS exposure. Questionnaires often failed
to include specific questions about afl sources of ETS.
Most studies included limited or no information about
the risk of lung cancer from ETS exposure in the
workplace.
The potential exists for a positive bias, particularly
in the case-control studies, where ex-smokers with lung
cancer might have been misclassified as never having
smoked. The misclassified ex-smokers are more likely
to be married to smokers and to develop lung cancer
than those who never smoked.
However, the NRC
[1986] estimated that the effect of such misclassification
would have been relatively slight and could not entirely
account for the increased risk of lung cancer following
exposure to ETS. This conclusion by the NRC is based
on calculations that assume a degree of misclassification
CIB 54: Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace
Page 9
(based on nonsmoker urinary cotinine data) and its likely
effect on the observed lung cancer risk. In addition, the
risk of lung cancer in these studies is based on a
reference group of nonsmokers living with nonsmokers
who are exposed to ETS in other settings.
This
background exposure results in underestimation of the
true risk.
Several risk assessments have been performed for
persons who never smoked and were exposed to ETS.
The NRC [1986] estimated that of the 7,000 lung cancer
deaths reported in 1985 among U.S. women who never
smoked, 2,010 (29%) were attributable to ETS.
The
corresponding number for men was 820 (16%) of the
5,200 lung cancer deaths among U.S. males who never
smoked.
Wells [1988] estimated that approximately
3,000 of the lung cancer deaths reported in 1985 among
persons who never smoked occurred as a result of ETS
exposure.
Repace and Lowrey [1990] estimated that
approximately 5,000 of the lung cancer deaths reported
in 1988 among persons who never smoked and ex-
smokers occurred as a result of ETS exposure.
These
risk assessments used a 1.3 to 1.5 relative risk of lung
cancer for nonsmokers exposed to ETS at home or
elsewhere compared with unexposed persons.
The
number of deaths attributable to ETS exposure was
derived using standard formulas for attributable risks
[Kleinbaum et al. 1983] with the estimated number of
annual lung cancer deaths in the United States for
persons who have never smoked.
Heart Disease
Surgeon General
The Surgeon General [DHHS 1986] reviewed four
epidemiologic
studies of cardiovascular
disease in
persons exposed to ETS [Lee et al. 1986; Hirayama
1984; Gillis et al. 1984; Garland et al. 1985] (Table 3).
He concluded that further studies on the relationship
between involuntary smoking and cardiovascular disease
are needed in order to determine whether involuntary
smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
More detailed characterizations of exposure to ETS and
specific types of cardiovascular disease associated with
this exposure are needed before an effect of involuntary
smoking on the etiology of cardiovascular disease can be
established.
NRC [1986]
The NRC [1986] reviewed four epidemiologic
studies that evaluated the association between heart
disease and ETS exposure [Garland et al. 1985; Gillis et
al. 1984; Hirayama 1984; Svendsen et al. 1985, 19874]
(Table 3). The same NRC review examined studies of
the effects of ETS exposure on heart rate and blood
pressure among healthy individuals.
No statistically
significant increases were found in heart disease or
effects on heart rate and blood pressure.
The NRC
report
concluded
that
with
respect
to
chronic
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality,
although
biologically plausible, there is no evidence of statistically
significant effects due to ETS exposure, apart from the
study by Hirayama (see Table 3) in Japan."
Other Epidemiologic and Experimental Studies
Since publication of the reports by the NRC and the
Surgeon
General,
researchers
have
published
two
epidemiologic studies of heart disease and ETS exposure
[Humble et al. 1990; Helsing et al. 1988], and one
update [Hole et al. 1989] of an earlier cohort study
[Gillis et al. 1984] (Table 3). Experimental studies of
the effects of ETS on the heart have also been published
[Davis et al. 1989; Allred et al. 1989; Sheps et al. 1990].
The studies reported by Hole et al. [1989], Helsing
et al. [1988], and Humble et al. [1990] associated ETS
exposure with an increase of heart disease among
persons who never smoked. The studies by Hole et al.
[1989] and Helsing et al. [1988] are both large follow-up
cohort studies that used direct interviews of men and
women who lived in the same household. Study of these
cohorts demonstrated an excess of heart disease in
persons who lived with smokers and never smoked
compared with persons who lived with nonsmokers and
never smoked.
Furthermore, Hole et al. [1989] and
Humble et al. [1990] show an increasing risk for heart
disease mortality with increasing exposure to ETS at
home.
Helsing et al. [1988] found a similar trend in
women but not men.
Experimental studies support the hypothesis that ETS
exposure has deleterious effects on platelets and the
endothelium [Davis et al. 1989] and can decrease the
time to onset of angina pectoris in patients with coronary
artery disease [Allred et al. 1989]. Allred et al. [1989]
reported that the time to angina decreased in heart
disease patients who exercised after exposure to airborne
carbon monoxide (CO) at concentrations producing 2%
and 3.9% carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in the blood.
Sheps et al. [1990] observed that arrhythmias in heart
disease patients increased when they exercised after
exposure to airborne CO at concentrations producing 6%
COHB in the blood.
Persons exposed to ETS in
unventilated areas have been shown to have COHB
concentrations of 2% to 3% [NRC 1986].
CIB 54: Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace
Page 10
Wells [1988] estimated that among nonsmokers in
the United States, 32,000 deaths from heart disease each
year were attributable to ETS exposure.
Wells used
estimated rates for death from heart disease among
nonsmokers and a relative risk of 1.30 for ETS-exposed
nonsmokers compared with unexposed nonsmokers.
Glantz and Parmley [1991] recently reviewed the
epidemiologic literature on exposure to ETS and heart
disease (including the studies in Table 3) from 1984 to
the present. These researchers estimated a 30% increase
(relative risk, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4) in the risk of death
from ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction in
nonsmoking individuals exposed to ETS at home.
Glantz and Parmley also noted that several of these
studies found a dose-response relation between the
amount of smoking by the spouse and the risk of heart
disease in the nonsmoking spouse; they concluded that
exposure to ETS can cause heart disease.
Summary of Results from
Heart Disease Studies
The principal limitation found in the lung cancer
studies also applies to the studies of heart disease in
persons exposed to ETS-that is, the indirect method of
assessing exposure to ETS (usually defined as spousal
smoking). The second limitation of these heart disease
studies is the difficulty in controlling for all known
cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, and body mass index). In addition, the risk
of heart disease for ETS-exposed persons who never
smoked seems large compared with the risk of heart
disease for smokers.
Unlike lung cancer mortality,
where the relative risk for smokers compared with
nonsmokers is 22.4 for men and 11.9 for women, the
relative risk of heart disease mortality for smokers
compared with nonsmokers is 1.9 for men and 1.8 for
women [DHHS 1989].
Note that the nonsmoking
comparison group for these risk estimates includes those
exposed to ETS.
Other Adverse Health Effects
Several additional adverse health effects have been
associated with ETS exposure, including cervical cancer
[Slattery et al. 1989], ischemic stroke [Donnan et al.
1989], spontaneous abortion [Ahlborg 1990], and low
birthweight
[NRC
1986].
However,
evidence
is
insufficient to draw conclusions about the relationship of
ETS exposure to these health effects.
CONCLUSIONS
In 1964 the Surgeon General concluded that cigarette
smoke Causes lung cancer. Since that time, additional
research on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of tobacco
smoke has demonstrated that the health risks from
inhaling tobacco smoke are not limited to smokers, but
also include those who inhale ETS. ETS contains many
of the toxic agents and carcinogens found in MS, but in
diluted form. Recent epidemiologic studies support and
reinforce the conclusions of the reviews by the Surgeon
General and the NRC demonstrating that exposure to
ETS can cause lung cancer. These reviews estimated the
relative risk for lung cancer to be approximately 1.3 for
nonsmokers
living
with
smokers
compared
with
nonsmokers living with nonsmokers. In addition, recent
evidence also suggests a possible association between
exposure to ETS and an increased risk for
heart disease in nonsmokers. The recent epidemiologic
studies (including those associating ETS with other
adverse health effects) point to a pattern of health effects
that is similar for both smokers and nonsmokers exposed
to ETS.
NIOSH recognizes that these recent epidemiologic
studies have several shortcomings: lack of objective
measures for characterizing and quantifying exposures,
failure to adjust for all confounding variables, potential
misclassification
of
ex-smokers
as
nonsmokers,
unavailability of comparison groups that have not been
exposed to ETS, and low statistical power. Nonetheless,
NIOSH has determined that the collective weight of
evidence (i.e., that from the Surgeon General’s reports,
the similarities in composition of MS and ETS, and the
recent epidemiologic studies) is sufficient to conclude
that ETS poses an increased risk of lung cancer and
possibly heart disease to occupationally exposed workers.
The epidemiologic data are not sufficient to draw
conclusions about other health effects such as cervical
cancer, ischemic stroke, spontaneous abortion, and low
birthweight.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Several systems exist for classifying a substance as
a carcinogen.
Such classification systems have been
developed by NTP [1989], IARC [1987], and OSHA [29
CFR 1990]. NIOSH considers the OSHA classification
system (Identification, Classification, and Regulation of
Potential Occupational Carcinogens [29 CFR 1990], also
known as the OSHA carcinogen policy) the most
appropriate
for
use
in
identifying
occupational
carcinogens5. The Surgeon General has concluded that
cigarette smoke causes lung cancer as well as heart
disease.

carcinogens,
cocarcinogens,
and
tumor
promoters
identified as components of ETS and MS in analytical
studies. Furthermore, a large body of evidence indicates
that exposure to ETS has produced lung cancer in
nonsmokers.
NIOSH therefore considers ETS to be a
potential occupational carcinogen in conformance with
the OSHA carcinogen policy [29 CFR 1990].
The risk of developing cancer should be decreased
by minimizing exposure to ETS.
Employers should
therefore assess conditions that may result in worker
exposure to ETS and take steps to reduce exposures to
the lowest feasible concentration.
METHODS FOR CONTROLLING
INVOLUNTARY EXPOSURE TO ETS
Workers should not be involuntarily exposed to
tobacco smoke.
To prevent worker exposures to any
hazardous substance, employers should first eliminate
hazardous workplace emissions at their source.
If
elimination is not possible, emissions should be removed
from the pathway between the source and the worker
[NIOSH
1983].
Therefore,
the
best
method
for
controlling worker exposure to ETS is to eliminate
tobacco use from the workplace and to implement a
smoking cessation program.
Until tobacco use can be
completely
eliminated,
employers
should
protect
nonsmokers from ETS by isolating smokers. Methods
for eliminating tobacco use from the workplace and
isolating smokers are described here briefly.
Eliminating Tobacco Use from the Workplace
Worker exposure to ETS is most efficiently and
completely controlled by simply eliminating tobacco use
from the workplace. To facilitate elimination of tobacco
use, employers should implement smoking cessation
programs. The Association of Schools of Public Health
(ASPH) has recommended the following strategy for
smoking
cessation
[NIOSH
1986].
Specifically,
management and labor should work together to develop
appropriate nonsmoking policies that include some or all
of the following:
Prohibit smoking at the workplace and provide
sufficient disincentives for those who do not comply
Distribute information about health promotion and
the harmful effects of smoking
Offer smoking-cessation classes to all workers
Establish incentives to encourage workers to stop
smoking
Further information regarding workplace smoking
policies and smoking cessation programs can be found in
No Smoking: A Decision Maker’s Guide to Reducing
Smoking at the Worksite [American Cancer Society et
al. 1985].
Isolating Smokers
The 1986 Surgeon General’s report on involuntary
smoking concluded that, the simple separation of
smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace may
reduce,
but
does
not
eliminate,
the
exposure
of
nonsmokers to ETS."
In indoor workplaces where
smoking is permitted, ETS can spread throughout the
airspace of all workers. The most direct and effective
method of eliminating ETS from the workplace is to
prohibit smoking in the workplace.
Until that is
achieved, employers can designate separate, enclosed
areas for smoking, with separate ventilation. Air from
this area should be exhausted directly outside and not
recirculated within the building or mixed with the
general dilution ventilation for the building. Ventilation
of the smoking area should meet general ventilation
standards, and the smoking area should have slight
negative pressure to ensure airflow into the area rather
than back into the airspace of the workplace [ASHRAE
1989]. Guidance for designing local exhaust ventilation
systems can be found in Recommended Industrial
Ventilation Guidelines [Hagopian and Bastress 1976],
Industrial
Ventilation-A
Manual
of
Recommended
Practice [ACGIH 1986], and Fundamentals Governing
the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems
[ANSI 1979].
Warning signs should be posted at the entrances to
the workplace in both English and the predominant
language of non-English-reading workers. These signs
should state that smoking is prohibited or permitted only
in designated smoking areas.
If designated smoking
areas are provided, they should be clearly identified by
signs.
RESEARCH NEEDS
Research is needed to investigate the following issues:
More accurate quantification of the increased risk of
lung cancer associated with ETS exposure, including
determination of other contributing factors (e.g.,
occupational exposures) that may accentuate the risk.
Determination of the concentration and distribution
of ETS components in the
workplace to help
quantify the risk for the U.S. working population.
The association of ETS exposure with cancer other
than lung cancer.

APPENDIX POSITIONS OF OTHER
AGENCIES REGARDING ETS
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration
(MSHA) have not established permissible exposure limits
(PEU) for ETS in the workplace.
OSHA is now
preparing to address this issue as part of an indoor air
quality standard.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
states that ETS is a known cause of lung cancer and
respiratory symptoms and that it has been linked to heart
disease. EPA also recommends that exposure to ETS be
minimized wherever possible by restricting smoking to
separately ventilated areas directly exhausted to the
outside, or by entirely eliminating smoking in buildings
[EPA 1989].
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
[IARC 1986] stated that epidemiologic studies have
demonstrated an increased risk of lung cancer for
nonsmoking spouses of smokers. Although researchers
had substantial difficulty in determining exposure to ETS
and other risk factors for the cancers studied, IARC
concluded that passive smoking gives rise to some risk
of cancer. IARC also concluded that there is sufficient
evidence that tobacco smoke is carcinogenic to humans,"
and that there is sufficient evidence that inhalation of
tobacco smoke as well as topical application of tobacco
smoke condensate cause cancer in experimental animals."

"’Potential occupational carcinogen’ means any substance, or combination or mixture of substances, which causes an increased
incidence of benign and/or malignant neoplasms, or a substantial decrease in the latency period between exposure and onset
of neoplasms in humans or in one or more experimental mammalian species as the result of any oral, respiratory or dermal
exposure, or any other exposure which results in the induction of tumors at a site other than the site of administration. This
definition also includes any substance which is metabolized into one or more potential occupational carcinogens by mammals"
[29 CFR 1990.103].
