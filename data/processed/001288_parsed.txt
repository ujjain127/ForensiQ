Abstract
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) plants were grown in ﬁeld plots at the current ambient [CO2], and at ambient
+ 300 and ambient + 600 µmol mol−1 [CO2]. Approximately weekly measurements were made of single leaf gas
exchange of upper canopy leaves from early spring through fall of two years, in order to determine the temperature
dependence of the stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2], whether growth at elevated [CO2] resulted
in acclimation of photosynthesis, and whether any photosynthetic acclimation was reduced when fruiting created
additional demand for the products of photosynthesis. Stimulation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation by short-
term increases in [CO2] increased strongly with measurement temperature. The stimulation exceeded that predicted
from the kinetic characteristics of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphatecarboxylase at all temperatures. Acclimation of photo-
synthesis to growth at elevated [CO2] was evident from early spring through summer, including the fruiting period
in early summer, with lower rates under standard measurement conditions in plants grown at elevated [CO2]. The
degree of acclimation increased with growth [CO2]. However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between [CO2]
treatments in total nitrogen per leaf area, and photosynthetic acclimation was reversed one day after switching
the [CO2] treatments. Tests showed that acclimation did not result from a limitation of photosynthesis by triose
phosphate utilization rate at elevated [CO2]. Photosynthetic acclimation was not evident during dry periods in
midsummer, when the elevated [CO2] treatments conserved soil water and photosynthesis declined more at ambient
than at elevated [CO2]. Acclimation was also not evident during the fall, when plants were vegetative, despite
wet conditions and continued higher leaf starch content at elevated [CO2]. Stomatal conductance responded little
to short-term changes in [CO2] except during drought, and changed in parallel with photosynthetic acclimation
through the seasons in response to the long-term [CO2] treatments. The data do not support the hypothesis that
source-sink balance controls the seasonal occurrence of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated [CO2] in this
species.
Introduction
Rising atmospheric [CO2] is anticipated to stimu-
late photosynthesis of C3 plants, possibly increasing
growth and yield. However, quantitative predictions
of effects of elevated [CO2] on photosynthesis remain
uncertain for at least two reasons: variation in the
temperature dependence of the short-term response
of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2], and our cur-
rent inability to predict either the occurrence or the
magnitude of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated
[CO2].
Elevated [CO2] is expected to stimulate photosyn-
thesis more at high than at low temperatures, based on
the kinetic characteristics of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase (Long 1991; Kirschbaum 1994). While
238
this has been conﬁrmed in many cases (e.g. Sage et
al. 1995; Hikosaka et al. 1999), it has been found that
the stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2]
at cool temperatures may substantially exceed that
predicted by Rubisco kinetics in some species which
retain photosynthetically active leaves at cold times of
year, e.g. winter wheat and barley (Bunce 1998a), dan-
delion (Bunce 2000), loblolly pine (Teskey 1997), and
several cool-season pasture species (Greer et al. 1995).
We hypothesized that strawberry, which also has green
leaves at cold times of the year, would also have
greater than expected stimulation of photosynthesis by
elevated [CO2] at cool temperatures.
Acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2],
such that rates of photosynthesis are lower for plants
grown at elevated [CO2] than at lower [CO2], when all
plants are compared under the same measurement con-
ditions, is a common but not universal result. Neither
the occurrence nor the magnitude of acclimation seem
to be predictable as yet. While photosynthetic accli-
mation to elevated [CO2] sometimes occurs in crops
in fertile soil (e.g. Nie et al. 1995; Sicher and Bunce
1997, 1998), it is more common at low fertility (e.g.
Ziska et al. 1996; Isopp et al. 2000). Strawberry
is a crop commonly grown with little or no applied
fertilizer, and glasshouse experiments at low fertility
indicated such severe photosynthetic acclimation to
elevated [CO2] that photosynthesis under the growth
[CO2] measurement conditions decreased at [CO2]s
above 600 µmol mol−1 (Keutgen et al. 1997).
The fundamental cause of acclimation of photo-
synthesis to elevated [CO2] is thought to be inability
of plants to fully utilize the extra photosynthate pro-
duced (cf. Stitt and Krapp 1999). Lack of sink capacity
may result from nutrient deﬁciency, low temperature,
restricted rooting volume, or lack of a reproductive
sink. In wheat, for example, acclimation of photosyn-
thesis was more severe near the end of the season,
when seed ﬁlling was complete (Sicher and Bunce
1997; Garcia et al. 1998), and in sugar beet initial
photosynthetic acclimation disappeared when taproot
expansion provided a larger sink (Ziska et al. 1995).
One form of feedback inhibition of photosynthesis res-
ults from slow triose phosphate utilization (Sharkey
1985), and has been found to cause photosynthetic
acclimation to elevated [CO2] in beans (Socias et al.
1993) and wheat (McKee and Woodward 1994). We
hypothesized that in strawberry, photosynthetic accli-
mation to elevated [CO2] would be less during fruiting
than at other times of the year, and tested for the oc-
currence of triose phosphate utilization limitation of
photosynthesis in plants grown at elevated [CO2].
Materials and methods
Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne cv. Honeoye obtained
as rooted runners from Miller Nurseries, Canandaigua,
New York, were planted into ﬁeld plots in March 1998.
Sixteen plants were transplanted into each of six open-
topped clear acrylic chambers each of which covered
1.1 m2 of ground. Chambers were 1.8 m in height. A
blower pulled air out of each chamber at the base at
a rate of 6 m3 min−1. Carbon dioxide was introduced
into four of the chambers at the inlets of mixing fans
positioned above the canopies. Flow rates of CO2 were
such that two chambers had a [CO2] of 300 ± 50 µmol
mol−1 above that of outside air, and two chambers had
a [CO2] of 600 ± 50 µmol mol−1 above that of out-
side air, while two chambers received no supplemental
CO2. Samples of air from each [CO2] treatment were
pumped sequentially through an absolute infrared ana-
lyzer in an adjacent air-conditioned shelter, and [CO2],
air temperatures, and PPFD were logged every 5 min.
The chambers transmitted 90% of the PPFD, and had
air temperatures which averaged 1 ◦C above those of
outside air. The mean daytime [CO2] of ambient air
was 353 µmol mol−1, with concentrations at night of
400 – 600 µmol mol−1.
The soil in the plots had received no lime or fertil-
izer for four years prior to the start of the experiment,
and was not fertilized during the 28-month duration
of the experiment. This was a deliberate attempt to
have nutrients limiting to plant growth. To establish
the fact that nutrients were limiting to plant growth,
extra plants were transplanted into pots ﬁlled with soil
from the ﬁeld plot, and watered either with a com-
plete Hoagland’s solution or with water. Plants were
grown outdoors at ambient [CO2] for two months,
and the ﬁnal dry mass of the fertilized plants was 1.5
times that of the unfertilized plants. During the 28
month course of the ﬁeld experiment, the soil pH de-
creased from 5.5 to 4.9. Flower buds were removed
the ﬁrst spring after planting, but plants were allowed
to ﬂower and fruit normally the next two springs, and
fruits were picked by hand when ripe. Vegetative re-
production was allowed to proceed unimpeded, and
occurred primarily during the few weeks immediately
after fruiting, which ended in early June.
Rates of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and sto-
matal conductances of single leaves were measured
239
about weekly from early spring through late fall in
1998 and 1999, continuing through the end of fruit-
ing in June, 2000. On each measurement date, several
leaves on the same plants were measured to determine
the position of the leaf with the highest rates of gas
exchange, and leaves at similar positions were used
for all plants measured on that date. Gas exchange
measurements were made near midday on clear days,
with a photon ﬂux density of photosynthetically active
radiation of at least 1200 µmol m−2 s−1. A CIRAS-1
portable photosynthesis system (PP Systems, Haver-
hill, Massachusetts) was utilized, and incorporated
automatic [CO2] control, and a broad leaf cuvette
which kept leaf temperature within 3 ◦C of outside
air temperature even in full sunlight. For plants grown
at elevated [CO2], leaf gas exchange rates were de-
termined at the daytime growth [CO2]s of 650 or 950
µmol mol−1. Leaves of plants grown without supple-
mental CO2were measured at [CO2]s of 350, 650 and
950 µmol mol−1. Real-time display of gas exchange
data was utilized to insure that steady-state rates of
gas exchange were achieved at each measurement con-
dition. On each measurement date, three leaves were
measured from each chamber. Leaf discs were collec-
ted for determination of leaf water potential from one
leaf per chamber immediately after gas exchange was
measured. Water potentials were measured using insu-
lated C-52 samples chambers and an HR-33 dew point
meter (Wescor, Inc., Logan, Utah) which were kept
in an air conditioned shelter adjacent to the site. Soil
water potential was measured at depth of 25 cm, using
Decagon matric potential sensors and readout system
(Decagon Devices, Pulman, Washington).
On some of the dates when leaf gas exchange
measurements indicated the existence of photosyn-
thetic acclimation to elevated [CO2], photosynthetic
CO2 assimilation rates of plants grown at the highest
[CO2] were also measured at a [CO2] of 1200 µmol
mol−1 to determine if photosynthetic rates were sat-
urated for CO2 under the growth [CO2] of 950 µmol
mol−1. An increase in rate at the highest [CO2] was
taken as evidence that the rate at the growth [CO2] was
not limited by triose phosphate utilization rate.
Starch and total nitrogen per unit of leaf area were
determined on leaf samples on several of the dates
when leaf gas exchange rates were determined. For
starch analysis, leaf punches of known area were
frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 ◦C until analyzed
by the methods described in Sicher and Bunce (1999).
For N analysis, whole leaﬂets were removed and their
area determined with a portable photoelectric leaf area
meter. Leaﬂets were then frozen in liquid N2, freeze-
dried, and% N was determined by CHN analysis at
the State of Maryland Soil Testing Laboratory. Spe-
ciﬁc leaf area for each leaﬂet was used with% N to
determine the mass of nitrogen per unit of leaf area.
At the end of the experiment, the [CO2] treat-
ments were switched between one ambient and one +
600 µmol mol−1 chamber, and midday photosynthetic
CO2 assimilation rates were determined 0, 1 and 3
days after switching the treatments and compared with
rates in chambers which had not been switched. Three
leaves were measured per chamber, both at an external
[CO2] (Ca) of 350 and 950 µmol mol−1.
The short-term response of photosynthetic CO2 as-
similation rate to substomatal [CO2] (Ci) of the plants
grown without supplemental CO2 was summarized as
the relative increase in photosynthesis from a Ci = 225
µmol mol−1 to Ci = 450 µmol mol−1. These values
were chosen based on the fact that leaves measured at
the current ambient [CO2] had Ci values of 225 ± 15
µmol mol−1, and these leaves had Ci values of 450 ±
30 lmol mol−1 when measured at 650 µmol mol−1.
Photosynthesis rates at precisely Ci = 225 and 450
µmol mol−1 were estimated from a cubic spline curve
ﬁt. The observed relative increase in photosynthesis
on a given measurement date was compared with the
relative increase predicted from the kinetic character-
istics of Rubisco and the measurement temperature
(Bunce 2000), using a Farquhar-type C3 photosyn-
thesis model (Long 1991). The maximum carboxyla-
tion rate in the model was set at a value consistent
with assimilation rates measured at Ci = 225 µmol
mol−1, and the maximum rate of electron transport
was set large enough to not be limiting. The model
was also run using internal diffusive resistances to
carbon dioxide of 4 – 8 m2 s mol−1 (varying with max-
imum carboxylation rate) such that the [CO2] in the
chloroplast (Cc) was 0.7∗Ci at Ci = 225 µmol mol−1.
In testing for photosynthetic acclimation to elev-
ated [CO2], average photosynthetic CO2 assimilation
rates on each measurement date were calculated for
each chamber, and [CO2] treatments were compared
using analysis of variance, with two chambers per
treatment. Rates for plants grown and measured at +
300 µmol mol−1 were compared with rates of plants
grown at ambient [CO2] but measured at + 300, and
rates for plants grown and measured at + 600 µmol
mol−1 were compared with rates of plants grown at
ambient [CO2] but measured at + 600 µmol mol−1

Results
The relative stimulation of photosynthetic CO2 as-
similation rate from Ci = 225 to Ci = 450 µmol
mol−1 increased with measurement temperature, and
at all temperatures exceeded that predicted from Ru-
bisco kinetics (Figure 1A). When internal diffusive
resistance was added to the model, a closer ﬁt with
experimental data occurred at the higher temperatures,
but most of the experimental data still exceeded the re-
lative stimulation predicted by the model at the lower
temperatures (Figure 1A). For plants grown and meas-
ured at the current ambient [CO2], assimilation rates
decreased at temperatures above about 25 ◦C (Figure
1B). In this data, the leaf to air water vapor pressure
difference increased exponentially with temperature

from about 0.8 kPa at 18 ◦C to about 4.0 kPa at 38
◦C. It was noticed that assimilation rates were lower
at a given temperature for leaves measured after day
280 (Figure 1B), when photosynthetic acclimation to
growth at elevated [CO2] was not evident (see later).
When comparing the photosynthetic CO2 assim-
ilation rates of plants grown at elevated [CO2] with
those of plants grown without supplemental [CO2] but
measured at elevated [CO2], analysis of variance in-
dicated that signiﬁcant (P < 0.001) effects of growth
[CO2], measurement date, and a signiﬁcant interaction
between growth [CO2] and measurement date. This
interaction is illustrated for the 1998 data in Figure
2, for the plants grown at + 600 µmol mol−1. Evid-
ence of acclimation (i.e. an assimilation ratio less than
1 in Figure 2) was not related to the temperature or
the assimilation rate of the plants grown at the current

ambient [CO2] in any obvious way (Figure 2). It was
found that the data for all years could be subdivided
into three sets in which the growth [CO2] by meas-
urement date interaction terms were non-signiﬁcant at
P = 0.05. The three subsets were: all data after day
of year 280, all data when leaf water potentials were
below −1.9 MPa in plants grown at ambient [CO2],
and all other data. Acclimation of photosynthesis to
growth at elevated [CO2] was signiﬁcant in the main
data set, but not in the two restricted sets of dry
conditions and during the fall (Table 1). There were
no dates when photosynthetic acclimation to elevated
[CO2] was large enough to eliminate the stimulation
of photosynthesis at the growth [CO2]. Averaged over
all dates, midday photosynthetic rates measured at the
daytime growth [CO2] were 14.7, 26.0 and 30.3 µmol
m−2 s−1 for the ambient, ambient + 300, and ambient
+ 600 µmol mol−1 [CO2] treatments, respectively.
Acclimation of photosynthesis to growth at elev-
ated [CO2] was evident even when measurements days
followed several cloudy days. For example, in Figure
2, day of year 134 was preceded by 10 days with
daily integrals of photosynthetically active radiation
of less than 9 mol m−2 d−1 (compared with a clear
day total of about 45 mol m−2 d−1 at this time of
year). There were three additional measurement days
which followed several days of cloudy weather, yet
still indicated photosynthetic acclimation to elevated
[CO2].
Stomatal conductance of plants grown at the cur-
rent ambient [CO2] was unresponsive to measurement
[CO2] except when plants had low leaf water poten-
tials (Table 2). Substomatal [CO2] was affected by
growth [CO2] only under dry conditions (Table 2).
The usually constant Ci across growth [CO2] treat-
ments reﬂected proportional changes in conductance
and photosynthesis.
For each of four dates tested, photosynthetic rates
of plants grown at the highest [CO2] were not satur-
ated for CO2 at the Ci occurring under the growth
conditions. Averaged over four measurement dates
photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rates of plants grown
at + 600 µmol mol−1 [CO2] were 35.1 and 41.8
µmol m−2 s−1 when measured at 950 and 1200 µmol
mol−1[CO2], respectively, compared with a rate of
42 µmol mol−1 at 950 µmol mol−1 [CO2] for plant
grown without supplemental [CO2].
Midday leaf water potentials on the ‘dry’ measure-
ment dates averaged −2.2, −2.2, and −2.3 MPa for
plants at the current ambient [CO2], ambient + 300
and ambient + 600, respectively. Soil water potentials
at a depth of 25 cm averaged −1.13, −0.83, and −0.64
for the ambient, + 300 and + 600 [CO2] treatments,
respectively, on these dates. Midday leaf water poten-
tials averaged over all other measurement dates were
−1.6 MPa for all [CO2] treatments.
Leaf nitrogen per unit of area was measured on
four dates in the spring and early summer, when pho-
tosynthetic acclimation was evident. The plants grown
at the two elevated [CO2]s had mean values which
were about 9% lower than plants grown at the current
ambient [CO2], i.e. 2.0 g m−2 compared with 2.2 g
m−2, but these differences were not statistically sig-
niﬁcant at P = 0.05. Gas exchange measurements on
these same dates indicated 15 and 26% lower photo-
synthetic CO2 assimilation rates for plants grown at +
300 and + 600 µmol mol−1 [CO2], respectively, com-
pared with plants grown at the current ambient [CO2],
when measurements were made at + 300 and + 600
µmol mol−1.
Leaf starch content was measured on three dates
in the spring, when photosynthetic acclimation to el-
evated [CO2] was evident, and one date in the fall,
when no acclimation occurred. Similar leaf starch val-
ues occurred on all dates for the ambient and ambient
+ 300 treatments, while for the ambient + 600 [CO2]
treatment, higher starch values occurred in the spring
than in the fall (Figure 3).
When the lowest and highest [CO2] treatments
were switched, at the end of the experiment, CO2
assimilation rates responded to the switch within one
day, and by day three, were completely reversed (Table
3). The same patterns were obtained for photosyn-

Discussion
Leaf gas exchange measurements in this study began
in the spring as soon as new leaves ﬁnished area ex-
pansion (about day 100), and ended in the fall when
severe freezes killed most leaves (about day 310).
Very few green leaves persisted during the winter. The
gas exchange measurement periods were estimated to
cover more than 90% of the yearly leaf area duration,
and thus should be reasonably representative of this
cultivar in this climate.
The short-term response of strawberry leaf photo-
synthesis to elevated [CO2] did not have the insensitiv-
ity to seasonal temperature changes observed in some
other cool climate species (Teskey 1997; Bunce 1998,
2000), but had a larger stimulation at all temperatures
than predicted from Rubisco kinetic characteristics.
The simplest explanation for a larger stimulation than
expected, a signiﬁcant internal diffusive resistance,
could account for this discrepancy at warm temperat-
ures, but probably not at low temperatures. We used
assumed internal resistances such that Cc = 0.7∗Ci
for measurements at Ca = 350 µmol mol−1 [CO2],
but these resistances were not large enough to ex-
plain the observed stimulation of photosynthesis by
elevated [CO2] at cool temperatures. Such resistances
are on the high end of estimates of internal resistance
for other species (Laisk and Loreto 1996; Gillon and
Yakir 2000). Our simulations indicate that the stimu-
lation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2] is not very
sensitive to internal resistance at cool temperatures.
In some of the other studies where the stimulation
of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2] was larger than
predicted by Rubisco kinetics at cool temperatures,
measurements indicated an unexpectedly high CO2
compensation point, which suggested a low apparent

speciﬁcity of Rubisco (Bunce 1998, 2000). This aspect
was not investigated in the present study. Our data
indicate that, in the absence of photosynthetic accli-
mation to growth at elevated [CO2], strawberry leaf
photosynthesis would be strongly stimulated by rising
atmospheric [CO2] even at cool times of the year.
However, acclimation of photosynthesis to elev-
ated [CO2] was evident on about two thirds of the
measurement days. The days when no acclimation
occurred ﬁt into two classes, occasions when plants
grown at the current ambient [CO2] were under wa-
ter stress, and in the fall, after day 280. Other studies
have also shown that acclimation of photosynthesis to
elevated [CO2] occurring under well watered condi-
tions may not be evident during water stress (Huxman
et al. 1998; Sicher and Bunce 1999). This probably
occurred because plants grown at lower [CO2] had
higher stomatal conductance and depleted soil wa-
ter faster than plants grown at elevated [CO2], as
documented here for strawberries. The water deﬁcit
inhibited photosynthesis more for plants grown at the
lower [CO2], and resulted in no photosynthetic differ-
ences between plants grown at ambient and elevated
[CO2]. The lack of evidence of photosynthetic ac-
climation to elevated [CO2] in the fall may have a
somewhat similar cause, greater inhibition of photo-
synthesis by environmental stress in plants at the lower
[CO2]. This is suggested by the lower rates of photo-
synthesis of plants grown at the current ambient [CO2]
at a given measurement temperature in the fall than at
other times of year. There are reports for other species
of elevated [CO2] protecting against damage to pho-
tosynthesis caused by low temperatures (Sionit et al.
1981; Potvin and Strain 1985; Boese et al. 1997), but
these studies have been for chilling sensitive species.
In this study, the period in the fall when photosyn-
thetic acclimation did not occur was after frosts had
occurred.
The cause of the acclimation of photosynthesis to
growth at elevated [CO2] which occurred on the ma-
jority of measurement dates was not clear. The data
presented make it unlikely that any of three commonly
proposed causes were operating, triose phosphate util-
ization limitation at elevated [CO2], low leaf nitrogen
244
content and high source–sink ratio. Two observa-
tions ruled out triosphosphate utilization rate limita-
tion. First, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rates of
plants grown at the highest [CO2] were not satur-
ated for CO2 at the concentration used to assay for
photosynthetic acclimation. Secondly, the switching
experiment showed that acclimation was evident when
photosynthesis was measured at the current ambient
[CO2], which was severely limiting for all plants. Leaf
nitrogen content per unit of leaf area was only slightly
and not statistically signiﬁcantly lower in plants grown
at elevated [CO2]. The rapid reversibility of photosyn-
thetic acclimation also argues against changes in major
leaf nitrogen-containing constituents controlling pho-
tosynthetic acclimation. For example, in rice, transfer
to lower [CO2] resulted in an increase in the transcipts
for the small subunit of Rubisco within one day, but no
change in Rubisco activity or soluble protein was de-
tectable after three days (Gesch et al. 2000), although
changes were detected at ten days. High source–sink
ratio at elevated [CO2] as a cause of the photosynthetic
acclimation is also unlikely, since acclimation did not
decrease during fruiting, nor during long periods of
cloudy weather, and leaf starch content remained high
in the fall when no acclimation occurred.
Acclimation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation
was accompanied by a parallel acclimation of stomatal
conductance such that substomatal [CO2] was not af-
fected by the growth [CO2] except when water stress
occurred and photosynthetic acclimation was not evid-
ent. Proportional acclimation of assimilation rate and
stomatal conductance to growth at elevated [CO2] has
been reported for other species (e.g. Bunce 2001).
Constant Ci rules out an increase in stomatal limitation
of photosynthesis as a cause of photosynthetic accli-
mation, unless patchy stomatal conductance occurred
(Buckely et al. 1997). Patchy stomatal conductance
has not been reported in studies of acclimation to el-
evated [CO2]. The observation that stomatal conduct-
ance was insensitive to measurement [CO2] except
during water stress is consistent with other evidence
that water stress or high abscisic acid content may
increase stomatal sensitivity to [CO2] (Bunce 1998b;
Leymarie et al. 1999).
Measurements of Rubisco activity and activation
status might have been useful in identifying the causes
of acclimation, and were attempted. However, the
assays were unsuccessful in this tissue, presumably
because of large amounts of inhibitory compounds
which could not be overcome using the usual methods.
Whatever the cause of photosynthetic acclimation in
the present study, consideration of seasonal changes
in plant source–sink balance did not help to predict its
occurrence.
While acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated
[CO2] was frequently evident in these nutrient-limited,
ﬁeld-grown strawberries, the degree of acclimation
was never enough to eliminate the substantial stimu-
lation of photosynthesis by growth at elevated [CO2].
The more severe photosynthetic acclimation to elev-
ated [CO2] observed by Keutgen et al. (1997) in sand
culture in a glasshouse was accompanied by greatly
reduced leaf nitrogen contents, which did not occur in
the present study. It is unclear whether such extreme
nutrient deﬁciencies are likely under normal cultural
conditions in the ﬁeld, or whether higher fertility than
used in the present study could eliminate acclimation
of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2].
