BEANS 
 
    Dry Edible Bean market activity has picked up in 
recent weeks with the most active being noted on Pinto 
and Black beans with the increased demand from 
Mexico.  However, this week trading became slow at 
current price levels, as some participants were waiting 
on the Government purchases to be announced later this 
week on the 2630 MT of pinto beans. There is concern 
in the Great Northern market due very light demand for 
heavy supply. Uncertainty, among buyers and sellers 
has been caused the unsettled market conditions.   
However, as more classes are starting be posted at the 
grower levels, markets began to establish.   All prices 
quoted are quoted on very limited trading. 
 
             PINTOS were generally steady, a firm 
undertone in ND on the dealer level; grower levels 
steady. 
 
 
GREAT NORTHERNS were not established at 
either the dealer or grower level in all regions due to no 
demand for heavy offerings.  
 
              SMALL WHITES were not established at either 
the dealer or grower level. 
 
 LIGHT RED KIDNEYS dealer levels steady in 
very limited trading; not established at grower levels. 
 
 DARK RED KIDNEYS were not established at 
either the dealer or grower level. 
 
PINKS WA/ID dealer and grower level steady; 
ND/MN not established at either dealer or grower levels. 
 
             SMALL REDS dealer levels steady; MI grower 
levels steady, 38.00 to 39.00 in ID and 42.00 to 43.00 in 
WA. 
 
             BLACK BEANS were steady at both the dealer 
and grower levels. 
 
CRANBERRY BEANS were not established at 
either the dealer or grower level. 
 
PEA BEANS were steady in MI, no recent test in 
ND on either dealer; grower levels steady. 
 
GARBANZOS were mostly steady, with the 
range narrowing on the deal levels; grower levels steady.

PEAS AND LENTILS MARKET SUMMARY 
 
DEALER MARKET:  Trading activity was light to moderate.  ID Peas and Lentil prices were steady to firm; ND 
Green peas had no recent test to compare.  Business was slowed due to the most recent government invitation which 
awards will be announced later this week.  The invitation accounts for about 18, 020 MT of peas and lentils. Yellow 
splits, wholes and Green whole peas make up the majority of the tonnage.

GROWER MARKET:     Market activity moderate.  Green and Yellow Peas levels are steady.  Pardina and Brewer 
lentils were steady.  ND grower prices started coming back on the board this week as growers were looking at the 
recent government invention that is due tomorrow.  Up to this point the only movement being noted out of ND was 
shipments to fill Government contracts that were issued late last year.Â

GROWER MARKET:  Trading activity was slow.   Demand light to moderate.  All classes were steady on limited 
grower selling.  The lack of moisture either in the form of rain or snow has many growers concerned and causing 
them to be hesitant to commit.
