Summary 
The Hanford Site has 149 underground single-shell tanks that store hazardous radioactive waste.  Many of 
these tanks and their associated infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, diversion boxes) have leaked.  Some of the 
leaked waste has entered the groundwater.  The largest known leak occurred from the T-106 Tank in 1973.  
Many of the contaminants from that leak still reside within the vadose zone beneath the T Tank Farm.  
CH2M Hill Hanford Group, Inc. seeks to minimize movement of this residual contaminant plume by 
placing an interim barrier on the surface.  Such a barrier is expected to prevent infiltrating water from 
reaching the plume and moving it further.  A plan has been prepared to monitor and determine the 
effectiveness of the interim surface barrier.  Soil-water content (θ) and water pressure (ψ) will be 
monitored using off-the-shelf equipment that can be installed by the hydraulic hammer technique.  Two 
instrument nests were installed in fiscal year (FY) 2006.  Each instrument nest contains a neutron probe 
access tube, a capacitance probe (to measure θ), four heat-dissipation units (to measure ψ), and a drain 
gauge to measure soil-water flux.  A meteorological station has been installed outside of the fence.  Two 
additional instrument nests are planned to be installed beneath the proposed barrier in FY 2007.

1.0 Introduction 
The Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State has 149 underground single-shell tanks (SSTs) that 
store hazardous radioactive waste.  Many of these tanks and their associated infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, 
diversion boxes) have leaked.  Some of the leaked waste has entered the groundwater.  The largest known 
leak occurred from the T-106 Tank in 1973.  Many of the contaminants from that leak still reside within 
the vadose zone beneath the T Tank Farm.  CH2M Hill Hanford Group, Inc. (CHG) seeks to minimize 
movement of this residual contaminant plume by placing an interim barrier on the surface.  This 
monitoring plan is prepared to guide the monitoring program and will replace a previous prepared design 
plan. 
1.1 T Tank Farm and Tank T-106 Leak 
According to Myers (2005), the T tank farm was built from 1943 to 1944.  The T tank farm contains 
12  SSTs with a diameter of 23 m (75 ft) and a capacity of 2,006,050 L (530,000 gal), four SSTs with a 
diameter of 6.1 m (20 ft) and a capacity of 208,175 L (55,000 gal), waste-transfer lines, leak-detection 
systems, and tank ancillary equipment.  The soil cover from the apex of the tank domes to ground surface 
is approximately 2.2 m (7.3 ft).  All the tanks have a dish-shaped bottom.  Figure 1.1 shows the waste 
management area (WMA) of the T tank farm and surrounding facilities. 
 
In general, the vadose zone in the T tank farm consists of a portion of the thick, relatively coarse-grained 
sediments of the middle Ringold Formation (Rwi) overlain by the finer grained sediments of the upper 
Ringold Formation (Rtf) and the Plio-Pleistocene unit (also called the Cold Creek Unit, CCU), overlain by 
the coarser grained sands and gravels of the Hanford formation (H), which are exposed at the surface.  
The upper 12 m (40 ft) of the Hanford formation was locally excavated and backfilled with gravelly sand 
during installation of the SSTs. 
 
According to Hanford’s Waste Information Data System (WIDS), an accidental leak from Tank T-106 
occurred in 1973, and the details and chronology of the leak are well documented (ARHCO 1973; 
Routson et al. 1979).  The leak was suspected to have started on April 20, 1973, during a routine filling 
operation.  The leak stopped on June 10, 1973, when the free liquid contents of the tank were removed.  
The total duration of the leak was estimated to be 51 days.  Approximately 435,000 L (115,000 gal) of 
fluid leaked from Tank T-106.  The fluid contained cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium, and various 
fission products, including technetium-99.  It is likely that the leak occurred in the southeast quadrant of 
the tank near the bottom of the tank side. 
 
CHG has proposed to use an interim surface barrier over Tank T-106 and the surrounding area in the 
T-tank farm to prevent or reduce infiltration of meteoric water entering into the subsurface to reduce the 
rate of the downward movement of leaked contaminants.  
1.2 Surface Barrier and Monitoring 
CH2M HILL Hanford Group has proposed to use felt with a polyurea coating as an interim barrier over 
the part of the T Tank Farm in Hanford.  It is expected that the interim barrier will prevent the meteoric 
water from entering into soil and consequently will reduce the rate of downward movement of flow and 
dissolving contaminants.  At shallower depths, there will be no water supply from above to replace the 
 
 
1.2
draining water, and hence, it will dry up more quickly.  At larger depths, soil will keep receiving drainage 
from the soil above for some time and will drain relatively more slowly.  Therefore, it may take a very 
long time (e.g., years) for drainage rates deep in the profile (e.g., > 10 m) to reduce significantly.  As the 
soil below the surface barrier becomes drier, the soil in the uncovered region near the vertical plane 
directly beneath the barrier edge will also be drier than would be the case if there would be no surface 
barrier. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.1. Waste Management Area of the T Tank Farm and Surrounding Facilities (from Myers 2005) 
 
In fiscal year (FY) 2006, two instrument nests were installed by the hydraulic hammer technique outside 
of the proposed surface barrier.  Soil-water content (θ), water pressure (ψ), and temperature (T) are 
monitored using neutron probes, capacitance probes, and heat-dissipation units (HDUs).  In FY 2007, two 
additional instrument nests, both inside the proposed surface barrier, will be installed.  Each instrument 
nest will contain a neutron access tube and a capacitance probe (to measure θ), and four HDUs (to 
measure ψ and T).   
1.3 Objectives and Scope  
Subsurface monitoring is integral to achieving acceptance of covers.  The subsurface water conditions 
will be monitored to verify impacts of the T-106 interim barrier on the soil-moisture regime.  
 
 
 
1.3
This monitoring plan updates the previous design plan and provides additional technical details for 
monitoring the soil-water regime and evaluating the impacts of the interim surface barrier on sub-surface 
moisture conditions.  After a brief introduction of the background information in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 
summarizes the numerical simulation results, which were used as guidance for designing the monitoring 
system.  Chapter 3 presents the principles of relevant measurement methods as guidance for equipment 
calibration.  In Chapter 4, equipment calibration or verification procedures and results are presented.  
Chapter 5 summarizes the installation of the two existing instrument nests and the plan for installing two 
additional nests.  Chapter 6 presents the schedule of data collection, data validation and analysis, 
contingencies given instrument failure, and data reporting.  Chapter 7 provides a declaration about the 
quality assurance plan to verify the quality of the work.

2.0 Numerical Analysis 
This section presents numerical simulation results of water flow after placing an interim surface barrier 
over a portion of the T tank farm.  The Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases (STOMP) numerical 
simulator (White and Oostrom 2004) was used to predict the movement of vadose-zone water in response 
to placement of an interim surface barrier on July 1, 2007. 
 
The interim surface barrier is expected to be an impermeable layer and will be sloped so that excess water 
is drained outside the T Farm.  For this analysis, it is assumed that all excess water is successfully 
removed such that none infiltrates at the barrier edge. 
 
The simulation was conducted for 50 years after placing the interim surface barrier.  Water contents, 
pressure heads, and fluxes at specific locations were compared and contrasted to highlight changes caused 
by barrier placement.  The results were used to guide sensor selection and placement (explained more 
fully in Section 3.0).  Some gas-phase and temperature effects may be caused by the interim surface 
barrier, but these processes were considered secondary to the water-flow solution and were not simulated 
in this exercise.  The following sections describe the geology and hydraulic properties, domain, initial and 
boundary conditions, and the simulation results. 
2.1 Geology and Hydraulic Properties 
The borehole C4104 drilled near T-106 showed the geology as six main layers whose depths and soil 
types are given in Table 2.1 (Serne et al. 2004).  The hydraulic parameters for each of the geological 
formations were from Khaleel et al. (2004) and are listed in Table 2.2. 
2.2 Simulation Domain, Initial and Boundary Conditions 
The three-dimensional physical domain was discretized with 74 nodes in both the east-west (x) and north-
south (y) directions and 55 nodes in the vertical (z) direction.  Horizontal node spacing was uniformly 
2 m; vertical spacing was uniformly 1 m.  The total domain size was 148 m in the x and y directions and 
55 m in the z direction.  The origin of the simulation domain in the Hanford coordinate system was 
(x0, y0) = (566710, 136650) m.  The domain includes the 12 large tanks (T-101 through T-112) but not 
other infrastructures (e.g., the 200 series tanks and trenches).  The nodes representing each tank were 
treated as inactive and did not interact with the changing water conditions in the vadose zone.

The initial conditions within the simulation domain at an estimated time in which the interim surface 
barrier was to be placed (July 1, 2007) were established using a two-step simulation.  First, the uniform 
recharge rate was 3.5 mm/yr (Khaleel et al. 2004) before 1945, the year the tanks were deployed.  Then, 
the simulation ran from 1945 to July 1, 2007, the time the interim surface barrier was to be installed, 
under the recharge rate of 100 mm/yr (Khaleel et al. 2004).  Normally, such hydraulic conditions would 
be the same as at similar depths across the domain, but, because of the shedding effect caused by the 
impermeable tanks, water flowing around the tanks (i.e., represented by inactive nodes) created slightly 
different initial conditions in the vicinity of the tanks. 
 
At time zero (i.e., July 1, 2007), the interim barrier was placed on the surface above Tanks T-105, -106, -
108, and -109 as shown in Figure 2.1.  The surface barrier was rectangular-shaped, and its size was 76×66 
m [from (x1, y1) = (36, 36) m to (x2, y2) = (112, 102) m] with the longer sides orienting to the east-west 
direction.  The surface barrier was simulated by changing the boundary condition inside the surface 
barrier to zero flux and keeping the boundary condition at 100 mm/yr outside the surface barrier.  A water 
table was applied to the bottom boundary to mimic the water table beneath the T tank farm. 
 
The effects of the interim surface barrier on soil-water conditions were shown by comparing soil-water 
variables at two locations, one inside the surface barrier [(x, y) = (81, 67) m] and the other outside the 
surface barrier [(x, y) = (15, 67) m].  As will be shown below, these effects are stronger at a shallower 
depth and weaker at a deeper depth. 
2.3 Simulation Results 
The time series and/or the spatial distribution of the simulated results of soil-water content, saturation, 
pressure head, and water flux are reported below.

Figure 2.1. Simulation Domain Without and with an Interim Surface Barrier.  The domain size was 
(x, y, z) = (148, 148, 55) m.  The origin of the simulation domain in the Hanford coordinate 
system was (x0, y0) = (466710, 136650) m. 
 
2.3.1 Time Series of Soil-Water Content 
Figure 2.2 shows the time series of soil-water content inside [(x, y) = (81, 67) m] and outside [(x, y) = (15, 
67) m] the surface barrier at four different depths.  As expected, the soil-water content was stable through 
the simulation period outside the surface barrier.  Inside the surface barrier, the soil-water content 
decreased with time.  The water-content decrease ranged from 0.0 at the 25.5-m depth to 0.015 m3m-3 at 
the 0.5-m depth 1 year after the placement of the surface barrier; 3 years after the placement of the surface 
barrier, the water-content decrease ranged from 0.005 m3m-3 at the 25.5-m depth to 0.025 m3m-3 at 15.5-m 
depth.  Note that the slight difference in water content at the time the surface barrier was placed 
(Year 2007.5) was caused by the shedding effects of the impermeable tanks at depths of 15.5 and 25.5 m. 
2.3.2 Time Series of Soil-Water Pressure Head 
Figure 2.3 shows the time series of the soil pressure head inside [(x, y) = (81, 67) m] and outside 
[(x, y) = (15, 67) m] the interim surface barrier at four different depths.  As expected, the soil-water 
pressure was stable through the simulation period outside the surface barrier.  Inside the surface barrier, 
the soil-water pressure decreased (became more negative) with time.  One year after the placement of the 
surface barrier, the soil-water pressure decrease ranged from 0.0 bar (0.0 m) at 25.5-m depth to -0.244 bar 
(-2.49 m) at 0.5-m depth; 3 years after the placement of the surface barrier, the soil-water pressure 
decrease ranged from -0.018 bar (-0.19 m) at 25.5-m depth to -0.407 bar (-4.15 m) at 0.5-m depth.  Note 
that the slight difference in soil-water pressure at the time the surface barrier was placed (Year 2007.5) 
was caused by the shedding effects of the impermeable tanks at depths of 15.5 and 25.5 m.

barrier was stable through the simulation period.  Inside the surface barrier, the soil-water flux decreased 
with time.  One year after the placement of the surface barrier, the soil-water flux decrease ranged from 
0.2 mm/yr at 25.5-m depth to 94.7 mm/yr at 0.5-m depth; 3 years after the placement of the surface 
barrier, the soil-water flux decrease ranged from 27.2 mm/yr at 25.5-m depth to 98.3 mm/yr at 0.5-m 
depth.  Note that, at depths of 15.5 and 25.5 m, the slight difference in soil-water flux at the time the 
surface barrier was placed (Year 2007.5) was caused by the shedding effects of the impermeable tanks.

2.3.4 Spatial Distribution of Soil-Water Saturation 
The spatial distributions of soil water are shown using two-dimensional contours of soil-water saturation 
in the selected horizontal planes and vertical planes at the time the surface barrier was applied (Year 
2007.5) and 1, 2, and 3 years after the surface barrier was applied.  
 
Figure 2.5 shows the horizontal distribution of soil-water saturation at a depth of 0.5 m in different times.  
At the time the surface barrier was placed (Year 2007.5), the soil water was uniform, except that it was 
slightly wetter at the places right above each of the tanks because of the tank shedding effect.  After the 
surface barrier was emplaced, the soil beneath the surface barrier became drier gradually.  Similar effects 
can be seen at the depth of 15.5 m (Figure 2.6).

Figure 2.7 shows the vertical distributions of soil-water saturation and stream lines at an easting transect 
crossing the center of Tanks T-104, T-105, and T-106.  The soil beneath the surface barrier became drier 
gradually.  The stream lines indicate that, as the soil beneath the surface barrier became drier, some water 
at the relatively wetter region beneath the place without a surface barrier moved laterally into the drier 
region beneath the covered region.  This effect became stronger with time.  This lateral movement of 
water is referred as the “edging effect.”  The results suggest that, 3 years after the placement of the 
surface barrier, the distance being affected beyond the edge of the surface barrier in the easting direction 
was about 5 m.  Figure 2.8 shows vertical distributions of soil-water saturation and stream lines at an 
easting transect crossing the center between tank rows T-104, T-105, T-106 and tank rows T-107, T-108,

3.0 Monitoring Methods and Equipment 
This section describes the criteria used to select the various measurement methods, the principals of 
selected methods, and the description of the selected instruments.  
3.1 Soil Water and Environmental Variables 
Variables to be monitored are chosen based on their contribution to describing soil-water flux conditions 
and inputs.  Principal variables to be monitored are 1) soil-moisture content, 2) soil-water pressure, and 
3) soil-water flux.  Soil-water content shows the actual moisture contained in the soil.  Soil-water content 
ranges between zero and the porosity of the soil.  Soil-water pressure (or head) describes the energy level 
of soil water and is of primary importance in determining the state and movement of water in the soil.  
Differences in the soil-water head between one point and another give rise to the tendency of water to 
flow within the soil.  Soil-water pressure in the vadose zone is often negative due to the suction of soil 
particles on water.  Unless the soil is very dry, the pressure head generally varies logarithmically from 
zero when the soil is fully saturated to a few bars (negative pressure) when soil drainage has effectively 
ended.  Both soil-water content and pressure describe the static state of soil water.  Soil-water flux 
describes the dynamic state of soil water, showing how fast soil water moves in the soil.  The reasons for 
monitoring all three types of variables are summarized below. 
• 
Each variable reflects one aspect of the soil-moisture regime.  
• 
Their variation is different under different conditions.  On the one hand, the change of water 
content can be measured more easily than the change of pressure head under relatively wet 
conditions.  On the other hand, the change of pressure head can be measured more easily than the 
change of water content under relatively dry conditions.  
• 
Soil-water flux is directly related to the transport velocity of the dissolving solute.  However, due 
to very small values, especially in arid regions (e.g., on the order of a few to a few tens of mm/yr 
at Hanford), the measurement is often difficult.  With the emergence of a new measuring 
technique, water flux as low as 1 mm/yr is measurable in coarse textured soils.  
 
Secondary variables to be monitored include soil temperature and meteorological conditions, including 
precipitation and air temperature.  The measured precipitation will be used to estimate the total volume of 
water intercepted by the surface barrier. 
3.2 Criteria for Method Selection 
Table 3.1 illustrates criteria for selecting monitoring methods that were modified from criteria described 
by Everett et al. (1984).  The criteria provide for a systematic way of determining which monitoring 
technologies will best serve the given objectives.  Because of restrictions of working within the T tank 
farm, considerable attention was given to potential installation problems and constraints when selecting 
methods.  For example, the segmented time-domain reflectometry probe was considered to measure water 
content.  Due to the significant impacts of temperature on probe response and to impacts of cable length 
on signal strength, this probe was eliminated.  The cone-penetrometer was also considered to measure 
soil-water pressure head, but this method was also eliminated because of its possible insufficient strength 
in gravelly soil.  While the selected technologies may not meet all criteria, they do encompass the 
majority of criteria presented.

3.3
Based on the criteria in Table 3.1, equipment such as a neutron probe, capacitance sensors, HDUs, and 
water flux meters are being used to monitor flow regime.  A rain gauge is also installed to more 
accurately record precipitation, especially for storms.  All the equipment except the neutron probe will be 
connected to data loggers, which remotely transmit data to a computer.  The following sections describe 
the principle of each method and specific equipment chosen. 
3.3 Water Content 
Moisture content as a function of depth will be measured to monitor the impacts of the interim surface 
barrier in reducing water flux from baseline conditions.  Soil-water measurements will be used to track 
wetting and drying processes and produce estimates of water fluxes using available soil-water potential 
data and soil hydraulic properties.  Two methods, neutron moisture probe and capacitance probe, will be 
employed to monitor absolute or relative soil-moisture content.  This affords the benefit of providing 
certain data through redundancy while at the same time offering advantages presented by each method.  
Additionally, both methods of measurement provide the accuracy (Table 3.1) needed to capture the 
predicted changes in soil-moisture content after the interim surface barrier is in place.   
3.3.1 Neutron Probe Method 
3.3.1.1 Principles 
Neutron thermalization, as a method to measure soil-water content, uses a radioactive source of fast 
neutrons (mean energy of 5 MeV) and a detector of slow neutrons (~0.025 eV).  High-energy neutrons 
emitted from the source are either slowed through repeated collisions with the nuclei of atoms in the soil 
(scattering) or are absorbed by those nuclei.  The most common atoms in soil (Al, Si, and O) scatter 
neutrons with little energy loss.  If the neutron hits an H atom, its energy is reduced on average to about 
half because the mass of the H nucleus is the same as that of the neutron.  The concentration of thermal 
neutrons changes mainly with the H content of the surrounding material, while changes in H content 
occur mainly because of changes in soil-water content.  Therefore, the concentration of thermal neutrons 
surrounding a neutron source placed in the soil can be precisely related to the soil volumetric water 
content. 
 
A profiling type neutron moisture meter has a readout and control unit connected by cable to a cylindrical 
probe that is lowered into a borehole that is usually cased with an access tube.  The probe is lowered into 
the tube and stopped at intervals to measure the thermal neutron concentration at that depth.  The 
measurement volume is approximately a sphere with a radius of about 0.15 m in a wet clay soil and up to 
0.5 m if the water content declines to 0.02 m3m-3 (van Bavel et al. 1956). 
3.3.1.2 Neutron Probe  
Any type of neutron probe that has been calibrated can be used to measure soil-water content.  An 
example is the 503DR hydroprobe (Figure 3.1) manufactured by CPN International, Inc. (Martinez, CA).  
The 503DR hydroprobe has a history of successful use at Hanford and is currently used for a number of 
Hanford waste site soil-moisture monitoring programs (DOE 2005; Ward et al. 2000).  The probe 
includes a 50-mCi americium-241 and beryllium source and a neutron detector.  The 16-sec neutron 
counts are recorded at different depths of 1-ft intervals.  Operation of the Hydroprobe should follow the 
“Tank Farm Plant Operating Procedure—Operate Model 503DR Hydroprobe Neutron Moisture 
Detection” (Ross 2007). 
 
 
3.4
3.3.2 Capacitance Method 
Capacitance, as an electromagnetic method to 
measure soil-water content, was introduced in 
the 1930s (Smith-Rose 1933) and developed 
rapidly with recent advances of microelectroncs 
in the 1990s (Paltineau and Starr 1997).  
According to Starr and Paltineanu (2002), 
positive features of capacitance probes include 
robust and stable instrumentation, fast response 
times, accuracy with good soil-probe contact, 
ease of use, safety, availability of several sensor 
configurations, and amenability to automatic 
and continuous logging over large areas (up to 
500-m radium).  
3.3.2.1 Principles 
To measure the volumetric soil-water content 
(θv), the capacitance method uses the soil 
surrounding the electrodes as part of a capacitor 
in which the dipoles of water in the soil become 
polarized in response to the frequency of an 
imposed electric field.  Capacitance probes 
consist of a capacitor connected to circuitry that 
oscillates at a frequency (F) that is dependent 
on the inductance (L) of an inductor and the 
total capacitance (C) of the electrode-soil system.  For a given probe, the value of L is constant, and the 
value of C is related to the bulk dielectric constant (εra) of the surrounding soil: 
 
C = gεra 
(3.1)
 
where g is a geometrical constant based on the electrode configuration (size, shape, and distance between 
electrodes).  The output of the capacitance probe is the oscillation frequency, which is an inverse square 
root function of the total capacitance:

(3.2)
 
The total capacitance of the soil is a function of volumetric soil-water content (θv).  Hence, oscillation 
frequency is a function of soil-water content.  
 
The probe geometric constant, g, is often instrument-dependent.  For one calibration equation to cover all 
the sensors and to allow one sensor or probe to be replaced at the same field position without loss of data 
continuity, a normalization process is used to minimize instrumental-dependent readings.  For cylindrical 
sensors, a scaled frequency (Sf) is calculated by incorporating the raw-frequency reading in soil (F) with 
frequency readings in air (Fa) and in water (Fw) (Paltineanu and Starr 1997):

The zone of influence has both axial 
(vertically along the sensor) and radial 
(perpendicular to the sensor) components.  
The extent and shape of the primary zone of 
influence is largely dependent on the sensor 
geometry.  Paltineanu and Starr (1997) 
found the axial zone of influence to be 
±5 cm, centered at the plastic ring between 
the two metal rings, and the radial zone of 
influence to be primarily within 10 cm of 
the access pipe.  Both axial and radial 
sensitivities were affected by soil-water 
content and scaled frequency.  This suggests 
the importance of good probe installation.

3.4 Soil Matric Potential and Heat Dissipation Unit Method 
Soil-water-pressure measurements can be used to track wetting or drying processes, identify pressure 
gradients, and produce estimates of water fluxes using available soil-water-content data and soil hydraulic 
properties.   
 
An HDU can be used to indirectly measure the soil matric potential (ψs) by measuring the thermal 
conductivity (k) of the reference matrix, which is part of an HDU and often is made of porous ceramics.  
The water content of the ceramic matrix (θvc) changes with the matric potential of the ceramic matrix (ψc) 
and causes a corresponding change in k.  Because the equilibrium between the sensor and the soil is a 
matric potential (i.e., ψs = ψc) rather than a water-content equilibrium, the measured thermal conductivity 
of the reference matrix is related to the matric potential of the soil.  HDU measurement and calibration are 
independent of soil texture because the heat pulse is restricted to the ceramic.  It is also independent of 
salinity because the method is independent of electrical conductivity.  
3.4.1 Principles 
HDUs consist of a heater and a temperature sensor in a porous matrix material.  The HDU is heated for a 
fixed time period.  The rate of heat dissipation is controlled by the water content of the porous matrix 
because water conducts heat much more readily than air.  The temperature increase measured by the 
temperature sensor at time t represents the heat that is not dissipated at this time.  The time dependence of 
temperature, T, in a line heat source buried in an infinite medium can be approximated by Shiozawa and 
Campbell (1990):

where T0 is the initial temperature, q is the heat input, and t0 is an offset time.  Heat dissipation is 
generally determined as the difference between two temperatures, one measured after 1 s of heating and 
the other measured after a heating time that can vary from 20 to 30 s (CSI HDUs).  Whatever time period 
is chosen for laboratory calibration should also be used for field monitoring. 
 
 
 
3.7
Due to the variability of the heat-transfer properties of individual HDUs, the relationship between 
temperature increase and matric potential is sensor-dependent.  Flint et al. (2002) evaluated calibration 
equations for six HDUs and suggested normalizing the temperature increase according to:

where SΔT is the scaled temperature rise, ΔT is the temperature increase, and subscripts “d” and “w” 
denote the temperature increases for a dry and water-saturated ceramic matrix, respectively.  This relation 
results in a range of 0 to 1 for dimensionless temperature.  The matric potential is related to the 
dimensionless temperature rise by an empirical model. 
 
The heat conductivity of the HDUs is temperature dependent, and thus, the measurements that deviate 
from a reference temperature need to be corrected to the reference temperature.  Flint et al. (2002) 
developed the following equations to correct for temperature effects for HDUs calibrated at 20°C:

The upper measurement range of the HDUs is controlled by the air-entry pressure (bubbling pressure) of 
the matrix material of the probe, which is generally -10 kPa (-1 m).  Matric potentials above the air-entry 
pressure (i.e., between 0 and -10 kPa [-1 m]) cannot be measured because the matrix material is 
essentially saturated.  The lower measurement limit is generally considered to be about -1 MPa (-100 m) 
(Reece 1996).  However, less-accurate measurements can be made between -1 and -35 MPa 
(-100 and -3500 m). 
 
It is critical to maintain good hydraulic contact between sensors and surrounding soil in the field.  Good 
contact may be difficult to attain in very coarse sediments, such as gravel.  Wet silica flour is often used 
during installation to confirm that there is good contact between the sensor and surrounding soil.  
Fredlund et al. (2000) found that HDUs do not provide reliable matric-potential measurements in freezing 
or thawing soils because the voltage drops as a result of the effect of the latent heat of fusion on thermal 
conductivity.  However, freeze-thaw cycles did not affect the capability of HDUs to function upon return 
to normal conditions.  
 
 
 
3.8
The heat-dissipation method as currently applied requires constant power dissipation at the heating 
element.  A constant voltage source cannot be used in place of a constant current source because there is a 
voltage drop in the cable.  Thus, if a voltage source were used, different calibrations for sensors with 
different cable lengths would be required.  Variation in applied power during measurement or between 
measurements will cause the temperature increase to change, thus introducing an error in application. 
3.4.2 CSI 229 HDU 
The HDU to be used is made by Campbell Scientific, Inc. and is called the “229 Heat Dissipation Matric 
Water Potential Sensor” (Figure 3.3).  The sensor has a cylindrically-shaped porous ceramic body.  A 
heating element that has the same length as the ceramic body is positioned at the center of the cylinder.  A 
thermocouple is located at mid-length of the ceramic and heating element.  The position of the heating 
element and the thermocouple is maintained by placing both inside a hypodermic needle, which also 
protects the delicate wires.  The volume inside the needle, which is not occupied by wiring, is filled with 
epoxy. 
 
HDUs provide affordable measurements of soil matric potential and also the added benefit of measuring 
soil temperature.  The size of a single HDU is also a benefit, with the CSI HDU (Model 299) dimensions 
being 1.5 cm in diameter and 60 mm in length.

A cutaway view shows the longitudinal section of the needle with heater and thermocouple

3.9
Using the 229 sensor requires a power source that is a constant current source.  This can be achieved by 
using CSI’s CE4 or CE8 current excitation modules, which provide regulated outputs of 50±0.25 mA.  
The –L option on the model 229 sensor indicates that the cable length is user specified.  The 229 sensor is 
compatible with the 21X, CR7, CR10(X), CR23X, CR800, CR1000, and CR3000 dataloggers. 
3.5 Water Flux Meter 
A soil-water balance takes into consideration the inputs, losses, and storage of water in a soil profile.  An 
important component of the water balance is the water that drains from the bottom of the soil profile, 
referred to as drainage.  This is water that has gone sufficiently deep that it cannot be removed from the 
soil by transpiration or evaporation.  This drainage moves downward with dissolved contaminants.  If 
there is no drainage, then there would be no convective movement of contaminants.  The other 
components of the water balance can be measured, but the deep drainage typically has been computed as 
the remainder when the other components were measured and accounted for.  Because of uncertainties in 
the measurements of the other water-balance components, the calculated drainage is subject to large 
errors. 
3.5.1 Principles 
Gee et al. (2002) designed, constructed, and tested a water fluxmeter to directly measure drainage fluxes 
in field soils.  The fluxmeter, which was designed to minimize divergence, concentrates flow into a 
narrow sensing region filled with a fiberglass wick.  The wick applies suction, proportional to its length, 
and passively drains the meter.  The meter can be installed in an augured borehole at almost any depth 
below the root zone.  Water flux through the meter is measured either with a self-calibrating tipping 
bucket, or with a dosing siphon whose action is monitored with a small capacitance probe (see Figure 3.4).  
Under proper conditions, water fluxmeters have the capability of providing continuous and reliable 
monitoring of unsaturated water fluxes ranging from less than 1 mm yr1 to more than 1000 mm yr-1. 
3.5.2 Decagon Drain Gauge 
The drain gauge is installed below the root zone.  Water infiltrates down through the divergence control 
tube and then is pulled by gravity down a fiberglass wick into a collector.  As collected water fills the 
measurement reservoir, the water level is monitored by a water-depth sensor.  When the water level in the 
measurement reservoir reaches the top of the siphon tube, the water empties, and the event is recorded by 
an attached data logger.  The emptied water then drains into the sampling reservoir.  A sampling syringe, 
attached to the water reservoir sampling port (blue tube), can draw water samples out of the sampling 
reservoir for chemical analysis.  Excess water drains out of an overflow port and into the soil while 
allowing a volume of water to remain for sampling. 
 
The drain gauge’s water-level sensor comes with a 3.5-mm “stereo-plug” style connector.  This allows for 
rapid connection directly to a data logger.

3.6 Precipitation and Air and Soil Temperatures 
Precipitation and air temperature will be continuously monitored using a single meteorological station.  
Monitoring precipitation directly at T tank farm is useful in determining the total amount of meteoric 
water and the amount of water intercepted by the surface barrier.  Localized thunderstorms that 
occasionally occur at Hanford produce spatially variable short-term, high-energy precipitation events.  
Such events require that a meteorological monitoring station be located at the T farm to document 
potential localized precipitation events.  Site-specific measurement of precipitation will be used to assess 
the quantity of precipitation intercepted by the barrier. 
 
Power requirements necessary for a heated rain gauge necessitated that the rain gauge not be heated 
because there is no AC power in the Tank Farm.  As such, the rain gauge may not accurately measure 
precipitation during periods of snowfall.  Given the proximity of the Hanford Meteorological Station 
(HMS) and the uniformity of snowfall across the Hanford Site, it is acceptable to conclude that snowfall 
measured by the HMS will approximate describe the snowfall at the T farm.  Table 3.2 gives the 
manufacturer’s documented instrument accuracy along with summarizing the rationale for using the 
chosen monitoring method. 
 
 
 
3.11
The soil temperature will be measured and recorded during set time intervals at various locations.  
Measuring soil temperature provides information on soil-temperature gradients that contribute to liquid 
water and vapor movement in the subsurface.  Automated soil-temperature measurements will be made 
using HDUs, which provide measurements of both soil temperature and soil-water pressure.  HDUs 
provide for an efficient method to measure soil temperature, given that they will already be used for 
measuring soil-water pressure.

3.7 Electric and Electronic Equipment 
The measurement and control device for the HDUs, capacitance probes, drain gauge, and meteorological 
station will be the CR10X or other compatible datalogger manufactured by CSI (Logan, UT).  The 
datalogger allows the data to be measured, processed, stored, and retrieved.  However, permanent power 
does not exist near the proposed placement of the data logger.  This requires that the data logger and 
peripherals be powered by a battery that can be recharged with a solar panel. 
 
For automatic monitoring and data collection, compatible electric and electronic equipment are needed.

4.0 Equipment Calibrations 
All monitoring equipment to be installed at T Tank Farm will be verified to be functioning before field 
installation.  For the temperature sensors, rain gauge, and drain gauges, sensors arrived calibrated to relate 
sensor output to the measurement parameter.  The neutron probe, capacitance probes, and HDUs do not 
come from the manufacturer with the necessary calibration or normalization information, requiring that 
instrument normalization be performed (capacitance probes and HDUs) and calibrations be developed 
(neutron probe and HDUs).  This section documents the instrument verifications and calibrations in 
addition to sensor normalizations.   
4.1 Neutron Probe 
The neutron probe to be used in the monitoring will measure relative soil wetness, which is proportional 
to but not equal to the absolute soil-water content. Additional neutron calibration model may be 
developed to enhance the quantification of soil water content.  The relative soil wetness between different 
locations will still be comparable to show the impact of the surface barrier on soil-water regime.  
4.2 EnviroSMART Capacitance Probe 
Two components exist as part of the EnviroSMART capacitance probe calibration.  First is normalization 
or scaling of the EnviroSMART capacitance sensor output.  Due to slight sensor-to-sensor variations, 
normalization is necessary to allow for direct comparison of results from each capacitance sensor and also 
allows for a single calibration to be used to relate sensor output to volumetric moisture content.  The 
second component is the actual calibration, which is developed using scaled sensor response and 
associated moisture content. 
 
Normalization: Normalization is performed by measuring the response of each sensor in open air and 
when surrounded by water.  The normalization procedure is thoroughly documented in Appendix B of the 
EnviroSMART user’s manual (CSI 2006a).  For that reason, details of the method are not duplicated here.  
The values obtained from the open-air and water measurements are used to normalize sensor output using 
Eq. (3.3). 
 
The open-air measurements were performed while holding the probe out at arm’s length into the air, 
verifying that the sensors are a distance away from any other objects that may affect the measurement.  
The water measurements were taken with the sensors inside the water-tight access tube that was placed in 
a 10-in.-diameter cylindrical water vessel (Figure 4.1).  Table 4.1 presents the water and open-air 
measurement output for each sensor.

Calibration: The capacitance probe calibration documentation (Sentek Pty Ltd. 2001) provides a default 
calibration developed using sand, loam, and clay-loam soils.  This calibration was developed by 
performing nonlinear regression on frequency data for paired volumetric moisture content and 
capacitance sensor scales (Figure 4.2).  The default calibration is sufficient to show relative changes in 
soil-water content, which is the primary interest in this study.  The manufacturer’s developed calibration 
follows the form,

4.3 Heat-Dissipation Unit 
As explained by Scanlon et al. (2002), a variety of procedures can be used to calibrate heat-dissipation 
sensors.  The sole requirement is that the matric potential of the medium surrounding the sensor be known.  
Similar to the capacitance probe, there are two elements to the HDU calibration: 1) a normalization 
procedure to remove variation between the HDU sensors (the normalization of temperature rise is sensor 
specific, and thus all sensors need to be normalized) and 2) a calibration procedure to develop the 
relationship between soil matric potential and the normalized temperature rise measured by the HDU.  
This relationship is general for all the sensors, and hence only a selected few sensors need be used to 
develop this relationship. 
 
Normalization: Much of the HDU sensor-to-sensor variation is due to variation in the heater-ceramic 
contact.  If the same heating method and heating time is used for each HDU sensor, then the variation 
 
 
4.4
between sensors can be removed by normalizing the measurements.  A normalization procedure of Flint 
et al. (2002), described by Eq. (3.6), was used to calculate a dimensionless temperature rise. These 
procedures are summarized in Appendix A.  The HDU temperature-rise measurement under dry 
conditions (ΔTd) was made after the HDU had been placed over oven-dried desiccant in a sealed container 
for a length of time (approximately 24 hours).  For the HDU temperature-rise measurement under water-
saturated conditions (ΔTw), the sensor was submerged in water for 24 to 48 hours and then removed 
before the HDU measurement.  Flint et al. (2002) report that this method of saturating the HDU is 
sufficient for conditions that will remain drier then -0.1 bar, which are the expected field conditions for 
this project.  All readings were taken with a constant line-heat source current of 50 mA and measurement 
times of 1 s and 30 s after HDU heating was initiated.  Table 4.2 summarizes the normalization results.

Calibration: The HDUs were calibrated in the laboratory across the range of expected field soil-water 
pressures using the procedures described in Appendix A.  The calibration was performed using a bucket 
packed with Hanford’s Warden silt loam and containing six HDUs and two tensiometers with pressure 
transducers for independent matric potential measurements (Figure 4.3).  Warden silt loam was used 
because its water-retention characteristics allow for creating soil-water matric potential over the desired 
range.  HDU calibration is independent of soil texture, permitting the use of Warden silt loam without 
introducing error into the calibration.   
 
 
4.5
 
The appropriate amount of soil and water was mixed together to attain the desired water content and 
hence desired matric potential.  Uniform mixing of the soil and water was achieved before packing the 
soil in the bucket.  During packing of the soil, the HDUs and tensiometers were added to the bucket, and 
soil was packed around the instruments.  After packing the bucket, the surface was covered to reduce 
evaporation. The HDUs and tensiometer pressure transducers were controlled by a single datalogger.  The 
HDU measurements were taken continuously for at least 24 hrs or until steady-state conditions were 
achieved, as indicated by HDU and tensiometer measurements.  HDU readings were taken with a 50 mA 
current applied to the heating element for 30 seconds.  After the measurement set was completed, the 
procedure was repeated for a different water content (matric potential).

Tensiometer pressure transducers are not present in this figure. 
 
Using the normalized HDU temperature rise and tensiometer readings under steady-state soil conditions, a 
calibration was developed by fitting a calibration curve to the paired matric potential and normalized 
HDU data points.  Figure 4.4 shows the paired data points and developed relationship between matric 
potential, ψ (m of water) and normalized HDU response, SΔT.  The dataset is best fit using a second-order 
polynomial equation described by:

4.4 Drain Gauge 
The manufacturer’s quality-control requirements state that each drain gauge is manufactured to dose at 
31 mL ±10%.(a)  This represents 1 mm of drainage for the 310-cm2 sampling area of the drain gauge.  In 
addition, drainage resolution of less than 1 mm can be attained by measuring the volume of water in the 
siphon chamber.  A calibration relating volume of water in the chamber, V (cm3), to the water-depth 
sensor output, WD (mV), is provided by the manufacture as (Decagon Devices, Inc. 2006):

Both calibrations will be used to convert drain-gauge output to drainage.  A drain-gauge dose will be 
considered 31 mL drainage, and volumes less than 31 mL will use the relationship in Eq. (4.3) to compute 
drainage water residing in the siphon chamber.   
 
Before installing the drain gauges in the field, each drain gauge was tested to verify that it was 
functioning.  Testing was achieved by slowly applying a known volume of water to the drain-gauge 
calibration line using a graduated 60-mL syringe while monitoring the gauge for dose events.  The 
volume of water applied for each dose was recorded and compared to the manufacturer’s stated 
calibration (31 mL per dose).  Table 4.3 presents results from the tests.  Due to the empty volume of the 
calibration line and the resolution of the syringe (0.5 mL), the differences between calibrated dosing 
volume and applied liquid were no more than 1.0 mL, which is less than the manufacturer’s suggested 
measurement error of ±10%.  The results support that the drain gauges were functioning before 
installation.

4.5 Temperature Probe 
The temperature probes come from the manufacturer already calibrated and do not require a field 
calibration.  Two different CSI models, Model 107 and Model 109, of temperature probes are used.  The 
Model 107 temperature probe is used as a reference temperature probe and is located within the enclosure 
boxes housing the dataloggers that control the instrument inside the T tank farm.  The Model 107 
temperature probe is described by a fifth-order polynomial equation relating thermistor resistance, Rs 
(Ohms), to temperature, T (°C) by (Campbell Scientific Inc. 2004),

4.6 Rain Gauge 
The rain gauge is factory calibrated and does not require a field calibration.  The calibration produces an 
equivalent height of water of 0.254 mm per tip.  Before field installation, the functionality of the rain 
gauge was confirmed by applying a known volume of water to the rain gauge with a graduated 60-mL 
syringe while monitoring for tips.  The volume of water applied for each tip was compared to the 
manufacturer’s calibration (8.3 mL per tip) to see that there was general agreement between the two.  
Table 4.4 presents results from this analysis.  Differences between the calibrated tipping volume and the 
volume of water applied were no more than the resolution volume of the syringe (0.5 mL).  The results 
confirm that the rain gauge is functioning.

5.0 Instrument Layout and Installation 
During August and September of 2006, two nests of vadose zone monitoring instruments were installed 
within T Tank Farm, and a meteorological station was installed outside of the tank farm.  Each of the two 
instrument nests within the tank farm included its own datalogger as did the meteorological station 
outside the farm.  This section updates the discussion in the design plan to represent any change and slight 
modifications to the installation procedure.  Adjustments to the locations of two additional nests planned 
for FY 2007 are also presented.   
5.1 Selection of Monitoring Locations 
The instruments are installed both under the interim surface barrier and outside of the surface barrier for 
purposes of monitoring surface-barrier impacts on the subsurface water regime.  Three-dimensional 
simulations presented in Section 2 and two-dimensional simulations(a) suggest that the measurable 
changes in subsurface conditions 3 years after surface barrier placement will primarily be contained in the 
top 15 m of sediment.  Longer time periods are required before measurable changes propagate to deeper 
depths.  As such, a combination of shallow and deep instrument placement is incorporated into the 
monitoring design.   
 
Nest placement is guided by three primary factors: 1) the capability to distinguish the differences in soil-
water regimes in the regions with and without a surface barrier, 2) the capability to investigate edge 
effects, and 3) the locations of existing underground utilities (e.g., pipelines, electrical conduits) or 
structures and the geometry of the planned interim surface barrier.  The nest placement should provide the 
greatest opportunity for monitoring instruments to detect changing subsurface soil-water conditions.  For 
example, in the region with a surface barrier, the water content of the soil close to or between tanks is 
expected to have a larger change than the soil far away from the tanks.  
 
Those designing a monitoring system also need to consider that soil attributes may vary in space.  This 
requires that the monitoring of a flow variable should be taken at multiple locations, if possible.  There 
are three options for repetitive measurements: 1) multiple measurements horizontally, 2) multiple 
measurements vertically, and 3) multiple measurements both horizontally and vertically.  Other factors to 
be considered include the cost constraint for instrument purchase, installation and monitoring, the method 
of installation, and the depth of a surface barrier that affects the soil-water regime within the time frame 
of monitoring.  The use of options 1) and 3) are more costly than option 2) to achieve similar 
measurement repetition.  Hence, option 2) is used for instrument placement.  
 
Horizontally, the instruments are grouped into four nests (i.e., A, B, C, and D), each of which includes a 
neutron access tube, a capacitance probe, and an HDU.  Nest A is placed in the area without a cover and 
serves as a control.  It needs to be at least 5 m away from the closest edge of the surface cover to prevent 
measurable impacts from the cover.  Nest B is placed at the edge of the surface barrier to monitor the 
edge effect of the surface barrier on the soil-water regime.  Each Nest (A and B) also contains a water-
flux meter.  Nests C and D are duplicates and are placed inside the covered area; they need be at least 5 m 
from the closest edge of the surface barrier and between two or more tanks where the largest change of 
soil-water content, and hence water flux, is expected after the emplacement of the surface barrier.

5.2
 
Vertically, the monitoring depths go to 15-m bgs.  Considering that, upon the emplacement of the surface 
barrier, the changes of soil moisture will be more significant in shallower depths; more intensive and 
frequent measurement will be taken in small depths. 
5.2 Instrument Nest Design 
As described above, the design groups instruments and access tubes into four nests, with each nest being 
composed of a vertical access tube for neutron-moisture-probe measurements, an EnviroSMART 
capacitance probe, and HDU units.  In addition, each Nest (A and B) contains a drain gauge.  Figure 5.1 
provides a plan view of the existing instrument nest locations (A and B), the prospective location for two 
additional instrument Nests C and D to be installed in FY 2007, and the probable footprint of the interim 
surface barrier.  After surface-barrier placement, Nest A will continue to provide subsurface conditions 
outside the surface barrier area.  Nest B, at the edge of the surface barrier, will provide subsurface 
measurements that are aimed to explore the magnitude of surface-barrier edge effects.  Nests C and D will 
serve as a redundant measurement of conditions beneath the interim surface barrier at locations where 
subsurface hydraulic conditions are anticipated to exhibit the greatest change, as supported by model 
results.  All present and future instrument nests lie within backfill material, except for the lower part of 
the neutron access tubes, which extend into the undisturbed Hanford formation below the tanks.   
 
Nests A and B were installed in late FY 2006, and monitoring was initiated on September 29, 2006.  
Figure 5.1 shows the approximate location of each instrument installation.  Table 5.1 provides the 
coordinates of each well using the Washington Coordinate System, NAD83(91) datum.  Nests A and B 
will provide baseline conditions before installing the interim surface barrier, anticipated to occur in the 
summer of 2007.  Nests A and B are installed at a separation distance of approximately 20 m, with Nest A 
being outside the proposed surface-barrier area, and Nest B being near the edge of the surface barrier.  
Both nests are approximately 11 m from the nearest tank.  
 
Nests C and D are planned to be installed in FY 2007.  Nests C and D will be inside the surface-barrier 
area, with Nest C being between tank T106 and T109, and Nest D located approximately at the center of 
the interim surface barrier, between tanks T105, T106, T108, and T109 (Figure 5.1).  The instrumentation 
and configuration of both nests will be identical in design to Nests A and B, except that Nests C and D 
will not include a drain gauge.  The final instrument composition of Nests C and D will be a vertical 
access tube for neutron-moisture-probe measurements, an EnviroSMART capacitance probe, and HDU 
units.  Table 5.2 summarizes the vertical placement of instrument or measurement points. The sensor 
serial numbers and/or sensor numbers for the capacitance and HDU sensors are listed in Table 5.3 and 
Table 5.4, respectively.  
 
In addition to the instrument nests, some of the existing dry wells located in the T Farm may be neutron 
logged, provided the wells have a favorable completion design.  These data may provide information 
regarding the soil-water condition in the regions that are not monitored by the above-mentioned 
instrument nests.  The following wells appear to be suitable for neutron logging: 50-08-11, 50-05-04, 
50-09-01, 50-08-08, 50-11-11, and 50-08-19 (Figure 5.2).

5.3 FY 2006 Instrument Installation 
In FY 2006, instrument Nests A and B were installed following the placement and methods described 
below.  Instruments were placed in an open driving borehole created by pounding a cone-tipped hollow 
drive shaft into the ground using a hydraulic hammer.  Figure 5.3 shows a typical cone-tipped drive shaft 
used for driving boreholes.  The benefit of using the hydraulic hammer to create a borehole as opposed to 
drilling is that the hydraulic-hammer technique avoids bringing potentially contaminated soil to the 
surface.  The cone tip on the drive shaft has the capability to be removed once the desired driving depth is 
reached.  This allows instruments to be placed down the borehole through the inside of the drive shaft as 
the drive shaft is removed from the soil.  Likewise, the drive shaft can remain in the soil as a permanent 
access tube.  The diameter of the borehole can be increased or decreased using differing drive-shaft and 
drive-head diameters. 
 
The following discussion provides specific details of each instrument installation and is adapted from 
Zhang and Keller (2006) to reflect installation modifications.  Both metric and English units of 
measurement are reported in this section to be consistent with the English units used by the drillers to 
measure and report depths and instrument-installation details.

5.3.1 Neutron-Moisture-Probe Access Tubes 
Each neutron-probe access tube was installed using the basic function of the hydraulic hammer.  A steel 
access tube 4.45 cm ID, 6.35 cm OD (1.75 inch ID, 2.5 inch OD) was driven vertically by the hydraulic 
hammer to a depth of 15.24 m (50 ft).  A cap on the access tube is used to prevent precipitation from 
 
 
5.6
entering the access tube.  Figure 5.5 shows the diagram of the installed neutron-probe access tubes and 
installation procedures. 
5.3.2 EnviroSMART Capacitance Probe 
To allow the capacitance probe access tube with a 5.65 cm (2.22 inch OD) to be placed into the ground 
through the drive shaft, an 8.48 cm (3.34 inch) ID drive rod was used.  The OD of this drive shaft was 
10.16 cm (4.00 inches), resulting in an annulus of 4.51 cm (1.78 inches).  At both instrument nests, the 
drive rod was driven to a depth of approximately 3.50 m (11.50 ft).  Once the target depth was reached, 
the drive cone was detached from the shaft, and the cone was isolated from the capacitance probe by 
surrounding it with 20/40 clean sand until the borehole depth was approximately 2.83 m (9.28 ft).  The 
EnviroSMART PVC access tube was then placed at depth through the drive rod, with the top of the probe 
being approximately 0.30 m (0.98 ft) below ground surface.  As the drive rod was extracted, 20/40 clean 
sand was packed in the annulus surrounding the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) access tube.   
 
The drive-rod diameter was selected to create as small of an annulus as possible.  However, the annulus 
size still required packing the 20/40 sand around the access tube to eliminate any air gaps around the 
access tube.  Keeping the size of the annulus to a minimum was important so that the measured moisture 
content of the capacitance probe is not heavily skewed by the moisture content of the packing material.  
The manufacturer of the probe states that 99% of the probe reading is taken within a 10-cm radius from 
the outside of the capacitance-probe access tube.  Given that the radial thickness of the 20/40 clean sand  
packed in the annulus is 4.51 cm (1.78 inches), this 
suggests that approximately 45% of the capacitance-
probe reading is interrogating the 20/40 clean-sand 
material.  While the sand pack will skew absolute soil-
water-content values, relative trends over depth and 
time will still be valuable. 
 
Near the top of the borehole, an approximately 5 cm 
(1.97 inches) thick layer of hydrated bentonite  
crumbles was added to the annulus to reduce the 
potential for preferential flow through the 20/40 sand 
pack material.  After the PVC access tube and packing 
material was emplaced, accumulated soil and dust 
within the access tube was removed, and the sensors 
were placed within the access tube as was desiccant.  
The access tube was then capped and sealed with a 
water-tight and weather-resistant sealant.   
 
To protect the probe from surface traffic, a 25.4-cm 
(10-inch) diameter steel casing was placed around the access tube, extending from the surface to a depth 
of 0.30 m (1 ft).  The casing was then filled with soil material from the tank farm surface.  Figure 5.4 
shows the capacitance probe cap and protective casing before filling the casing with the tank-farm surface 
material, while Figure 5.7 shows a diagram of the installed capacitance probe access tubes and installation 
procedures.

5.3.3 Heat-Dissipation Units 
HDUs were installed within a borehole created by driving a 4.45-cm-ID, 6.35-cm-OD (1.75–inch-ID, 
2.5–inch-OD) steel drive shaft and drive head set to a depth of 10.97 m (36.0 ft) using the hydraulic 
hammer.  Figure 5.8 provides a representation of the packing material and instrument layering scheme for 
installing the HDUs within the borehole.  Once the drive shaft was at depth, the drive cone was 
disconnected from the drive shaft, and as the rod was removed, 20/40 clean sand was added to bring the 
level to approximately 10.0 cm (3.9 inches) below the bottom HDU depth of 10.0 m (32.8 ft).  The HDU 
and silica flour were added for a total of 20.0-cm (7.9-inches) thickness of silica flour.  Silica flour was 
packed around the HDU to supply optimum contact between the sensor and surrounding soil material.  
The silica flour was moistened slightly before adding to the borehole to improve packing of the flour and 
to reduce HDU equilibration time with the surrounding sediment.  Approximately 20.0 cm (7.9 inches) of 
20/40 sand was then added on top of the silica flour, followed by hydrated bentonite crumbles to a depth 
of approximately 30.0 cm (11.8 inches) below the next instrument depth of 5.0 m (16.4 ft).  20/40 sand 
was added to bring the level to approximately 10.0 cm (3.9 inches) below the instrument depth.  The next 
HDU and silica flour was then added as was done with the previous HDU.  This sequence was repeated 
until all HDUs were installed.  After the last HDU was installed, 20.0 cm (7.9 inches) of 20/40 clean sand 
was added before the borehole was completed to the surface with hydrated bentonite crumbles.  A 
representation of this packing scheme is presented in Figure 5.8.  To protect wiring and instruments from 
vehicle traffic, a 20.3-cm (8.0-inches) diameter steel casing was placed over the borehole to a depth 
extending 0.30 m (1.0 ft) below the soil surface, and the casing was capped.  Figure 5.6 shows the HDU 
installation before placing a cap on the protective casing.  Note the HDU cabling that runs to the 
datalogger.

5.3.4 Drain Gauge 
The drain gauge has a 20.3-cm (8.0-inch) OD divergence control tube that is 0.67 m (2.2 feet) in length, 
requiring a hole of this diameter to be created from the surface to a depth of 0.67 m (2.2 feet).  An auger 
was employed to create a sufficiently large diameter hole to allow placement of the divergence control 
tube.  To preserve the hole while auguring, a 25.4-cm (10-inch) diameter casing was advanced as the 
auguring proceeded.  The sediment removed during auguring was set aside to be used later to pack the 
divergence control tube.  After auguring to the correct depth, a 4.45-cm-ID, 6.35-cm-OD (1.75-inch-ID, 
2.5-inch-OD) drive shaft and drive-head combination was pushed, starting from the base of the augured 
hole to a depth of approximately 1.2 m (4 ft) past the base of the auger hole.  The hole was pushed 
multiple times until it maintained its structure when the drive shaft was removed.  Gravel was added to 
the bottom of the smaller diameter borehole until approximately 0.30-m (1-ft) depth of gravel was present.  
The gravel allows for unabated movement of the dosing water away from the drain gauge.  The wick 
section of the drain gauge was then placed inside the smaller diameter borehole with the top plate of the  
wick section resting on the bottom of the auger hole.  A 2-cm-thick (0.79-inches) layer of manufacturer-
provided diatomaceous earth was placed on top of the fiberglass fabric that covers the top plate to 
enhance contact between the soil in the divergence control tube and the fiberglass wick.  The divergence 
control tube was then securely placed on the top plate of the wick section and packed with the augured 
out soil.  The drain gauges were placed at both nests so that the divergence control tube and steel casing 
terminated at ground surface, with the steel casing remaining to provide an added level of protection for 
the drain gauge.  Figure 5.9 shows the drain gauge at instrument Nest B before the surface material was

packed.  In this figure, the drain gauge is the smaller diameter tube, and the larger diameter tube is the 
protective casing.  The clear tube coming from the drain gauge is a calibration tube that allows for 
calibration of the unit after it has been installed and allows the functionality of the unit to be checked.  
The blue tube can be used to extract a solution sample from the unit if desired.  Figure 5.10 shows a 
diagram of the installed drainage gauges and installation procedures.

5.3.5 Datalogger and Wiring 
Each instrument nest within the tank farm will be connected to a dedicated datalogger adjacent to the 
instrument nest.  Wiring from each instrument is run through buried conduit that terminates at a transfer 
box.  The wiring then runs from the transfer box to the datalogger enclosure box through a single line of 
conduit.  The datalogger is installed in a weather-tight enclosure containing desiccant bags to reduce 
moisture inside the box.  The enclosure and transfer box is attached to a 6-foot-tall galvanized steel tripod 
that is securely anchored using 12-inch-long rebar ground stakes.  The tripod is grounded to a 5-inch 
grounding rod. 
 
The datalogger and peripherals are powered by a 12-volt rechargeable battery, which is charged by a solar 
panel attached to the tripod.  The battery is placed within the enclosure.  Data from the datalogger are 
transmitted remotely by a 900-MHz spread spectrum radio to a receiving computer located outside of the 
tank farm.  Figure 5.11 shows the datalogger enclosure and other infrastructure associated with the 
datalogger station controlling instrument Nest B.  Each instrument nest is surrounded by T-posts and rope 
to deter vehicle traffic.  Figure 5.13 shows the wiring diagram for the instrument nests inside the T tank 
farm.  The wiring for Nests A and B are identical.

5.3.6 Meteorological Station 
The meteorological station was installed along the north fence line, just outside of the T tank farm.  The 
datalogger and meteorological instruments are mounted on a 6-foot-tall galvanized steel tripod that is 
securely anchored using 12-inch-long rebar ground stakes.  The datalogger controlling the instruments is 
placed inside a weather-resistant enclosure.  The datalogger is powered by a 12-volt rechargeable battery 
that is charged by a solar panel attached to the tripod.  The battery is placed within the enclosure.  Data 
from the datalogger are transmitted remotely by a 900-MHz spread spectrum radio to a receiving 
computer.  Figure 5.12 shows the meteorological station instruments and control components.  A smaller 
version of the wiring diagram for T Tank Farm Instrument Nests and the meteorological station (CHG 
2006) is presented in Figure 5.13.

6.0 Vadose Zone Monitoring Plan 
A monitoring plan is presented that uses the monitoring design described in Section 5.0 that will be used 
to document vadose zone response to the placement of an interim surface barrier in the T tank farm.  The 
monitoring plan employs the measurement of subsurface hydraulic conditions directly beneath and 
outside of the interim surface barrier as well as meteorological conditions.  This section details aspects of 
the monitoring plan, including: 
• 
the source, method, frequency, and schedule of data collection 
• 
data reduction, validation, organization, and analysis 
• 
instrument performance and vadose zone response indicators 
• 
contingencies given instrument failure 
• 
data reporting. 
6.1 Measurement Procedures and Frequencies 
This section describes the standard procedures to be used for collecting data under the monitoring design 
described in Section 5.0 as well as the measurement schedule.  Table 6.1 summarizes the six variables to 
be monitored, the monitoring methods, and the approximate monitoring frequency.  The monitoring 
procedures and frequency may be adjusted as more experience is gained.

(a) All measurements except neutron probe will be controlled by dataloggers and 
taken automatically.  The data will be transmitted to the project server on a 
weekly basis. 
 
Neutron-moisture-probe measurements will be performed manually.  The measurements will initially be 
made about every 3 months, but may vary according to the needs and the variation of soil-water content.  
Following the neutron-probe-measurement procedure documented in CHG (Ross 2007), profile 
measurements will be made at 1-foot intervals to the depths of the access tubes.     
 
The datalogger will control the probe and store the measurement data of moisture content from 
capacitance sensors, soil-water pressure and soil temperature from HDUs, drainage from the drain gauges, 
precipitation from the rain gauge, and air temperature from the thermister.  Soil-moisture-content 
measurements made with the capacitance probe and HDU measurements to monitor soil-water pressure

and soil temperature will be taken once or more every 6 hours.  At this measurement frequency, a fully 
charged battery can last for approximately 30 days without being charged by the solar panel.  A concern 
for a more frequent measurement is that the HDU may drain too much power from the battery, especially 
in the winter months when cloud cover reduces the capability of the solar panel to charge the battery.  Air 
temperature in the meteorological station will be measured every hour or shorter considering that air 
temperature changes quicker than other variables.  Both precipitation and water flux will be measured 
continuously, but the former is reported hourly.  The data will be transmitted to the project server on a 
weekly basis.  
6.2 Data Management 
Given the variety and volume of data to be collected, it is critical that the data generated under the 
monitoring plan be consistently managed in a high-quality format and continuously validated.  Doing so 
allows for reliable routine review and assessment of the functionality of the sensors.  The following 
sections discuss the review and archival of raw data collected by the instrument/datalogger, the reduction 
of the data into meaningful parameter quantities, and data validation.  
6.2.1 Raw Data Review and Archival 
The data from the dataloggers are treated as raw data.  These data will be reviewed before they are 
archived in a central server.  In the case when the data are not complete, the data will be re-retrieved from 
the dataloggers.  The data from the dataloggers will be in ASCII format.  The files from the instrument 
nests will have the same or similar format as described below. However, the file formats are subject to 
change if needed. The actual format of each data file will be described in a data-configuration-information 
file, which is prepared when a data file is archived. 
• 
The file contains multiple rows of comma-delimited data measured at different times. The 
comma-delimited values correspond to the following variables sequentially:  
o Columns 1 to 5: Array No., Year, Day of year, Hour/Min, Seconds 
o Columns 6 to 7: Battery voltage (V), Reference temperature (°C) 
o Columns 8 to 11: HDU initial temperature at 1, 2, 5, 10 m bgs (°C) 
o Columns 12 to 15: Temperature difference between 1 sec and 30 sec for HDUs at 1, 2, 5, 
10 m bgs (°C) 
o Columns 16 to 20: Capacitance-probe scaled frequency from sensors at 0.6, 0.9, 1.3, 1.8, and 
2.3 m bgs 
o Columns 21 to 25: Capacitance probe soil-moisture content from sensors at 0.6, 0.9, 1.3, 1.8, 
and 2.3 m bgs (volume %) 
o Columns 26 and 27: Number of drain gauge doses and siphon water level (mV) 
• 
The file from the Meteorological Station contains the comma-delimited values corresponding to 
the following variables sequentially: 
o Column 1: Date/Time 
o Column 2: Record number 
o Column 3: Battery voltage (V) 
o Column 4: Rain gauge (inch) 
 
 
6.3
o Column 5: Air temperature (deg C). 
 
Note that in case measurement frequencies do not match, the same value for the less-frequent 
measurements will be repeated to keep the same data format as described above.  Should there be 
additional data output, they will be added after the above mentioned data items in a row. 
6.2.2 Data Reduction and Organization 
All monitoring data to be collected require a calibration to relate the measured instrument output of an 
electric signal to a meaningful parameter value.  In the case a calibration is not available for the neutron 
probe, relative values will be derived. In instances where the instrument calibration is stable and will not 
change with time, the datalogger will perform the calculation, and the calculated value will be included in 
the data file.  For other instruments, the application of the calibration equation will be done through post 
processing of the data file.  Applying the calibration during post processing allows for the datalogger data 
file to remain consistent in terms of output fields and to derive the values in the data file. 
 
Data collected under the monitoring plan will be managed in a centralized electronic database repository.  
The database will be backed up daily using an automated back-up routine.  Except for the neutron 
moisture probe data, data will be automatically or manually downloaded from the datalogger to the 
project server using a combination of radio-frequency telemetry and/or telephone communication.  Data 
are to be downloaded from the datalogger to the project server approximately once a week.  Neutron-
moisture-probe data will be copied to the project server after measurements are made.  Templates (e.g., 
using MathCad, EXCEL) will be used to apply the specific instrument calibration and to produce time 
series plots of the data.  The processed data and plots will be stored in the project server.  Figure 6.1 
presents a flow diagram describing the monitoring components, instrumentation, and data collection and 
management. 
6.2.3 Data Validation 
Monitoring data that have been copied to the central server will be screened regularly for anomalies by 
comparing recent data to historical data and using performance indicators defined in the next section.  
Anomalous data will be flagged and further investigated following procedures identified in the data-
analysis section.  If the data are proven to be erroneous, the data will either be corrected, if possible, or 
noted as suspect.  Generally, the data will be validated approximately quarterly, but the validation 
frequency may be adjusted as more experience is gained. 
6.3 Data Analysis 
Data analysis will be consistent with the purpose, goals, and objectives of the interim-surface-barrier 
monitoring plan to assess the performance of the interim barrier.  Data represent measurements at selected 
monitoring locations at selected times and include soil-water content, soil-water pressure, soil temperature, 
soil drainage, and meteorological conditions.

Figure 6.1.  Monitoring Components, Instrumentation, and Data  
Collection and Management Flow Diagram 
 
This section provides a general discussion of the analysis and assessment of the measurement data, with 
an emphasis on instrument performance indicators and vadose zone response indicators.  If necessary to 
better represent subsurface conditions, performance indicators may be revised in the future in response to 
measured background data.  The data will be summarized in reports that will include tabular and 
graphical summaries of the monitoring data.  The reports will identify any potentially significant 
anomalies that may require attention.   
6.3.1 Instrument Performance Indicators and Contingencies 
Performance indicators to evaluate instrument functionality are presented.  Unmet performance indicators 
may be a result of real unexpected subsurface conditions, data-transmittal error, post-processing error, or 
instrument malfunction.  In the case of unexpected subsurface conditions, the performance indicators may 
require adjustment after baseline data are collected.  For instances when performance indicators are not 
met, suggested troubleshooting methods are presented as are contingencies.  Table 6.2 summarizes the 
performance indicators outlined in this section.

Neutron Moisture Probe 
Indicators of neutron-probe performance can be acquired using a standard count analysis.  A standard 
count is to be taken before neutron logging as described in Section 2.1.  From this analysis, the ratio of 
the measured standard deviation to the ideal standard deviation, also called the chi-squared test, is 
calculated and for a properly functioning probe should be between 0.75 and 1.25.  If the ratio consistently 
falls outside these limits, then the probe may be experiencing problems.  In addition, the new standard 
count should be within the previous standard count ±0.98 times the square-root of the previous standard 
count.  A standard count outside of this range is an indication that the probe may not be functioning 
correctly.    
 
Appendix A and B of the CPN International users manual (CPN International) and the CHG procedure 
guide (Ross 2007) provide a list of error messages and their meanings as well as a troubleshooting guide.  
In addition to the information provided in this document, troubleshooting should include evaluating the 
post processing of the data to verify that the error does not exist in this step.  If problems with the neutron 
probe are not correctable, another neutron probe may be used.   
 
Capacitance Probe 
 
The capacitance-probe performance can be examined using published information (e.g., from the Hanford 
vadose zone hydrogeology data package by Last et al. 2006).  The saturated moisture content value serves 
as the upper-boundary indicator for capacitance-probe-measured moisture content.  Alternatively, a 
moisture content of zero is set as the lower boundary indicator for the probe.  Measurements of 
capacitance-probe moisture content that fall outside these established boundaries may be considered 
suspect.  Because of subsurface heterogeneities, property uncertainties, and calibration errors, 
capacitance-probe performance will be reevaluated after sufficient baseline capacitance probe data are 
acquired. 
 
 
 
6.6
If the capacitance-probe measurements do not meet the indicators specified, follow the suggested 
troubleshooting steps presented in Appendix B to identify the problem.  If the problem still cannot be 
solved, remove the capacitance probe from its access tube and visually inspect the probe for damage and 
moisture accumulation.  Replace sensors on the probe and test, and/or bring the probe in from the field for 
additional examination and possible repair.   
 
If the above steps do not produce a reasonable result, a new probe can be installed using the existing 
access tube.   
 
Heat Dissipation Unit 
 
Soil-water pressures over the depth of measurement should not be greater than zero, indicating full 
saturation.  However, there is no minimum for soil-water pressure theoretically.  In this monitor plan, the 
HDU measurement range of soil-water pressure, from -1 m to -100 m, is used as the performance 
indicators.  Because of subsurface heterogeneities and property uncertainties, HDU performance will be 
reevaluated after sufficient baseline capacitance probe data are acquired.     
 
A 50-year monitoring record of soil temperature (Hoitink et al. 2005) in a bare surfaced gravelly sand soil 
near the HMS provides a range and of soil temperatures to expect in T tank farm.  At the 0.9-m depth, the 
Hoitink et al. (2005) data show that hourly extremes at this site were a minimum temperature of 0.1 °C 
and a maximum of 29.6 °C.  Given the observed results, soil-temperature measurements at a 1-m depth or 
deeper should not exceed 30°C and should not be less than 0°C.  After baseline HDU data are acquired, 
this performance indicator may be adjusted based on the HDU measurements. However, depending on the 
color, the surface barrier may transmit heat into the sub-surface soil that may exceed 30C. So, it is 
expected that thermal regime under the surface barrier may be quite different than that outside the barrier.    
   
If the HDU soil-water pressure or soil temperature measurements do not meet the indicators specified, 
follow the suggested troubleshooting steps presented in Appendix B to identify the problem.  If the above 
steps do not produce a functioning probe, the installation of new HDUs may be necessary.   
 
Drain Gauge 
 
In the region without a barrier, drainage should not exceed the annual precipitation for that year, unless 
there is focused flow to the drain gauge due to either a rapid snowmelt event in winter, or possibly a berm 
failure at the edge of the poly sheet, potentially causing a surface flood after a torrential rainstorm 
(extreme event).  Both conditions are highly unlikely but rapid snowmelt has caused flooding of tank 
farm surfaces in the past and this condition needs to be recognized.  The lower bound of drainage is zero, 
which means no flux at all.  
 
If the drain-gauge measurements do not meet the indicators specified, confirm if the output from the drain 
gauge when receiving a voltage excitation is between an appropriate range and follow the suggested 
troubleshooting steps presented in Appendix B to identify the problem.  If the problem still cannot be 
solved, apply water to the calibration line to see if a flushing event is observed.   
 
If the above steps do not produce a functioning gauge, a new drain gauge may need to be installed. 
 
 
 
 
6.7
Precipitation and Air Temperature   
 
Performance bounds for the rain-gauge and air-temperature sensors are set relative to those at the HMS.  
For calendar year 2004, the most recent year that Hanford climate data are documented, annual 
precipitation and annual average temperature measured at the 200W monitoring station varied -35.3% and 
-1.3%, respectively, from those measured at the HMS (Hoitink et al. 2005).  Using this information, the 
annual precipitation data measured at T tank farm should not vary more than ±50% of the HMS 
precipitation.  Likewise, the T tank farm annual average air-temperature data should not vary greater than 
±5% of the HMS-measured annual average temperature. 
 
If the rain-gauge or air-temperature measurements do not meet the indicators specified, follow the 
suggested troubleshooting steps presented in Appendix B to identify the problem.  If the problem of the 
rain gauge still cannot be solved, apply water to the rain gauge to see if a tipping event is observed.   
 
If the above steps do not produce a functioning gauge or thermister, the instrument may be removed and 
sent to the manufacturer for repair, or a new instrument may need to be installed. 
6.3.2 Vadose Zone Response Indicators 
Vadose zone response will be monitored by examining systematic changes of subsurface conditions over 
time as represented by time-history trends at the monitoring locations.  The trends in subsurface 
conditions beneath the interim surface barrier will be used to help answer whether the surface barrier 
significantly and adequately reduces the downward flux of soil water relative to background conditions.  
The monitoring plan calls for the direct measurement of downward soil-water flux using drain gauges and 
indirect measurements using soil-water content and soil-water pressure data.   
 
The drain gauges at Nests A and B were installed at the soil surface and measure the drainage at 0.6 m 
below the soil surface.  The time-history trend of soil-water content below the surface barrier will provide 
additional information about the effectiveness of the surface barrier in reducing soil-water flux.  An 
effective surface barrier will produce, on average, a drying soil profile beneath the surface barrier, 
representing a decrease in soil-water flux.  Decreasing soil-water flux will also be portrayed by decreasing 
soil-water pressure relative to baseline conditions.  However, it is pointed out that, at very shallow depth, 
the soil can be completely dry in the summer time when the surface barrier will be emplaced.  Then, a 
redistribution of soil water below the surface barrier will occur, and soil moisture will move upward from 
the wetter soil at deeper depths to the drier soil in shallow depth until a new equilibrium condition is 
established. 
 
A clear vadose zone response indicator is a near-surface instrument response after precipitation or snow 
melt events.  Adequate surface-barrier performance should result in no observable increases in moisture 
content, drainage, or soil-water pressure (less negative) immediately after precipitation or snow-melt 
events.  Such instrument responses would indicate percolating water and general surface-barrier failure, 
provided the instruments are functioning. 
 
A secondary component of surface barrier performance is the potential advective movement and buildup 
of water vapor immediately beneath the low-permeable surface barrier.  Condensation of the water vapor 
would result in increased soil-water content immediately below the surface barrier.  The vaporization-
condensation process does not indicate any problem of the surface barrier because there is no net gain or 
 
 
6.8
loss of water mass across the barrier. The seasonal water movement that might observed by the 
capacitance probe monitoring, will most likely be due to thermally induced vapor and liquid flow as 
described above and it is expected that this fluctuation will persist for the life of the barrier.  The 
magnitude of the water content changes and the depth of penetration depend on the soil type and initial 
water content of the soil, but for typical Hanford conditions it should not extend deeper than a few 10s of 
cm into the subsurface. 
 
 
 
7.1
 
7.0 Quality Assurance 
To verify the quality of the project, the organization performing the monitoring will be required to have a 
project management plan (PMP) and a quality assurance plan (QAP).  Quality specialists will provide 
quality assurance support for the project.  Project members will be required to follow the PMP and QAP.

 A.1
 
Appendix A: Heat Dissipation Unit Probe Normalization and 
Calibration Procedures 
This procedure is adapted from HDU normalization and calibration procedures discussed in Scanlon et al. 
(2002) and Flint et al. (2002). 
 
Normalization 
 
1. Place oven dried desiccant and one or more HDUs in a sealed container and allow to equilibrate 
for a minimum of 24 hours.  If the HDU ceramic has been previously wetted, the HDU is best 
dried in an oven not to exceed 60°C.     
2. Measure temperature rise a HDU using the same heat source current and heating time to be used 
for the field measurements.  This is the temperature rise for dry ceramic (ΔTd). Repeat Step 2 for 
other HDUs. 
3. Place one or more HDUs in deaired water and allow to equilibrate for a minimum of 24 hours. 
4. Remove a HDU from water and immediately measure HDU temperature rise using the same heat 
source current and heating time to be used for the field measurements.  This is the temperature 
rise for saturated ceramic (ΔTw). Repeat Step 4 for other HDUs. 
 
Calibration 
1. Wet soil to desired soil water pressure condition.  Wet soil by thoroughly mixing soil and added 
water.  The amount of water needed to obtain a specified soil water pressure condition can be 
approximated with prior knowledge of the soil’s soil water characteristics curve and the mass of 
soil. 
2. Obtain a minimum of two tensiometers to provide an independent reading of soil water pressure. 
3. Pack wetted soil, HDUs and tensiometers into a bucket of five gallons or larger.  A minimum of 
three HDUs should be used to obtain the calibration. 
4. Seal the top of the bucket to reduce evaporative water loss from the soil. 
5. Measure HDU temperature rise using the same heat source current and heating time to be used for 
the field measurements. 
6. Measure tensiometer pressure. 
7. Once HDU temperature rise and tensiometer pressure measurements stabilize, record tensiometer 
pressure and HDU temperature rise.  This is one calibration point.    
8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 with a different soil water content until all desired calibration points are 
obtained.  Obtain a minimum of three calibration points.  The calibration points should span the 
anticipated HDU measurement range in the field.   
9. Fit appropriate calibration curve to paired soil water pressure and normalized HDU data points.

Appendix B: Suggested Troubleshooting Procedures 
If measurements from an instrument or a sensor do not meet the indicators specified, the following 
suggested troubleshooting steps should be taken in the order presented.  Note that troubleshooting Steps 1 
through 3 are performed outside the tank farm.  If Steps 1 through 3 do not resolve the issue, entrance into 
the tank farm is required for further troubleshooting. 
1. Review the post processing procedure to verify that the error does not reside in this step. 
2. Check the battery voltage data for power supply. 
3. Check the datalogger program for potential program error. 
4. Manually download the data from the datalogger to confirm that the data error is not created 
during remote data transmittal to the server. 
5. Check the datalogger ports to confirm that they are functioning. 
6. Inspect the wiring and connections at the datalogger for disconnections or wiring wear. 
7. Inspect the wiring coming out of the top of the probe for disconnection or wiring wear. 
8. Test the wiring from the probe to the datalogger for continuity.
