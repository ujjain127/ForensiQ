IODINE—2001
38.1
IODINE
By Phyllis A. Lyday
Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Christopher H. Lindsay, statistical assistant, and the world production
table was prepared by Regina R. Coleman, international data coordinator.
Two producers of crude iodine supplied about one-quarter of
domestic demand in 2001 based on reported figures (table 1). 
Domestic and imported iodine was consumed in intermediate
products prior to being sold to consumers (table 2).  Iodine and
derivatives find principal uses in pharmaceutical and medical
applications, sanitation or disinfectants, animal feed, catalysts,
inks, colorants, photographic equipment, and stabilizers. 
Published prices for crude iodine were unchanged from 2000
(table 3).  Imports of crude iodine increased by 5%, and imports
of potassium iodide increased by 8% (table 4).  End uses for
domestic consumption in 2001 decreased because of a lower
number of plants reporting.  Exports of crude iodine increased
by 45% and exports of potassium iodide increased by 9%
during 2001 (table 5).  Because some exports and imports are in
product categories rather than crude products, net imports are
not clearly distinguished.  In Chile, iodine is a coproduct of
sodium nitrate production.  Japan produced iodine from brines
associated with natural gas production (table 6).  World iodine
usage was estimated as follows:  x-ray contrast media, 23%;
iodophors and biocides, 17%; chemicals, 17%, organic
compounds, 12%; pharmaceuticals, 8%; human nutrition, 8%;
nylon, 6%; animal feeds, 5%; and herbicides 4% (Sociedad
Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, 2001).
Legislation and Government Programs
The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public
Law 107-107), which was enacted December 28, 2001,
continued the funding of $150 million ($50 million each) of the
operation and maintenance accounts of the Army, Navy, and
Air Force by the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) Transaction
Fund.  The law required the sale of authorized commodities that
would result in receipts of $100 million during the 5 fiscal years
ending September 30, 2004, and $300 million during the 10
fiscal years ending September 30, 2009.  The Annual Materials
Plan for fiscal year 2002 authorized the disposal of 453,593
kilograms (kg) (1,000,000 pounds) of crude iodine from the
NDS classified as excess to the goal (U.S. Department of
Defense, 2001, p. 10).  Stocks of iodine classified as excess to
the goal at the end of fiscal year 2001 (September 30, 2001)
were all subject to disposal limits.  On October 29, 1999,
“Amendment No. 002 to the Solicitation” changed the sale of
the 453,593 kg to quarterly sales of 113,398 kg (250,000
pounds).  On October 12, 2000, the Defense National Stockpile
Center (DNSC) issued “Amendment No. 005 to Solicitation of
Offers for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)-Iodine-003” that
changed the dates for offerings to February 21, May 16, and
August 15, 2001.  On March 5, 2001, the DNSC announced the
sale of 9,070 kg (20,000 pounds) at a value of $115,000 ($12.68
per kilogram or $5.75 per pound) (Defense National Stockpile
Center, 2001a).  On June 8, 2001, the DNSC announced the sale
of 61,200 kg (135,000 pounds) at a value of $750,000 ($12.25
per kilogram or $5.56 per pound) (Defense National Stockpile
Center, 2001b).  On September 7, 2001, the DNSC announced
the sale of 13,600 kg (30,000 pounds) at a value of $165,000
($12.13 per kilogram or $5.50 per pound) (Defense National
Stockpile Center, 2001c).  At yearend, 83,900 kg (185,000
pounds) was sold valued at $1,030,000, and the excess iodine
was 1.69 million kg (Mkg) (3.73 million pounds) valued at
$23.7 million ($14.01 per kilogram or $6.35 per pound) (M.L.
Dick, Defense National Stockpile Center, written commun.,
August 21, 2001).
The U.S. Department of Justice’s Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) was considering tougher permit
requirements for selling chemicals that can be diverted to illegal
drug manufacture.  Iodine can be used to produce
methamphetamine.  U.S. companies are required to get permits
from DEA to sell List 1 chemicals, including iodine and 23
other compounds (Chemical & Engineering News, 2000).
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Service purchased about
10,000 potassium iodide pills from NukePills.com.  The pills
are sold in packages of 14 only over the Internet.  Another seller
of the pills is Rad-guard.com which sells 200 pills in a bottle. 
The pills are designed to be taken in the event of a radiological
event, such as an attack on a nuclear powerplant or a dirty
bomb.  The Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-
counter sales of potassium iodide in 1982.  It recommends that
anyone not allergic to iodine exposed to radioactive iodine take
one tablet daily for 10 to 14 days.  Doctors administering
radiation treatment to cancer patients take potassium iodide
regularly.  After the 1986 nuclear meltdown in the Soviet
Union, 30 million people who might have been exposed to
radiation took potassium iodide (Boyer and Gertz, 2002).
Recommended daily allowances of iodine were as follows: 
infants, 16 micrograms (mg); children 1 month to 3 years, 32
mg, and age 3 to 18, 65 mg; and adults over 18 and pregnant or
lactating women, 130 mg.  A quarter teaspoon of iodized table
salt provides 95 mg of iodine.  A 170-gram (6-ounce) portion of
ocean fish provides 650 mg of iodine.  Most people are able to
meet their iodine requirements by eating iodized salt, plants
grown in iodine-rich soil, seafood, and seaweed (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease
Control, 2002§1).
One of the standards that is used for iodine is set by U.S.
Pharmacopeia Convention Inc. (USPC).  USPC is a nonprofit,
nongovernment agency that promotes the public health by
establishing state-of-the-art standards that ensure high-quality

drugs for human and animal use, and it is a major element in
drug regulation.
At the UPCS’s first national convention, to bring some
rational order to the pharmaceutical industry, physicians made a
list of safe and effective drugs and published it in 1820 as the
U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP).  The USP was first revised in 1830
and every 10 years thereafter until 1970; since then, it has been
updated every 5 years; after 2002, it is to be revised annually. 
In 1973, USP purchased the National Formulary (NF) from the
American Pharmaceutical Association and combined the NF
with the USP.  The latest volume, “USP25-NF20,” was
published in 2001 and included officially recognized standards
for drugs and health care technologies (Ember, 2001).
Production
Domestic production data for iodine were derived from a
voluntary survey of U.S. operations by the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS).  The three companies to which a survey
request was sent responded, representing 100% of the total
production (tables 1, 6).
In 1987, IOCHEM Corp. began producing iodine by the
blowing-out process at a plant 1.2 kilometers (km) east of Vici,
Dewey County, OK.  IOCHEM, the largest U.S. plant, was
owned by the Kita family and Tomen Corp.  The majority of
production was shipped to Schering AG of Germany under a
long-term contract.  IOCHEM reported having nine production
wells and four injection wells with a total production capacity of
1,400 metric tons per year (t/yr) at Vici.
North American Brine Resources began operating one
miniplant at Dover in Kingfisher County, OK, in 1983.  In
December 1999, the management committee of North American
Brine adopted a formal plan to discontinue the business and
dispose of its assets.  Beard Co., which had a 40% ownership,
reported a loss as a result of the discontinued operation. 
Effective September 15, 2000, the majority of the assets and
liabilities of North American Brine were distributed to Beard
Co.  As of September 30, 2000, Beard’s remaining investment
in North American Brine was $66,000 (Beard Co., 2000§).  In
2001, the miniplant continued operating at an oilfield-injection-
disposal site.
Woodward Iodine Corp., which began production in 1977,
was purchased by Asahi Glass Co. of Japan in 1984 and sold to
Ise Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. of Japan in 1994.  Woodward’s
plant in Woodward County, OK, produced iodine from 22 brine
production wells, which used the blowing-out process, and
injected waste through 10 injection wells.  Mical Specialty
Chemicals, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi International Corp.),
was the exclusive distributor for iodine produced by
Woodward.
Consumption
In 2001, estimated end uses, by percentage, for iodine were as
follows:  sanitation, 45%; animal feed, 27%; pharmaceuticals,
10%; catalysts, 8%; heat stabilizers, 5%; and other, 5%.  Other
smaller uses included inks and colorants, photographic
chemicals, laboratory reagents, production of batteries,
high-purity metals, motor fuels, and lubricants (table 2).
A paper presented at the Forum on Iodine Utilization by
Tatsuo Kaiho of Mitsui Chemicals Inc., summarized the novel
applications for iodine and the compounds used, which include
biocide (dimehtyl trisulfide and 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl
carbonate), disinfectant (polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine), mineral
supplement for iodine deficiency disease (IDD) [thyroxin and
potassium iodide (KI)], liquid crystal display film, iodine-doped
polyvinyl alcohol), photo initiator (iodonium salt), and reaction
intermediates [sodium iodide, iodine chloride, and iodide (I2)]. 
Mitsui Chemicals’ new applications of iodine compounds
included hydrogen iodide as an etching gas for indium tin oxide,
electrochemical regeneration of periodate as a disinfectant, base
polymer for iodophors, and hypervalent iodine compounds for
research purposes for processing new compounds (Kaiho,
2001).
Commercial crude iodine normally has a minimum purity of
99.5% or 99.8%, depending on the supplier.  Impurities are
chiefly water, sulfuric acid, iron, and insoluble materials.  The
U.S. Pharmacopeia (2001, p. 919-921) specifies an iodine
content of not less than 99.8%.  The Committee on Analytical
Reagents of the American Chemical Society allows a maximum
of 0.005% total bromine and chlorine and 0.010% nonvolatile
matter.
Radiopaque agents are drugs used to help diagnose certain
medical problems.  They contain iodine, which absorbs x rays. 
Radiopaque-diagnosed medical problems included biliary tract
disorders, brain disorders, cardiac disease, central nervous
system disorders, cerebrospinal fluid, disk disease,
gastrointestinal (gall bladder) disorders, peritoneal disorders,
splenic and portal vein disorders, urinary track disorders, and
vascular disease.
Iodine is used in tall oil and rosins as a stabilizer.  Tall oil
rosins (TORs) are friable glassy material from light yellow up to
dark brown color from crude turpentine, extraction of ground
timber (wood) by organic solvents, or distillation of crude tall
oil.  TOR is applied in production of synthetic rubber, rubbers,
and plastic and used in skins, varnishes, etc., as a dead flux for
tinning and soldering of metals and also for drawing on a
surface of the hair of string instrument bows.  Crude tall oil
originates as tall oil soap, which is separated from recovered
black liquor in the Kraft pulping process.  The soap is then
acidified to yield crude tall oil.  The tall oil is fractionated to
produce fatty acids, pitch, and rosin.  Fatty acids are sold in
competition with vegetable fatty acids to producers of
detergents, oilfield chemicals, and paints or converted to
derivatives, such as dimer acid.  Rosin is almost always
chemically modified into esters or adducts that are used to make
adhesives, inks, and paper size.  Inks can be divided into several
major categories.  The most popular are the rosin esters, which
are derivatives of tall oil.  Used commonly in gravure and
lithographic inks, rosin esters accounted for 34% of resin
consumption by volume in 1999.  Hydrocarbon resins, widely
used in lithographic inks, accounted for 19% to 20% of
consumption.  Alkyds accounted for 13% but are also used
primarily in lithographic applications, while acrylics, which
accounted for 9%, are used in both flexographic and gravure
printing.  Polyamides accounted for 4% of consumption and are
used exclusively in flexographic inks.  Various other resins
accounted for the remaining 21% of consumption.  Among ink
makers, Sun Chemical Corporation and Flint Ink Corporation
together control 50% of the U.S. market.  Rosin esters for inks

are produced by Hercules Inc., Lawter International Inc.,
Arizona Chemical Co., Akzo Nobel NV, and Avecia Limited
(Boswell, 2001).
Hercules continued the process of divestiture with a definitive
agreement to sell its resins business to Eastman Chemical Co. 
Eastman will acquire Hercules facilities in Jefferson, PA;
Middleburg, Netherlands; Stonehouse, United Kingdom; and
Urapan, Mexico.  Unit operations will be acquired and then
operated under contract with Hercules at shared facilities in
Savannah, GA, and Franklin, VA (Chang, 2001).  International
Specialty Products Inc., which had a 9.92% stake in Hercules as
well as four members on its board, was seeking to increase its
interest to 20% (Sauer, 2001).  Hercules planned to cut 3% of
its workforce by the second quarter of 2002.
Deepwater Chemicals Inc. (a part of Tomen American Inc.)
has been a supplier of iodine derivatives in the United States
since 1931.  The company specializes in a range of inorganic
and organic iodides with custom manufacturing of fine
chemicals to meet specific customer requirements.  Deepwater
supplies iodine derivatives to the agriculture, photography,
catalyst, ink and colorants, sanitizers and disinfectant, industrial
chemical, pharmaceutical intermediates, and water treatment
industries (Deepwater Chemicals Inc., [undated]§).
Perfluoroalky iodides are produced in a variety of chemicals,
such as water- and oil-repellent finishes, surfactant, and surface-
treatment agents.  Another use is in the preparation of a
functionally substituted perfluoro (vinyl ether), which is a key
monomer for perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes for the
industrial chlor-alkali industry.
H&S Chemical Co. Inc. has been a consulting and research
and development company since 1983.  Iodine speciality
chemicals manufactured by the company included more than 20
organic and inorganic compounds.  Included in the list is
hydriodic acid used in the preparation of inorganic iodides,
organic iodides, x-ray contrast intermediates, pharmaceuticals,
disinfectant and sanitizer formulations, and analytical analysis. 
In 1997, the company moved from Cincinnati, OH, 10 miles
south to the enterprise zone of northern Kentucky.  H&S had
three buildings located on 2.3 hectares (5.6 acres) of a 10.1-
hectare (25-acre) site (H&S Chemical Co. Inc., 2001§).
Celanese Chemicals Ltd. consists of the Acetyl Products and
Chemical Intermediates segments of Celanese AG.  Celanese
Chemicals was streamlining jobs at its domestic operations,
including the plants at Clear Lake and Bay City, TX.  About
850 jobs will be eliminated in chemicals, acetate products, and
engineering polymers.  Hercules also planned a 3% cut in the
workforce by June 2002.
In 2001, the American Chemical Society designated an
international historic chemical landmark at the DuPont
Experimental Station in Wilmington, DE, for work by Wallace
H. Carothers that had resulted in the April 1930 discoveries of
both neoprene synthetic rubber and the first commercial super
polymer, Nylon66.  The use of iodine as a catalyst enabled the
commercial production of synthetic rubber and is used to
stabilize iodine (Raber, 2001; Plastics Historical Society,
2001§).
Prices
Prices for iodine are negotiated on long- and short-term
contracts.  The average declared cost, insurance, and freight
(c.i.f.) value for imported crude iodine was $13.90 per
kilogram.  The average declared c.i.f. value for iodine imported
from Chile was $14.01 per kilogram.  The average declared
c.i.f. value for imported crude iodine from Japan was $13.73 per
kilogram.  The average sale price of iodine sold by the DNSC
was $12.27 per kilogram ($5.57 per pound).  Published yearend
U.S. prices for iodine and its primary compounds are listed in
table 3.  Solicitations for NDS iodine are on a quarterly basis
and go out four times a year.  Since 1998, only two companies,
West Agro Chemical Inc. and H&S Chemical Co. Inc., have
purchased stockpile iodine.  Producers believe that the large
quantities of iodine the NDS offers for sale each year result in
depressing the price that producers can ask since they are in
competition with 1 million pounds [454 metric tons (t)] of
excess stockpile iodine each year (fig. 1).
Foreign Trade
The U.S. Government adopted the harmonized commodity
description and coding system as the basis for its export and
import tariff and statistical classification systems.  The system is
intended for multinational use as a basis for classifying
commodities in international trade for tariff, statistical, and
transportation purposes.  It includes resublimed and crude
iodine under the same code and a free duty rate.  Values that
differ significantly could be a result of items being placed in the
wrong category (tables 4, 5).
World Review
The worldwide production of iodine in 2001 was estimated to
be approximately 19,200 t, of which 10,500 t (55%) was from
Chile and 6,100 t (32%) was produced in Japan.  The industrial
demands of iodine are still increasing, and areas of applications
are expanding beyond the established markets, which are as
follows:  various additives (23%), x-ray contrast media (22%),
germicides and disinfectants (17%), catalysts (15%),
pharmaceuticals (9%), and other (14%) (Yamabe, 2000).
The World Health Organization developed guidelines for
iodine prophylaxis following nuclear accidents.  The latest
updated guidelines were in 1999.  The iodine can be ingested as
either KI or potassium iodate (KIO3).  KI is the preferred
alternative since KIO3 has the disadvantage of being a stronger
intestinal irritant.  There is no decisive difference in shelf life
between KIO3 and KI.  If storage conditions are adequate, then
the expected shelf life of the tablets is at least 5 years.  After 5
years, the iodine content may be checked and the shelf life
extended.  Adults and children 12 and over should receive 130-
mg doses of KI, children 3-12 should receive 65 mg KI, and
infants 1 month to 3 years old should receive 32 mg KI (World
Health Organization, 1999§).
Chile.—Atacama Minerals Corp. announced on November 30
that its operating partner, ACF Minera S.A., reached production
rates of 2 metric tons per day (t/d) of iodine at the Aquas
Blancas project in northern Chile to satisfy phase I of the
project.  The melting and prilling facility was brought online
making Aquas Blancas the newest fully integrated Chilean
iodine operation.  In phase II, ACF will be required to construct
mechanical leaching facilities to maximize recovery of all
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK—2001

commercial products at the mine.  The project is located 100 km
from the port of Antofagasta.  Current proven/probable reserves
are 44 million metric tons (Mt), grading 412 parts per million
(ppm) iodine, 22% sodium sulphate, and 2.87 t nitrates.  Full
operation of Aquas Blancas will produce 1,200 t/yr of iodine,
300,000 t/yr of sodium sulfate, and 100,000 t/yr of nitrate
(Clark, 2001§).
Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM) was the
largest producer of iodine.  All production is from caliche ore. 
The geologic origin of the caliche ore is not clear, but it is
thought to be of sedimentary origin.  There is 0.5 to 2.5 meters
of overburden above the ore.  Iodine concentrations vary among
mines, but as a reference, SQM extracted 17 Mt of ore in 1999
in Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia with an average of 422
ppm iodine.  Ore is crushed to one-half inch size and transferred
to a leaching plant in vats where nitrate, iodine, and sulfate are
extracted.  At the Pampa Blanca mine, located in the Sierra
Gorda area, the ore is leached in piles to obtain solutions of
iodine, which are transported to solar evaporation ponds.  SQM
produced an intermediate iodine at Pedro de Valdivia, Maria
Elena, Pampa Blanca, and Nueva Victoria facilities.  The iodine
is treated at the Pedro de Valdivia and Nueva Victoria plants to
obtain refined iodine that is smelted, prilled, and packed for
shipping.  SQM has a 50% ownership in AJAY-SQM Group
(Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, [undated]§).  AJAY-
SQM Group is the largest producer of iodine basic inorganic
and organic derivatives, accounting for around 25% of world
production (Martinez, Eduardo, SQM North America Corp.,
written commun., October 22, 2002).
SQM agreed to buy the nonmetalic mining assets of the
Inverraz Group for $140 million.  Inverraz’s main assets were a
nitrate and iodine mine called Compania de Salitre y Yodo de
Chile (Cosayach).  The negotiations reportedly ended after 7
months of negotiations when, on October 5, 2001, SQM
announced that the differences that existed among the two
parties prevented a successful agreement (Fertilizer Markets,
2001).  On October 26, 2001, Potash Corporation of
Saskatchewan Inc. (PCS) acquired approximately 33.5% of
SQM’s series “A” shares, which represented 18.2% of  SQM’s
total property.  The shares were sold by institutional investors
that included Chilean Pension Fund Administrators.  PCS made
additional purchases of shares that represented 20.4% of SQM’s
total property.  PCS, which operated the Yumbes Mine and
facilities through its subsidiary PCS Yumbes, confirmed the
purchase in a press release (Chile Chemicals, 2001b§).  PCS is
the world’s largest producer of potassium chloride and it is
integrated in the production and commercialization of various
phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers.
DSM Minera is a 100% owned subsidiary of the DSM Fine
Chemicals business of DSM Group of the Netherlands.  DSM
Minera submitted an environmental impact statement to the
Chilean Region I Commission on the Environment for the
construction of a new iodine production plant in Pozo Almonte. 
The new plant will produce iodine derivatives, such as KI and
sodium iodide.  These derivatives will represent 60% of DSM’s
total production.  The remaining 40% will be exported as pure
iodine and produced in the company’s Iris-Granja plant in Pozo
Almonte.  The iodine derivatives will be transported to Arica
and Iquique for export.  The plant’s construction will require an
investment of $4 million.  Until 1996, DSM Minera owned only
30% of the Iris-Granja plant.  The remaining 70% was held by
the ACF Minera.  In 1997, DSM purchased 70% of ACF
Minera, thereby taking control of the plant (Chile Chemicals,
2001a§).
Europe.—An outbreak of foot and mouth disease led to an
abnormally high demand for iodine.  Antec International Ltd. is
the leading supplier for livestock disinfectants, which include
the iodine-based product Virudine™ (Industrial Minerals,
2001).
India.—The duty on iodine was reduced to 10% from 25%. 
The chemical industry has become a major producer and
exporter of chemicals in the world partly because of scaling
down the import duty on chemicals widely used in the industry
(Ministry of Finance of India, 1997§).
Indonesia.—P.T. Lamindo Ekaperdana reported brines
containing 100 ppm of iodine.  The company planned to build a
250 t/yr iodine plant (Tampi Mariko, P.T. Lamindo Ekaperdana,
written commun., 2000).
Japan.—Japan was the world’s second largest producer of
iodine (table 6).  Iodine was manufactured in Chiba, Miyazaki,
and Niigata Prefectures; Chiba Prefecture accounted for about
90% of all production in Japan.  The following 8 companies
operated 11 plants in Japan:  Ise Chemical Co., Ltd., 2 plants in
Chiba Prefecture and 1 in Miyazaki Prefecture, 300 metric tons
per month (t/mo); Kanto Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd.
(KNG), Chiba Prefecture, 100 t/mo; Godo Shigen Sangyo Co.,
Ltd., Chiba Prefecture, 200 t/mo; Japan Energy Development
Co., Ltd., Niigata Prefecture, 30 t/mo; Teikoku Oil Co. Ltd.,
Chiba Prefecture, 50 t/mo; Toho Earthtech, Inc., Niigata
Prefecture, 60 t/mo; Nippoh Chemicals Co., Ltd., Chiba
Prefecture, 60 t/mo; and Nihon Tennen Gas Co., Ltd., 2 plants
in Chiba Prefecture, 100 t/mo.
Sumitomo Chemical Co. and Mitsui announced a $1.6 billion
merger targeted for 2003.  This would create the largest
chemical company in Asia and the fifth largest in the world. 
Mitsui is a producer of iodine in the United States.  Mitsui and
KNG have a joint venture (JI Chemicals Inc.) to develop iodine
derivative products (Kanto Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd.,
[undated]).
KNG was established in 1931 and uses the ion-exchange resin
and the blowing-out methods to produce iodine.  In the ion-
exchange resin method, sand and other impurities are removed
by precipitation or filtration.  The iodine is then separated from
the brine by means of an oxidizing agent and collected by
adsorption on the ion-exchange resin.  The iodine is separated
from the resin by elution, crystallized, and refined.  The elution
of the resin produces a concentrated iodine solution.
The blowing-out method makes use of the ease with which
iodine evaporates and is suitable for use with high-temperature
brine.  After removal of sand and other impurities by
precipitation and separation of the iodine using an oxidizing
agent, the brine is exposed to air.  The iodine evaporates and is
then absorbed, crystallized, and refined.  The brines average
110 ppm, and the iodine produced is 99.7% pure.  International
Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 certification was granted in
1995 (Kanto Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd., [undated]).
Nihon was established in 1940, and iodine production began
in 1944.  In 1969, a new plant was built in Yokoshiba-machi,
and in 1973 and 1988, new plants were built in Chiba
Prefecture.  Equipment for iodine adsorption changed to sloping
IODINE—2001
38.5
fluidized bed (SFB) in June 1993.  The plants gained ISO 9002
certification in 1996.  Iodine is produced by the following two
processes:  extraction by resins (discussed before) and the SFB
developed to pass brine through the adsorption tower without
filtration.  The elution of the resin produces a concentrated
iodine solution.  Iodine is crystallized by oxidizers, separated,
and refined into a flaked product (Nihon Tennen Gas Co., Ltd.,
[undated]).
The Forum on Iodine Utilization (FIU), which was created in
June 1998 with the cooperation of industrial, governmental, and
academic circles, reached 300 members in 1999.  The FIU
actively promotes the development of the iodine industry by a
variety of symposiums on basic research and applications.  The
fourth FIU symposium was held at Chiba University in 2001.  It
included 7 talks and 32 poster sessions (Forum on Iodine
Utilization, 2001).
IDD occurs in areas where iodine content of foods is very
low.  Developed countries have recognized the problem and
require iodized salt for consumption.  A common agenda was
established between Japan and the United States in 1996 to
promote cooperation on IDD problems.  The Japan International
Cooperation Agency and the government of Chiba Prefecture
started the Assistance for Mongolia Program in 1997 (Irie,
2000).
Russia.—Iodine content ranges between 30 milligrams per
liter (mg/l) and 90 mg/l in 20 oilfields of Northern Sakhalin. 
The highest grade field is the Odoptu field where recovery of
the iodine content could produce 30 t/d of iodine (Elena
Sabirova, American Business Center, written commun., March
19, 2001).
A deposit was discovered in Tyumen Oblast, 30 km from the
city of Tobolsk.  The average content of iodine in the brine is 26
mg/l.  Production of 300 t/yr to 500 t/yr for 25 years was
estimated (Vladimir Spivak, written commun., August 13,
2002).
A foreign investment project was offered at the Troitsk Iodine
Plant.  An investment of $15.5 million was sought to reconstruct
and increase production capacity of iodine and iodine
derivatives at the plant (Foreign Investment Promotion Center,
[undated]§).
On October 30, the new Land Code of Russia came into
force; it represented a significant reform owing to sanction and
encouragement given to the creation of private ownership rights
to land, including ownership rights to foreigners.  The full
provisions of the Land Code apply only to certain
nonagricultural land that constitutes approximately 2% of
Russia’s land surface (Moore, 2002).
Turkmenistan.—Iodine is produced in Turkmenistan by State
Corporation TurkmenDokunKhimiya at three wholly state-
owned iodine plants—the Balkanabad Chemical Plant, the
Boyadag State Chemical Plant, and the Hazar State Chemical
Plant.  The combined iodine nameplate capacity of these plants
is about 600 t/yr.  In November 2001, TurkmenDokunKhimiya
announced a tender for the construction of five new plants with
a granulated iodine production capacity of 100 t/yr each or 500
t/yr in total capacity.
The Balkanabad Chemical Plant, formerly the Nebitdagsky
Iodine Plant, was commissioned in 1964 and is located at
Vyshka in Balkan Velayat.  The plant has a nameplate capacity
of 255 t/yr of 99% pure iodine but was operating at production
of between 5 t/mo and 6 t/mo or 60 t/yr to 72 t/yr.  The plant
uses the absorption method to extract iodine from brines
associated with the Nebit-Dag-Monzhuklinskoe deposit.  The
brines have an iodine content of between 30 mg/l and 35 mg/l. 
The plant can also produce iodine derivatives, such as
potassium iodide and iodoform.
The Boyadag State Chemical Plant, located near the town of
Kumgag in the Balkan Velayat, was opened in 1999.  The plant
is the smallest of the three state owned plants with an estimated
nameplate capacity of 100 t/yr.  In 2001, the monthly iodine
production was between 4 t/mo and 5 t/mo.  The plant produced
iodine of 97% to 99% purity and the product is transported to
the Hazar plant for processing to 99.5% iodine.
The Hazar State Chemical Plant, formerly known as the
Chelekensky Chemical Plant, is located in Balkan Velayat,
north of Cheleken City.  The plant processes brines associated
with the Cheleken deposit that contain between 20 mg/l and 30
mg/l of iodine.  The Hazar plant was originally commissioned in
the 1930s with an iodine nameplate capacity of 240 t/yr using
the absorption method.  In the 1980s, a further 110 t/yr of
capacity was added raising the current capacity to 350 t/yr.  In
2001, production of the plant was between 7 t/mo and 8 t/mo of
iodine of 99.5% purity and 5 t/mo of 99% purity.
The Senagatsu joint venture was established in 1998 between
Guneykaya Group of Turkey (49%) and the Turkmen Ministry
of Water and Minerals (51%).  Following the reorganization of
the Ministry of Water and Minerals in 1999 to 2000, its share
was transferred to the municipality of Ashgabat City.  Iodine is
produced, processed, and packaged at two facilities at
Seyitkerdiri and Kizylarvat in the Balkan district close to iodine
rich brines extracted from the Boyadag deposit.  The brines
contain between 314 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) and
388 mg/m3 iodine.  The company began production in 1999
with a nameplate capacity of 4,000 t/yr.  Three more plants are
expected to be completed in 2003.  Resublimed iodine produced
is 99.5% pure iodine.
Guneykaya Group reported that the main foreign market for
its share of production was Russia, where it was used in
catalysts and pharmaceuticals.  Golden Bridhe of Dubai, United
Arab Emirates, is a major exporter of iodine from
Turkmenistan.  Golden Bridhe signed a contract with
TurkmenDokunKhimiya to export 200 t of production in 2002. 
The company planned to export a total of 300 t of iodine from
Turkmenistan during the same year (Roskill Information
Services Ltd., 2002, p. 77-80; table 6).
Current Research and Technology
SQM published a book entitled “IODINE, High Performance
Chemistry” with the purpose of providing a basic reference for
people that may be interested in iodine chemistry (Sociedad
Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, 2001).  Researchers,
consumers, or others interested in a deeper understanding of this
element would find this book a useful reference.  The purpose
of the book is to stimulate interest in new and existing
applications for iodine.  SQM stated that an award is planned in
association with an international chemists’ association to be
given to theoretical or practical research in iodine chemistry
(Eduardo Martinez, SQM North America Corp., written
commun., October 7, 2002).
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK—2001

The USGS planned to publish the first national survey of
drugs and personal care products in streams in 2002.  Possibly
in 2002, the USGS also planned to publish measurements from
80 groundwater sources.  For these analyses, 95 substances are
being measured from thousands of possible chemicals.  In a
program begun in 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency
started working closely with the USGS to do research to assess
possible risks from pharmaceuticals and personal care products
that end up in the environment.  Drugs ingested are excreted in
the urine or feces as the same drug or metabolized into bioactive
substances that can be converted back to the original drug in
sewage treatment plants.  Another direct and avoidable source
of drugs in water supplies and sediments are antibiotics given to
livestock in their feed.  During the past decade, chemists began
measuring levels in German water supplies and have found
levels to be high.  For example, the x-ray contrast media
iopamidol was measured at 15 parts per billion (ppb) in sewage
treatment plant effluent.  In German streams, the levels of drugs
generally are less than 1 ppb, but in groundwater, the levels of
some drugs were higher.  There is presently a wide range of
drinking water treatment designs.  A combination of activated
carbon and ozone treatment or nanofiltration provide the highest
level of removal of contaminants (Hileman, 2001).
Nonoriented nylon 6, which was doped with iodine in an I2-
KI solution, was aged in environments with different relative
humidities.  A relative increase in mass of the complex was
measured in the 97% relative humidity environments at room
temperature and 1 or 2 months aging (Kawaguchi, 2001).
Researchers at The Pennsylvania State University studied the
synthesis of anti-inflammatory and antileukemic products using
aryl(alkynyl)iodonium salts in new chemical transformations for
organic synthesis.  An alkaloid, halichlorine, isolated from the
sponge Halichondria okadai Kodata holds promise for
designing anti-inflammatory agents based on the halichlorine
structure.  Using alkynyliodonium salt chemistry, a synthesis
plan is being researched.  In separate work, pareitropone, a
member of the tropoloisoquinoline alkaloid family of plant
metabolites, demonstrates strong antileukemic activity. 
Research to develop a synthetic pareitropone is underway. 
These synthesis projects are possible because of the unique
electrophilic properties conferred by the hypervalent iodine
atom as well as the potent and varied reactivity of the derived
alkylidenecarbenes.  Application of this chemistry leads to
stereochemically and functionally complex materials that can
form natural product structures (Feldman and others, 2001).
Alan J. Heeger, Alan G. Macdiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa
received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 for the discovery
and development of conductive polymers.  Hideki Shirakawa, a
retired professor from the University of Tsukuba, Japan,
developed the field of electrically conductive polymers.  Dr. K.
Akagi, a former coworker of Dr. Shirakawa, explained the
process of producing such compounds with iodine in an
electrically conducting polymer to achieve electrical
conductivity as comparable with that of producing those with
copper and silver.  Dr. Akagi reviewed advances in conducting
polymers by focusing on polyacetylene, liquid crystalline
polyacetylene derivatives, and helical polyacetylene with a
screw-shaped structure (Akagi, 2001).
Iodine derivatives synthesized as effective antibacterial and
antifungal agents are designed to release iodine slowly to
function as biocides.  Iodine slow release agents in combination
with iodine and such polymers as polyvinlylpyrroliodone-iodine
complex (PVP-I) have a shorter release time.  An alternative of
PVP-I is cyclodextrin-iodine inclusion complex (CDI) formed
from cyclodextrin and iodine.  CDI has a slow release rate and
lasting biocide effects.  A water soluble CDI can be prepared by
using methylated cyclodextrin (Hagiwara, 2001).
Titanium-tetrahalide-promoted reactions are valuable tools in
organic synthesis.  Differences in the reactivities of tetrahalides
enabled distinct reaction pathways through selection of an
appropriate tetrahalide derivative to promote the reaction. 
Researchers at Mie University in Tsu-shi, Mie Prefecture,
Japan, studied titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) as a reagent for the
reductive formation of carbonyl compounds and subsequent
reactions with carbonyl compounds.  The use of TiI4, a
commercially available and inexpensive chemical, offers a
convenient and practical method for selective reactions of
organic compounds (Shimizu and Hayakawa, 2001).
Researchers at Tokai University started a 5-year project to
develop a practical chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) system
for commercial uses.  Because of its high-power capability,
COIL has been studied as an antimissile laser in the United
States.  As an industrial laser, COIL has unique characteristics,
as follows:  the wavelength is ideal for optical fiber delivery,
and an external electric power supply is not required because it
is a chemical laser.  This makes the laser system attractive for
such applications as nuclear reactor decommissioning,
construction, civil engineering, and other field applications
where a high-power electrical supply is difficult to secure (Endo
and others, 2001).
Researches at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) studied trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) as a
potential replacement for halon 1301 in aircraft fire suppression
systems.  Before CF3I can be considered as a potential drop-in
replacement, several operational and technical issues must be
addressed or re-examined.  Preliminary results were
encouraging, but more experiments are required to delineate the
dispersion of cold and room temperature CF3I in air.  Additional
experiments in the NIST cold environmental chamber are
required (Yang, Myden, and Manzello, 2001§).
Researchers at F-Tech Inc. (Japan) developed a catalytic
system to produce CF3I that was a practical and cost-effective
method for large-scale manufacture.  CF3I was being studied as
a replacement for halon 1301 and halon 1211 as a fire
extinguishing agent (Tokoyoda and others, 2001).
Researchers at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute
conducted research and development on a themochemical
process to produce hydrogen as part of a program to utilize heat
from high-temperature gas-cooled reactors using iodine and
sulfur compounds (Jubo and Nakajima, 2001).
Researchers at Misti Chemicals Inc. reported the results of
dry etching on indium-tin-oxide film used in electrodes for
liquid crystal displays, using hydrogen iodide (HI) gas by
inductive coupling plasma.  Compared with hydrogen chloride
(HCl), the HI gas had a taper angle of 90o C and no photo resist
damage.  The etching speed of HI was also faster than HCl
(Yanagawa, Odazawa, and Sadamoto, 2001).
Researchers at Chiba Institute of Technology studied the
tribiological properties of anodic oxide coating of aluminum
impregnated with an iodine compounds.  The impregnation of
IODINE—2001
38.7
the iodine compounds in the micropores of anodic oxide coating
lowered the coefficient of dynamic friction and wear loss
(Takaya and others, 2001).
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology devised
a coating, hexyl-PVP, that can kill 99% of common disease-
causing organisms.  PVP is the acronym for
polyvinylpyrriodone.  The polymer kills bacteria by a powerful
chemical-electrical action, a permanent positive charge that
destroys bacteria cell walls and membranes.  The antibacterial
coating could be incorporated during manufacture so that the
surface of many products could be permanently sterile
(Midfully.org, 2001§).
PVP polymers (PVPP) are dye-receptive agents, binders,
complexing agents, detoxicants, film formers, protective
colloidals, stabilizers, and suspending agents.  The polymers are
available in several viscosity grades, ranging from very low to
very high molecular weight, giving this family of products great
flexibility across a wide range of industries (International
Specialty Products Corp., 1999§).
International Specialty Products Corp. (ISP) offers a tablet
disintegrator for nonpharmaceutical products that is based on
PVPP technology similar to that used by pharmaceutical tablet
formulators.  The PVPP swells on contact with water, causing
rapid tablet breakup and helping soap to quickly dissolve in the
wash.  ISP is planning a series of blends of PVPP with other
disintegratable materials to offer a range of cost and
performance options (McCoy, 2000).
Glass slides treated with hexyl-PVP killed 94% to 99% of the
staphylococcus organisms.  This special coating could be
applied to toys, telephones, door knobs, and even surgical
equipment to kill most of the common bacteria that cause
infection (Mercy Health Partners, 2001§).
Outlook
During the past decade, iodine production capacity in Chile
and the United States has doubled, thus ensuring an adequate
future world supply.  Overall consumption in traditional uses is
projected to grow by as much as 2% per year.  Uses for iodine
in specialty chemicals have remained stable.
Recent developments in digital imaging can produce
electronic prints and overhead transparencies without the need
for wet processing.  Using a digital camera or scanning the film
and converting to digital tapes, the images are produced and
stored on disks, hard drives, and tapes.  Digital imaging is used
for recording most sporting events, game shows, and some
situation comedies for television broadcast.  From 75% to 85%
of all televised programs seen during prime time are recorded
on 35-millimeter (mm) motion picture film and then transferred
to video tape or laser disc for display.  Furthermore, the
majority of feature films for movie theater presentations are shot
and printed on film because of better image quality.  A frame of
35-mm color negative film contains about 6.6 million pixels,
about 15 times that of the best high-definition television system
and 4 times that of the digital systems now in development. 
Most popular home video rentals have been box office movie
hits that were filmed and then transferred to video.  In the next
decade, future uses of iodine in films and processing could be
limited to specialty imaging as digital imagery technology
improves and the cost of equipment becomes more affordable.
There are three major markets for traditional conductive
polymers—fuel systems, business machines, and wafer and chip
handling.  The Freedonia Group, Cleveland, OH, projected the
domestic conductive polymer market to grow at 6% per year
and to reach $1.5 billion in 2002 from a current market of $950
million in 2001.  Conductive polymers have lower weight, cost,
and design advantages over metals.
New uses of fluoroiodocarbon as halogen replacements may
cause increased demand for iodine for fire suppression.  More
tests need to be completed on the iodated fluorocarbons before
they are acceptable, but preliminary tests are promising. 
Supplemental programs designed to alleviate IDD in China and
India are consuming large amounts of iodine.  X-ray contrast
media, which contain as much as 60% iodine, will continue to
grow between 4% and 5% per year.  In Chile and Mexico,
individual water purification units that use iodine are a new
application of a historical purification process.  Purification
applications could become significant consumers of iodine.
