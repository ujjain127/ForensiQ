General
Directions
Your school has agreed to participate in TIMSS
2003, a large international study of student
learning in mathematics and science in more than
50 countries around the world. Sponsored by the
International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement (IEA), TIMSS (for Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study)
is measuring trends in student achievement and
studying differences in national education systems
in order to help improve the teaching and learning
of mathematics and science worldwide.
As part of the study, students in a nationwide
sample of eighth-grade classes in the United
States will complete the TIMSS mathematics and
science tests. This questionnaire is addressed to
teachers who teach mathematics to these
students, and seeks information about teachers’
academic and professional backgrounds,
instructional practices, and attitudes toward
teaching mathematics. As a teacher of
mathematics to students in one of these sampled
classes, your responses to these questions are
very important in helping to describe mathematics
education in the United States.
Some of the questions in this questionnaire refer
specifically to students in the “TIMSS class.” This
is the class that is identified on the cover of this
questionnaire and that will be tested as part of
TIMSS 2003 in your school. It is important that
you answer each question carefully so that the
information that you provide reflects your
situation as accurately as possible.
Please identify a time and place where you will be
able to complete this questionnaire without being
interrupted.  Filling out the questionnaire should
require no more than 45 minutes.  To make it as
easy as possible for you to respond, most
questions may be answered simply by checking or
filling the appropriate circle.
Once you have completed the questionnaire, place
it in the return envelope provided and return it to
the school coordinator.
Thank you very much for the time and effort you
have put into responding to this questionnaire.
