Waste Reduction Activities for Hospitals
Waste prevention means eliminating waste before it is created. It's a proven cost-effective approach that helps
both your bottom line and the environment. Combined with a comprehensive recycling effort, hospitals can
significantly reduce their waste. All activities on this fact sheet have been implemented by some hospital in the
United States or have been provided by a medical professional.
Waste, here today and tomorrow
Californians generate 45 million tons of waste each
year. That's equivalent to eight pounds per person per
day! Meanwhile, landfills are filling up as it becomes
more costly and difficult to site new ones.
To address this problem, in 1990 the California
legislature mandated that local jurisdictions reduce
their solid waste generation by 25 percent in 1995 and
50 percent in the year 2000. All of us, at home and
work, have a responsibility to conserve resources for
future generations.
Fortunately, many waste prevention practices save
money. Waste reduction, the combination of waste
prevention and recycling efforts, makes good
business sense.
Resource efficiency begins by understanding what
is purchased, how goods are used, and what is
discarded, and then is put to use by finding ways to
eliminate, reduce, reuse, and recycle materials.
Strategies for reducing waste
Contrary to popular belief, nonhazardous medical
waste makes up nearly 3/4 of the waste generated
in a hospital and should not be overlooked.
A good strategy is to target the largest components
of the waste stream and do the easy waste reduction
steps first. In column 2 is a chart showing the solid
waste composition in hospitals in the City of Los
Angeles. Although waste varies, in most hospitals the
largest components of the waste stream are paper
(especially cardboard, mixed paper, newspapers, and
high-grade paper), plastics (especially film plastic),
food waste, and disposable linens (a combination of
paper and other materials). Yard trimmings may be a
much higher percent of your waste stream if your
hospital has a large landscaped area. See Appendix A
for a more detailed listing of these materials.
Along with preventing waste and recycling, it is
important to purchase products made from recycled
materials. This makes recycling successful by
stimulating demand for recycled materials.
Finally, consider rewarding employees for their
successful waste reduction ideas. Some hospitals
reward employees with cash bonuses and recognition.
Percent Solid Waste Composition (by Weight) in
Hospitals*
Based on composition of waste in nine Los Angeles
city hospitals (1990)
* Finding waste reduction ideas
Following are ideas to help you identify waste
reduction opportunities at your hospital. By setting up
a solid waste management program you can turn ideas
into action. (See Appendix B for guidebooks on how
to set up your own solid waste management program.)
Custodial services
§ 
Renegotiate contracts with haulers of "red bag" or
regulated medical waste to provide clean and
reusable containers.
 The NewYork City Department of Sanitation
estimates that a l,000-bed hospital switching from
disposable to reusable containers for sharp
medical instruments would achieve:
 Cost savings per year: $175,000
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 34,000
§ 
Eliminate plastic trash bag liners in administrative
areas.
http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/BizWaste/FactSheets/Hospital.htm
04/26/02
 The New York City Department of Sanitation
estimates that a l,000-bed hospital making this
change would achieve:
 Cost savings per year: $20,000
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 14,000
§ 
Buy most cleaning substances in 55-gallon drums
that are refilled by the supplier.
§ 
Use concentrated cleaning solutions that staff can
mix as needed.
§ 
Use washable mop heads instead of disposable
ones.
 Purchasing
§ 
Buy in bulk whenever possible; it saves
packaging.
 Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital (341 beds) in
Portland, Oregon switched from buying juice in
32-oz glass containers to 60-oz plastic containers
that the hospital recycles.
 Cost savings per year: $125
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 2,500
§ 
Select or ask vendors to follow packaging
preference criteria:
 No packaging or minimal packaging.
 Consumable, returnable, refillable, reusable
packaging.
 Recyclable packaging/recycled material in
packaging.
§ 
Improve ordering practices so perishable products
don't become outdated and unusable.
§ 
Cut down on multiple subscriptions of medical
publications by asking staff to share journals and
magazines.
§ 
Reuse packaging.
 Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region receives
more than 24,000 glasses and contact lens boxes
annually. The region started reusing 2,000 of these
boxes to mail eyeglasses instead of buying new
boxes. Remaining boxes are available for
pharmacy mailings.
 Patient-care supplies
§ 
Determine if cloth towels can be used and later
sold for rags.
§ 
Replace paper towels with air dryers.
 The New York City Department of Sanitation
estimates that a l,000-bed hospital replacing paper
towels with air dryers would achieve:
 Cost savings per year: $45,000
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 200,000
§ 
Use cloth diapers.
 Kaiser Permanente's Northwest Region switched
from disposable to cloth diapers.  Any hospital
making this change needs to follow procedures for
infection control and skin care. Kaiser found there
was no change in costs or savings—it was a cost-
neutral change:
 There was no adverse effect on patient or staff
safety.
 It decreased the amount of solid waste going
to landfills.
§ 
Use worn diapers as cleaning rags.
§ 
Provide decubitus-care mattresses instead of
foam "egg-carton" mattresses.
 Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland,
Oregon (341-bed facility) purchased several
hundred permanent waterproof mattresses to
replace about 96 percent of disposable egg crate
foam mattresses (it is still necessary to use foam
mattresses in some situations). The initial
purchase was significant, but the decision paid for
itself in just one year.
 Savings in purchasing costs per year: $80,710
 Disposal savings per year: $817
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 16,350
§ 
Eliminate duplicate admission kits.
 Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland,
Oregon (341-bed facility) stopped handing out
starter admission kits to maternity patients
because they received a special kit from the
maternity department.
 Net savings per year: $3,547
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 2,704
§ 
Replace disposable admissions kits (water
pitchers, glasses, and bedpans) with reusables in
patient rooms.
 Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan
(529-bed facility) switched to autoclavable plastic
bedpans.
 Savings in purchasing costs per year: $1,320
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 960
http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/BizWaste/FactSheets/Hospital.htm
04/26/02
§ 
Use washable linens, bed pads, underpads, gowns,
and emesis basins.
 Butterworth Hospital purchased 5,000 reusable
underpads to replace 30,000 disposable pads each
month.
 Savings in purchasing costs per year: $15,000
 Savings in disposal costs per year: $877
§ 
Purchase reusable pillows.
§ 
Convert blankets, mattress pads, and quilts into
potholders (done by volunteers).
§ 
Set up system where nursing staff evaluates
personal care items such as aspirin packets,
tissues, shampoo, baby wipes and diapers for
reuse (following infection control guidelines)
instead of automatically disposing of them.
 Based on a pilot study of this approach,
Butterworth Hospital estimates that implementing
this type of system throughout the hospital will
save about $30,000 annually.
 Medical/surgical supplies
§ 
Eliminate unused items from custom surgical
packs (once a pack is opened, unused items are
discarded).
 Surgery and purchasing staff from five Legacy
Hospitals in the Portland area formed several
committees to review the contents of its custom
packs. They identified items that are not used
regularly enough to justify inclusion in the various
packs.
 Net savings per year: $30,000+
 Total waste prevention in pounds per year:
11,000
§ 
Consider switching from disposable to reusable
medical instruments (e.g., stainless steel trays,
laparoscopic instruments).
§ 
Contact the manufacturer when one item in a
surgical tray is causing the whole pack to outdate
early (e.g., tetracaine in a spinal tray).
§ 
Evaluate changing to a nontoxic x-ray developer.
§ 
Purchase washable surgical and isolation gowns
and sterilization trays.
 Mercy Healthcare of Sacramento now purchases
reusable liquid-proof surgical gowns and towels at
six facilities:
 Cost savings per year: $60,000
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 50,000
§ 
Mend gown ties so they last longer.
§ 
Convert surgical drapes into biopsy cloths.
§ 
Sanitize and reuse plastic fracture pans.
§ 
Sanitize and reuse graduated measuring
containers.
§ 
Donate clean, unused operating room (OR)
supplies for reuse overseas.
 Cafeterias
§ 
Use washable plates, eating utensils, glasses, and
cups for cafeteria and patient service.
 The New York City Department of Sanitation
estimates that a l,000-bed hospital switching from
disposable to reusable food service items would
achieve:
 Cost savings per year: $500,000
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 400,000
§ 
Sell reusable mugs with no-spill lids, then offer
discounts to anyone using their own mug.
§ 
Start up a "think before you use" campaign to
decrease use of disposable items: napkins,
condiments, etc.
§ 
Switch to a bulk milk dispenser for patients
instead of individual milk cartons.
§ 
Compost kitchen and food waste.
 The New York City Department of Sanitation is
doing a pilot study of separate collection of
compostable food-service waste. Check with your
local government recycling coordinator to see if
this service is offered in your community.
 Offices
§ 
Assess need for photocopies and print only what
is needed.
 The Legacy Visiting Nurse Association in
Portland, Oregon analyzed the process and flow
of paper.  Seven copies of each admitting record
were made and distributed.  They asked
employees and customers how copies were used.
Typically, fewer than 50 percent of copies were
needed.  Now copies are printed as needed and
pending files are available on a computer.
 Net cost savings per year: $127,764
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 1,200
§ 
Customize the distribution of reports
(e.g., daily census).
http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/BizWaste/FactSheets/Hospital.htm
04/26/02
 The Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland,
Oregon asked department managers which
portions of reports they needed in hard copy and
whether they would need hard copies once on-line
viewing on a computer was available. Twenty-
three percent responded that they did not need
hard copies now, and 55 percent responded they
would not need hard copies once on-line viewing
became available.
 Net savings per year: $9,222
 Waste prevention in pounds per year: 3,504
§ 
Increase double-sided copying in central copy
areas.
§ 
Keep records on microfiche or make double-sided
copies for paper documents.
§ 
Consolidate multiple forms and reduce extra
copies.
§ 
Use fax machines that take plain paper so faxes
do not need to be copied again.
§ 
Keep report and memo writing to a minimum and
limit distribution.
§ 
Reuse paper only used on one side.
§ 
Purchase recycled paper and print stationary,
business cards, etc. on recycled paper.
Landscaping
§ 
Use mulching mowers and leave grass clippings
on the lawn so they can decompose naturally
(grasscycling).
 Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region
(Clackamas, Oregon) replaced one-third of its
mowing equipment to mulching mowers (three
riding models and eight walk-behind models).
These mowers are currently used to maintain 38
acres of lawn. Plans call for replacing all mowers
over a two-year period.
 Labor savings by eliminating bagging:
28 percent
 Reduction in fertilizer: 33 percent
 Eliminates 15,200 bags or 380,000 pounds of
grass clippings each year. (One acre of
grass generates about 400 25-pound bags of
clippings yearly. This estimate varies with
location and grass type.)
§ 
Landscape using plants that grow slowly or have
enough space so they do not need to be constantly
trimmed.
 Hospital-wide reuse
 Set up a reuse area where employees and local
schools can pick up used, yet still useful, items such as
old binders, folders, paper clips, cassette tapes, plastic
containers, etc. For information on how you can
participate in a statewide materials exchange network,
contact the California Materials Exchange (CalMAX)
at (916) 341-6603. CalMAX issues a free quarterly
catalog that lists materials wanted and available,
which is also on the Internet at
www.ciwmb.ca.gov/CalMAX/.
 Recycle waste that can't be prevented
 In 1993, three Portland hospitals recycled over 1
million pounds of materials, including office paper
products, cardboard, plastic resins, glass, metal, and
foam. This saved $45,000 in avoided disposal costs.
§ 
Set up a collection system, arrange to have items
picked up for recycling, and educate staff. The
following items are recycled in other hospitals:
 Corrugated cardboard*
 White office paper
 Newspapers
 Mixed paper*
 Beverage containers (aluminum cans, glass
bottles)
 Steel cans (used by food service)
 Plastics (Work with suppliers so goods are
made from or packaged with the same plastic
resin, so they are easier to recycle.)
 * Stan Strickland from Kaiser Permanente
Northern California Region analyzed the region’s
recycling options and found that for starting up its
recycling program it was best to focus on paper
and cardboard. The savings in avoided disposal
costs for these bulky items make this a cost-
effective approach.
§ 
If you must use disposables, select ones that can
be recycled.
 The Legacy Health System in Portland, Oregon
switched from paper/plastic blend disposable
coffee cups to an all-plastic recyclable cup.
Employees were also encouraged to bring their
own mugs to the cafeteria for a discount.
 Savings in purchasing costs per year: $24,000
 Savings in disposal costs per year: $1,417
 Waste reduction in pounds per year: 28,333
