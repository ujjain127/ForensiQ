NIDA Smoke-Free Meetings Policy
Smoke-Free Jurisdictions List January 2007
Page 1 of 4
In September 2006, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) announced a new 
smoke-free meeting policy requiring that all meetings and conferences organized or
primarily sponsoredby NIDA be held in a state, county, city, or town that has adopted a
comprehensive smoke-free policy.
For purposes of meeting planning,NIDA considers a jurisdiction (state, city, town, or
county) smoke free if it provides employees and the general public complete or near
complete protection from secondhand smoke in enclosed workplaces, including
restaurants.
