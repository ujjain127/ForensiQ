Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program (CLDAP).
B
Purpose
This notice provides State and County Offices with:
&
general payment provisions
&
instructions for ensuring that payment limitation allocations are set properly for
multi-county producers
&
information and instructions for issuing additional payments to California
producers with eligible citrus losses

General Payment Provisions
A
Eligible
Producers and
Crops
Payments to California producers with citrus losses is not a new program.  Rather,
it is an additional payment to specific producers who:
&
suffered a loss on their 1999 citrus crop because of weather occurring in
December 1998
&
subsequently filed CCC-547 under the 1999 CDP program.
Producers are eligible to receive the California Citrus payment if all of the
following apply.
&
Physical location of the 1999 crop loss was in California
&
Producer timely filed CCC-547 for a crop loss on Valencia Oranges.
Note: CCC-547’s must have been filed by the February 25, 2000, program
signup deadline.  County Offices are not authorized to approve
applications filed after March 27, 2000.  These additional payments do
not have to be requested by the producer.
&
COC has approved the producer’s CCC-547.
&
All program requirements have been met.
Note: All program provisions that applied to 1999 CDP also apply to issuing
the California Citrus payments.
B
Payment Factor
An additional 15.3 percent payment will be issued to eligible producers as defined
in subparagraph A.  This payment factor is the difference between:
&
84.9 percent payment factor used for 1998 CLDAP payments
&
69.6 percent payment factor used for 1999 CDP payments.
C
Assignments
County Offices shall process assignments and joint payments according to 63-FI
using program code “99CITRUS”.  Payments shall:
&
be assigned if CCC-36 was filed on or after October 29, 2000
&
not be assigned based on previous CCC-36’s filed for 1999 CDP.

General Payment Provisions (Continued)
D
Offsets
As with 1999 CDP payments, the additional payment for California Citrus losses
are not subject to administrative offset.
Exception:

against any outstanding debt that resulted from a 1999 CDP
overpayment.
E
Bankruptcy
County Offices shall contact the OGC Regional Attorney for guidance on issuing
California Citrus payments on all bankruptcy cases.

Handling Payment Limitation
A
Review
Payments for the 1998 CLDAP and 1999 CDP programs were factored as well as
the payment limitation amount needed to issue those payments.  Counties shall
ensure that the payment limitation amount has been set correctly.  Counties shall
also provide any additional unallocated payment limitation amounts to counties
with producers with citrus losses.
Note: Because of the complexity of the payment limitation factors with CLDAP
and CDP programs, several examples are illustrated in the remainder of this
paragraph showing the most common situations that may occur. 
B
County Office
Actions
County Offices shall take the following steps to ensure that payment limitation
allocations are set correctly.
Step
Action
1
Print a “Producer Payment History” report of all multi-county producers that received a 1999 CDP citrus loss
payment.
&
Divide the total 1999 CDP payment amount by .696; this is the minimum amount of payment limitation
amount that must be allocated to the county.  To determine the amount of the 1999 CDP payments issued,
total all “CHK/EFT” records; then subtract all “RECV” records.
&
The control county shall distribute any unallocated payment limitation to counties with citrus applications.
2
Ensure all 1999 CDP applications, that are approved, have been paid.  The County Offices shall run an “ALL”
payment batch to ensure all payments have been issued.  Counties shall then review the payment reports and
correct any problems that the reports indicate.
3
County Offices shall run an “All” overpayment register for 1999 CDP.  Correct all problems that the
overpayment register indicates.  If a producer has been overpaid, the county shall set up a receivable
immediately.

Handling Payment Limitation (Continued)
C
Example 1
In this example, the producer:
&
is a multi-county producer
&
applied for benefits on the citrus crop only
&
reached payment limitation on the citrus crop.
In County A, Joe Smith receives a 1999 CDP payment of $55,000, and in
County B a payment of $680.  The payment allocation amount must be set equal to
or greater than the payment amount divided by .696:
&
County A - $55,000 divided by .696 = $79,023
&
County B - $680 divided by .696 = $977.
The payment limitation amount must be at least $79,023 in County A and $977 in
County B.
D
Example 2
In this example, the producer:
&
is a multi-county producer
&
applied for benefits on multiple crops (wheat and citrus)
&
reached payment limitation on the citrus crop.
In County A, Steve Jones received a 1999 CDP payment of:
&
$10,440 for wheat
&
$17,400 for citrus. 
In County B, he received a payment of $27,840 for citrus.
The payment allocation amount must be set equal to or greater than the total
payment amount issued in each county divided by .696:
&
County A - $10,440 + $17,400 divided by .696 = $40,000
&
County B - $27,840 divided by .696 = $40,000
The payment limitation amount must be at least $40,000 in both counties.

Example 3
In this example, the producer:
&
is a multi-county producer
&
applied for benefits on multiple crops (citrus and apples)
&
reached payment limitation on the apple crop.
In County A, Sara Johnson received a 1999 CDP payment of:
&
$24,360 for citrus
&
$1,392 for apples.
In County B, she received payments of:
&
$6,960 for citrus
&
$3,480 for apples.
The payment allocation amount must be set equal to or greater than the total
payment amount divided by .696:
&
County A - $24,360 + $1,392 divided by .696 = $37,000
&
County B - $6,960 + $3,480 divided by .696 = $15,000.
The payment limitation amount in County A must be at least $37,000 and in
County B at least $15,000

Timing of
Payments
On March 7, 2001, KC-ITSDO transmitted software to County Offices that
provides the menu option to the California Citrus payments.  However, this
software transmission only provides the menu.  The actual payment software is
included in County Release No. 454 to arrive in County Offices on or about
March 7, 2001.
Once the transmitted software and County Release No. 454 are installed, County
Offices shall immediately process payments to eligible producers.

Handling Overpayments
A
Introduction
An automated overpayment process is not being developed for the California
Citrus payment for the following reasons.
&
Since payments are based on 1999 CDP applications that were filed before
February 25, 2000, all application and eligibility data should be loaded properly
in the system.
&
The limited number of applications does not warrant dedication of the
resources required to automate an overpayment process.
B
County Office
Action
If it is determined that payments are based on inaccurate application or eligibility
data, County Offices shall:
&
manually determine the overpayment amount of the California Citrus payment
&
establish a receivable in CRS according to 67-FI using program code
“99CITRUS”
&
notify the producer of the overpayment and provide appeal rights.
Reminder:
County Offices shall not cancel payments already issued to
producers to create a receivable.  See paragraph 5 for additional
information on payment cancellations.
