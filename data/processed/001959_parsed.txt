SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
FOR 
MEDICAL DEVICES: CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE (CGMP), 
QUALITY SYSTEM (Q/S) REGULATION 
21 CFR PART 820 
OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
A. 
JUSTIFICATION 
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting extension of approval for information 
collection requirements in 21 CFR Part 820 (Attachment A).  Current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (CGMP) are set forth in this Quality System (QS) regulation.  The authority for this 
regulation is covered under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U. S. C. 
sections 351, 352, 360, 360c, 360d, 360e, 360h, 360i, 360j, 360l, 371, 374, 381, and 383 
(Attachment B). 
 
1. 
Circumstances Making the Collection of Information Necessary 
 
The CGMP/QS regulation includes requirements for purchasing and service controls; clarifies 
recordkeeping requirements for device failure and complaint investigations; clarifies requirements 
for verifying/validating production processes and process or product changes; and, clarifies 
requirements for product acceptance activities, quality data evaluations and corrections of non-
conforming product/quality problems.  Requirements are compatible with specifications in 
international quality standards, ISO 9001, "Quality Systems Model for Quality Assurance in 
Design/ Development, Production, Installation, and Servicing.  See American National Standard 
ANSI/ASQC Q 9001-1994 which corresponds to ISO 9001: 1994.  Harmonization is fostered 
by SMDA Sec. 15 which added sect. 803 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (act) to 
encourage FDA to establish an Office of International Relations to work with foreign countries 
towards mutual recognition of CGMP requirements.

2. 
Purpose and Use of the Information 
 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
 
 
11
CGMP/QS information collections will assist FDA inspections of manufacturer compliance with 
quality system requirements encompassing design, production, installation and servicing processes. 
 Manufacturers must ensure that medical devices meet design specifications and that design 
specifications are effectively transferred from research and development to production.  FDA 
review of Medical Device Reports (MDRs) for 1991 showed that some 59 deaths and 929 
serious injuries were attributed to design-related device failures.  Manufacturer compliance with 
CGMP/QS requirements should decrease such failures and save manufacturers millions of dollars 
by avoiding recalls caused by inadequate design.  Since the last approval of this information 
collection, there has been some decrease noted of the number of firms with design-related recalls. 
 However, this regulation is still in its infancy and many firms have yet to design new products that 
incorporate design control requirements.  Over the next two years, we will begin to receive 
information pertaining to whether recalls are design related and better evaluate the effectiveness of 
the quality system regulation.  
 
“Harmonized” CGMP/QS requirements have benefited export oriented manufacturers because 
they are consistent with the ISO 9000 international quality standards.  The least expensive way for 
U.S. firms to meet the medical device directives of the European Union (EU) and obtain the EU 
mark to sell their products is to certify that their quality systems comply with the ISO standards.  
By complying with CGMP/QS requirements US manufacturers will satisfy both domestic and 
international regulatory requirements. 
 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
 
 
12
Not implementing the CGMP/QS regulation would result in the continuation of a significant 
number of preventable deaths and injuries, and in the loss by manufacturers of substantial savings 
attributable to reduced recall costs, improved manufacturing efficiency and improved access to 
international markets. 
 
3. 
Use of Information Technology and Burden Reduction 
 
In the Federal Register of March 20, 1997 (62 FR 13430) (Attachment C), FDA published a 
final rule establishing procedures for electronic records, electronic signatures, and electronic 
submissions.  Firms may use appropriate technology in accordance with this rule to comply with 
the CGMP/QS recordkeeping requirements. 
 
FDA is also using information technology to assist in the reduction of information burden to 
respondents of information queries.  Presently, respondents to FDA information collection’s may 
use computer word processing, electronic form, spreadsheet, and database software to collect 
and format information for submission to FDA.  FDA has reduced the burden of responding to 
regulatory statute through the use of these electronic applications, the Fax-On-Demand fax-back 
system, the Electronic Docket, and the Internet.   
 
In addition, FDA is currently receiving manufacturer’s application by computer word processing, 
electronic form and CD-ROM to assist in reducing manufacturer’s application submission 
burdens. However, in the event that FDA requests an applicant to deliver copies of their 
application to FDA, electronic storage allows for the fastest transmission of those records to 
FDA. 
 
FDA has attempted to maximize current technology to reduce burden for respondents of its data 
by the methods mentioned above.  FDA will continue to pursue methods of applying technology 
to reduce burden to the respondents of its information collections. 
 
4. 
Efforts to Identify Duplication and Use of Similar Information 
 
Required information is available from individual manufacturers and not other sources.  FDA is the 
only regulatory Federal agency responsible for collecting such information. 
 
5. 
Impact on Small Business or Other Small Entities 
 
CGMP/QS requirements have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.  
However, when the CGMP/QS became final rule and exempted the majority of Class I device 
manufacturers from design controls, FDA estimated a decrease in compliance costs by 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
 
 
13
approximately $6.8 million, 60 percent of which would have been borne by small businesses.  By 
excluding component manufacturers from CGMP/QS requirements, FDA eliminated potential 
rises in the cost of components purchased by small businesses.  By deleting "complete" and "all" 
from many previous recordkeeping provisions, FDA provides small businesses with greater 
flexibility in determining the type and quantity of necessary records.  By harmonizing requirements 
with international standards, FDA provides benefits to small firms pursuing exports since they no 
longer need to expend resources to maintain a quality system for FDA regulated domestic 
products and another for foreign regulated exports. 
 
Small firms are assisted by the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) within FDA's 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). DSMA was established, as required by the 
1976 Amendments to the act, to provide technical and other non-financial assistance to small 
firms, expressly to aid them in complying with the requirements of the act.  DSMA participates in 
and conducts conferences, workshops; and seminars on the application and interpretation of 
relevant regulations.  DSMA also consults with small firms; and develops and disseminates 
CGMP educational materials, thereby reducing small business expenditures to achieve 
compliance.  DSMA staff is available to respond to questions via a toll-free telephone number, 
and provides additional information to firms on its website, located at http:\\www.fda.gov (once 
on the site, click on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) link, and choose the 
DSMA link). 
 
6. 
Consequences of Collecting the Information Less Frequently 
 
There are no technical or legal obstacles to the collection of information required by this 
collection.  Sect. 510(h) of the act requires FDA to inspect registered manufacturers of Class II 
(special controls) devices and Class III (premarket approval) devices, at least once every 2  
years.  FDA inspects manufacturers of Class I (general controls) devices as often as feasible.  If 
inspection reviews were conducted less frequently, FDA? s effectiveness in increasing the safety 
of medical devices by monitoring manufacturers?  compliance with CGMPs, would be significantly 
reduced. 
 
7. 
Special Circumstances Relating to the Guidelines of 5 CFR 1320.5. 
 
 
Collections are consistent with 5 CFR 1320.5 except for the requirement in  820.180(b). This 
section requires records to be retained for a period equivalent to the design and expected life of 
the device, but in no case less than 2 years from release for distribution.  This is necessary since 
many devices are labeled for extended periods of use.  For example, pacemaker life expectancy 
depends on battery life, which is usually more than 3 years.  Manufacturers must retain records as 
required above in order to perform failure/problem investigations and FDA must have access to 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
 
 
14
these records to conduct long range investigations protecting public health.  
 
8. 
Comments in Response to the Federal Register Notice and Efforts to Consult Outside 
Agency 
 
 
Notice has been published in the Federal Register on February 19,2004 (68 FR 7755) soliciting 
comments on this information collection prior to its submission to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) as required by 5 CFR 1320.8(d) (Attachment D).  No comments were received. 
 
 
FDA staff met with or discussed CGMP/QS requirements on numerous occasions over the last 3 
years.  CDRH is proactive in ensuring that the medical device industry and other affected 
individuals are made aware of on-going issues relating to the CGMP/QS regulations.  The Agency 
Medical Device GMP/QS expert has participated in numerous conferences and seminars relating 
to the CGMP/QS regulatory requirements.  During these sessions, our GMP/QS experts share 
information through speeches and panel discussions that provide a forum for open discussion.  
During these discussions guidance and direction is often given to the audience to help them 
understand their regulatory responsibilities under the GMP/QS regulation.  In addition, issues are 
sometimes identified by the audience that provide the Agency areas that we may need to clarify to 
affected individuals. 
 
9. 
Explanation of Any Payment or Gift to Respondents 
 
There is no payment or gift to respondents of this information collection. 
 
10. Assurance of Confidentiality Provided to Respondent 
 
CDRH complies with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and FDA?s Public 
Information regulation at 21 CFR Part 20, 820.180(a) of the CGMP/QS regulation provides that 
records deemed confidential by manufacturers may be marked to aid FDA in determining what 
information may be disclosed under 21 CFR Part 20. 
 
11. Justification for Sensitive Questions. 
 
Information required by the CGMP/QS regulation doesn’t include questions of a sensitive nature, 
such as sexual behavior and attitudes, religious beliefs or matters considered private. 
 
12. Estimate of Hour Burden Including Annualized Hourly Costs 
 
The CGMP/QS regulation applies to some 8,254 respondents. These recordkeepers consist of 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073 
 
 
 
15
8,188 original respondents and an estimated 66 hospitals which re-manufacture or re-use single 
use medical devices.  They include manufacturers, subject to all requirements and contract 
manufacturers, specification developers, repackers/relabelers and contract sterilizers, subject only 
to requirements applicable to their activities.  Hospital re-manufacturers of single use medical 
devices (SUD’s) are now defined to be manufacturers under guidelines issued by the Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB).  
Respondents to this collection have no reporting activities, but must make required records 
available for review or copying during FDA inspection.  The regulation contains additional 
recordkeeping requirements in such areas as design control, purchasing, installation, and 
information relating to the re-manufacture of single use medical devices. The estimates for burden 
are derived from those incremental tasks that were determined when the new CGMP/QS 
regulation became final as well as those carry-over requirements.  The carry-over requirements 
are based on decisions made by the agency on July 16, 1992, under OMB Paperwork Reduction 
Act submission No. 0910-0073.  This still provides valid baseline data. 
 
FDA estimates respondents will have a total annual recordkeeping burden of approximately 
2,833,020 hours (shown as 2,833,020 in Table 1 of this justification statement due to rounding).  
This figure also consists of approximately 143,052 hours spent on a start-up basis by 650 new 
firms.  Table 1 below identifies burden estimates per sections of the regulation.

Explanation of Recordkeeping Burden Estimate  
 
Burden (labor) hour and cost estimates were originally developed under FDA contract by Eastern 
Research Group, Inc. (ERG) in 1996 when the CGMP/QS regulation became final.  These figures 
are still accurate.  Additional factors considered in deriving estimates included: 
 
?? Establishment type: Query has been made of CDRH’s registration/listing data bank and count 
was 8188 domestic firms subject to CGMPs.  In addition, hospitals which re-use or re-
manufacture devices are now considered manufacturers under new FDA guidance.  During 
the last report it was estimated that out of the 6,000 hospitals in the U.S., 1/3 of them (or 
2,000 hospitals) will re-use or re-manufacture single use medical devices. After investigations 
of many hospitals and the changes in enforcements of FDA’ requirements for hospitals, the 
numbers of re-use or re-manufactures of single use medical devices have decrease from the 
estimated 2000 to an estimated 66 hospitals. Thus, the number of manufacturers will increase 
from 8,188 to 8,254 making that the total number of firms subject to CGMPs. 
 
?? Potentially affected establishments: Except for manufacturers, not every type of firm is subject 
to every CGMP/QS requirement.  For example, all are subject to Quality Policy (820.20(a)), 
Document Control (820.40), and other requirements, whereas only manufacturers and

specification developers are subject to Subpart C, Design Controls.  The type of firm subject 
to each requirement was identified by the ERG. 
 
?? FDA estimated the burden hours (and costs) for the previous CGMP regulation in 1992. That 
estimate was submitted to OMB on May 4, 1992, under OMB Paperwork Reduction Act 
submission No. 0910-0073.  It was approved by OMB on 7/16/92 and expired on June 30, 
1995.  The methodology used is different than that used by ERG in estimating incremental 
tasks when the new CGMP/QS became final rule.  Nevertheless, the agency believes its 1992 
estimate adequately represents labor hours (and costs) needed to comply with previous 
CGMP requirements carried over into the new CGMP/QS regulation. The 1992 estimate 
used 9,289 respondents (rather than 8,254 respondents), which compensates for differences 
in methodology. 
 
?? FDA estimates that some 650 “new” establishments (marketing devices for the first time) will 
expend some 143,052 “development” hours on a one-time start-up basis to develop records 
and procedures for the CGMP/QS regulation.   
 
?? FDA estimates that annual labor hours are apportioned as follows: 40% - to requirements 
dealing with manufacturing specifications, process controls and the DHR; 20% - to 
requirements dealing with components and acceptance activities; 25% - to requirements 
dealing with equipment, records (the DMR and QSR), complaint investigations, 
labeling/packaging and reprocessing/investigating product nonconformance; and, 15 % - to 
quality audit, traceability, handling, distribution, statistical, and other requirements.   
 
Estimate of Burden Hour Cost 
 
FDA estimates the total annualized burden hour cost at $43.1 million.  Total Burden Hours of 
2,833,020 x $15.20 per hour. 
 
 
13. Estimate of the Other Total Annual Cost Burden to Respondent or Recordkeepers 
 
Based on data developed by ERG, respondents will incur about $1.2 million in annual additional 
supplier auditing requirements, 21 CFR 820.50(a).

consideration the grade levels of headquarters personnel, field investigators and lab technicians. 
 
15. Explanation for Program Changes or Adjustments 
 
At the time of the last approval of this information collection, the old CGMP regulation was 
replaced and implemented by the new CGMP/QS regulation.  The newly implemented 
CGMP/QS regulation was approved by OMB on October7, 1996.  Some changes have evolved 
since the last approval was granted.  Adjustments have been made to the burden hours, 
operational and maintenance costs and total number of respondents.  These changes are based on 
the following factors: 
 
It is believed that the estimated numbers for hospitals, which re-use or re-manufactures single use 
medical devices, has decrease because of a series of FDA investigations and the enforcement 
requirements of FDA.  As a result it is estimated that 66 hospitals re-use or re-manufacturer single 
use medical devices.  
 
? ? One-time incremental tasks associated with implementing the new regulation have been 
eliminated and the annual burden as a result of the new regulation has been combined with the 
carry-over tasks from the old regulation.  
 
Supporting Statement - OMB No. 0910-0073

? ? One-Time operating and maintenance costs associated with the incremental tasks has been 
eliminated. 
 
? ? Thus, the number of burden hours has decreased by 334,650 hours (from 3,167,670 hours to 
2,833,020 hours) and the amount of annual Operating and Maintenance costs has remained 
the same ($1,181,925).  The burden hour decreases are attributable to recalculation of the 
burden and costs due to experience in implementing this regulation by FDA. 
 
16. Plans for Tabulation and Publication and Project Time Schedule 
 
The results of this collection of information will not be published. 
 
17. Reason(s) Display of OMB Expiration Date is Inappropriate 
 
Currently, CDRH is not requesting an exemption for display of the OMB expiration date. 
 
18. Exceptions to Certification for Paperwork Reduction Act Submissions 
 
Currently, CDRH is not requesting an exemption to Certification for the Paperwork Reduction 
Act Submissions.  There are no exceptions to the certification statement identified in Item 19 of 
the OMB Form 83-I.
