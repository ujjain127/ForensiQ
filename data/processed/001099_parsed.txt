Abstract
Identiﬁcation of 440 taxa of plant macrofossils in 14 rodent (Abrocoma) middens collected from 2800 to 3590 m
elevation at the latitude of Arica, Chile (181S) provide snapshots of vegetation in the northernmost Atacama Desert over
the past 3000 years. Midden ﬂoras show considerable stability throughout the late Holocene, which may be due in part to
the broad elevational ranges of many perennial species and midden insensitivity to changes in plant community structure.
The greatest variability is found in annuals in the Prepuna, a climatically sensitive zone. This variability, however might
also arise from the brevity of midden depositional episodes. As the ﬁrst midden record from the Arica–Parinacota Region
(Chile’s northernmost administrative region), this study demonstrates the potential for future midden research in this area.

1. Introduction
Plant macrofossils preserved in rodent middens have proven a valuable source of late Quaternary
paleoecological and paleoclimatological evidence in arid and semi-arid regions of the Western Hemisphere
and other parts of the world (Betancourt, 2004; Betancourt and Saavedra, 2002; Betancourt et al., 1990;
Pearson and Betancourt, 2002). During the past decade, much of the focus has been on developing the midden
record from the Paciﬁc slope of the central Andes (16–261S) just above hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert
in southern Peru and northern Chile (Betancourt et al., 2000; Holmgren et al., 2001; Latorre et al., 2002, 2003,
2005, 2006; Maldonado et al., 2005). These studies have been pivotal in chronicling past pluvial events when
plant distributions were displaced up to 1000 m in elevation, with the midden assemblages able to resolve both
the seasonality and amount of precipitation. As in North America, hundreds of radiocarbon-dated and

archived middens from the Atacama are now being mined for a variety of studies (e.g., Kuch et al., 2002).
Here, we report on plant macrofossil assemblages spanning the last 3200 yr BP from 14 fossil rodent middens
collected in the Andean Precordillera east of Arica, Chile, not far from the Peruvian border. Middens from
this region can provide vegetation histories to support interpretation of the rich archeological legacies of the
Atacama region.
Rodent middens are deposits of plant materials (seeds, leaves, twigs, bones, pollen, and fecal pellets) encased
in crystallized urine, and are abundantly preserved in rock shelters, crevices, and caves in the Atacama Desert.
Both Pleistocene and Holocene-aged plant macrofossils are often identiﬁable at the species level, providing
high taxonomic resolution. Rock dwelling rodents typically have very limited foraging ranges so these deposits
also represent the surrounding vegetation with a high degree of spatial resolution. A recent taphonomic study
of Abrocoma middens from northern Chile indicated that no plants from beyond 30 m were found within
modern middens (Salinas and Latorre, 2007). Radiocarbon dates from midden plant materials or fecal pellets
provide excellent chronological control. However, middens are stratigraphically discontinuous; therefore
individual middens represent ‘‘snapshots’’ of ﬂoral assemblages that have to be collated to develop local
chronologies of vegetation change.
Midden-forming rodents in northern Chile include Abrocoma cinerea (Abrocomidae), Lagidium viscacia
(Chinchillidae), and Phyllotis spp. (Cricetidae). Based on fecal pellets, all middens in our study were made by
Abrocoma, although the diurnal L. viscacia was often spotted on rocky hillslopes. A. cinerea has a generalist
diet (Corte´ s et al., 2002), and in addition to caching food, these rodents collect plant materials for nest and den
construction, resulting in midden assemblages that are representative of hillslope vegetation within the
foraging ranges of the animals. Although the surrounding vegetation is well represented in modern A. cinerea
middens, dietary selectivity may increase in more productive environments (Salinas and Latorre, 2007) such as
in our study area, potentially introducing bias. A bias in plant abundance in the midden record may also result
from variations in the length of depositional episodes and a tendency for rodents to collect plants growing
nearest to the midden.
2. Study area
2.1. Geology and climate
The study area is located on the Paciﬁc slope of the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes between 2800 and
3590 m elevation (Fig. 1). This slope consists primarily of Cretaceous–Tertiary volcanic rocks, especially
ignimbrites. Ignimbrites form from very mobile volcanic ﬂows consisting of ash particles and heated volcanic
gases, with some of the most massive deposits in northern Chile covering 1000–3000 km3 (Seyfried et al.,
1999). Abundant caves and rockshelters within the ignimbrites provide locations suitable for midden
preservation throughout the study area. Tertiary eolian and alluvial sediments ﬁll the valleys to the west.
Deep, steep-walled valleys oriented east–west surrounding Arica are a result of tectonic destabilization and the
collapse of massive packets of sediments (Seyfried et al., 1999). Several volcanoes with peaks between 5000
and 6000 m punctuate the landscape.
The climate of the study area is hyperarid due to a combination of factors including location beneath the
South Paciﬁc Anticyclone high-pressure zone, the cold upwelling Peruvian Current offshore that creates a
temperature inversion and inhibits convection, and the rainshadow effect of the Andes blocking moisture from
the Amazon. The scarce precipitation that does occur comes from three primary sources. At elevations below
1000 m thick fog develops during the winter due to a temperature inversion off the Paciﬁc coast. Where it
intersects the steep coastal slopes it provides sufﬁcient moisture to support ‘‘lomas’’ vegetation. These fog-
zone communities exist as bands of vegetation surrounded by hyperarid habitat and consist of highly variable
mixtures of annuals, short-lived perennials, succulents, and woody scrub vegetation, often with high levels of
endemicity (Rundel et al., 1991). During summer months, the South America Summer Monsoon (SASM)
brings convective moisture across the Andes as heating occurs over the Amazon Basin. Because of the strong
rainshadow effect of the Andes, much of the moisture from summer monsoon storms that cross the Andes falls
at high elevations and rarely reaches the coast (Houston and Hartley, 2003). Interannual summer precipitation
variability is primarily inﬂuenced by El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the strength and position of

the Bolivian High and South Atlantic convergence zone, with wetter conditions association with La Nin˜ a
events and drier ones with El Nin˜ os (Garreaud et al., 2003; Lenters and Cook, 1999; Vuille and Keimig, 2004;
Zhou and Lau, 1998). Further to the south (4251S), rainfall occurs primarily during winter when the South
Paciﬁc Anticyclone weakens and allows polar fronts and cut-off low pressure cells to travel northward (Miller,
1976). On rare occasions, these cells penetrate as far north as the study area to generate winter precipitation
(Vuille, 1999).
Arica, located on the coast at 5 m elevation, receives less than 1 mm of precipitation/year. For the period of
record from 1931 to 1989, most of the scant moisture fell during winter months (June–September) in years
with strong El Nin˜ o events: 1940–1941, 1957–1958, 1972–1973, and 1982–1983 (Ortlieb and Machare´ , 1993),
with smaller amounts occurring in summer months (December–February). At the higher elevations of our
study area, SASM precipitation dominates and contributes 10’s to 100’s of millimeters of precipitation per
year, depending on elevation. Murmuntani, located at 3280 m and less than 20 km northeast of our site at
Cerro Copaquilla, receives an annual average of 156 mm of precipitation, while Parinacota Volcano at 4395 m
receives 372 mm (Arroyo et al., 1988). Because vegetation in the study area is primarily limited by the amount
of summer rainfall, which varies as a function of rainout with elevation and distance from the crest of the
Andes, any displacement of species up or downslope recorded in rodent middens should reﬂect changes in the
amount of precipitation received.
2.2. Vegetation
Vegetation in northern Chile can be divided into several vegetation bands. Vegetation classiﬁcation and
characteristic species are based on previous studies (Villagra´ n et al., 1982, 1983) and our own observations. A
table of plant taxa including family, growth form, and common name is available in Appendix A, electronic
version only. With the exception of occasional herbaceous lomas vegetation below 1000 m, the Cordillera
Occidental below 2700 m consists of ‘‘Absolute Desert’’ where plants are absent from the landscape. Above
2700 m, Absolute Desert gives way to the Prepuna located in the Andean Precordillera and consisting of
widely spaced xerophytic plants characterized by the shrubs Atriplex imbricata, Ambrosia artemisioides, the
cactus Browningia, and the annuals Calandrinia, Lepidium, and Cistanthe. The Tolar, or Puna, between 3400

and 4000 m is a diverse shrub belt characterized by scrub-type vegetation including Ephedra breana, Fabiana
ramulosa, Diplostephium, and Baccharis tola. The transitional zone between the Tolar and High Tolar includes
tussock grasses and cushion plants, but is dominated by shrubs of the Asteraceae family (Baccharis,
Chuquiraga, and Parastrephia). The High Tolar above 4000 m is dominated by the tussock grasses Festuca
and Deyeuxia and the cushion plants Azorella compacta and Pycnophyllum bryoides. A pronounced vegetation
gradient with elevation is evident in the transect we measured from 2700 to 4700 m along the northern oil
pipeline road (Fig. 2).
3. Methods
Nine rodent middens were collected from the Puquios Norte site near the Puquios Railroad Station
(3443–3589 m) and ﬁve from Cerro Copaquilla (2950–3140 m) southeast of Zapahuira (Fig. 1), and represent
the ﬁrst midden records from the Arica–Parinacota Region of northernmost Chile. The elevation of Cerro
Copaquilla is located within the Prepuna zone and the elevation of Puquios Norte corresponds to the
transition between the Prepuna and Tolar zones. Middens were processed and analyzed according to well-
established procedures (Spaulding et al., 1990). In the laboratory, middens were examined for stratigraphic
discontinuities and separated into discrete units if necessary, the outer weathering rind removed with a chisel,
and the samples placed into buckets of water to dissolve the crystallized rodent urine (amberat) and to release
midden materials. After wet screening and oven drying, sample weights ranged from 56 to 258 g. Dry midden
material was screened through 2 mm (No. 10) and 1 mm (No. 18) sieves to separate size classes and facilitate
sorting of plant remains. The entire 2-mm portion and a 1-g subsample from the 1-mm portion were sorted for
plant macrofossils and used to assign relative abundances. All remaining material from the 1-mm fraction was
also examined for rare types. Macrofossil abundances were quantiﬁed using a relative abundance scale of 1–5,

Plant taxa were identiﬁed based on comparison with modern reference materials including ﬁeld collections and
herbarium specimens. Radiocarbon analyses were done by Geochron Laboratories in Billerica, MA and the
dates calibrated using the CALIB 4.4 Intcal04 curve (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993). All values within the text are
reported as the midpoint of the calibrated 2s age ranges (Table 1) to facilitate comparison with other records.
4. Results and discussion
The temporal coverage of the 14 middens is uneven, probably due to the limited number of samples
(Table 1). The oldest midden was dated to 3180 yr BP and the next oldest midden does not occur until
1410 yr BP. There is, however, relatively good coverage for the last 1410 years. Given the prevalence of
middens 410,000 yr old in the central and southern Atacama (Latorre et al., 2002, 2003, 2006; Maldonado
et al., 2005), we were surprised by the lack of older middens at the sites that we sampled in the Arica region. If
there is actually a physical reason for this, it may have to do with higher relative humidity, either in general or
episodically, which would prevent or reverse crystallization of rodent urine. Discovery of older middens may
require more intensive survey than was feasible in the present study.
Macrofossils from more than 40 taxa in 19 families were identiﬁed to genus or species. The relative
abundances of select taxa through time are plotted in Fig. 3. The midden record is characterized by the
apparent stability of many species. Both modern and past vegetation assemblages contain a mix of Prepuna
and Tolar species with a small number of plants from the Tolar–High Tolar transition zone. It is apparent
from our transect (Fig. 2) that many of the stable elements have broad elevational ranges and occur across
vegetation zones. Species with large elevational ranges may not be sensitive to small variations in
precipitation. The persistence of species with more restricted elevational ranges such as Tarasa operculata,
Sisymbrium, Opuntia sphaerica, and Coreopsis suaveolens, however, suggests that the amount of precipitation
received in the study area during the late Holocene may have been relatively stable.
The species that exhibit the greatest variability in our record are annuals found in the Prepuna zone. These
include Cardionema cf. andina, Cistanthe, Cristaria, Lepidium, Nolana, and Parietaria debilis. Because SASM
precipitation rains out at higher elevations, the lower Prepuna zone tends to receive smaller amounts and less
reliable precipitation. Adequate germination conditions are met only in occasional years, so the greater
temporal variability of annuals, compared to perennials that can establish in good years and persist through
less favorable ones, is not surprising. On the other hand, annuals can probably establish in Absolute Desert
uninhabitable by perennials. The fringe of vegetation near Absolute Desert is transient through time due to
occasional ‘‘invasions’’ by annuals into Absolute Desert. This is possible due to the longer viability of annual
seed banks. Arroyo et al. (1988) have noted that the percentage of annuals between 18 and 191S is greatest at
lower elevations (2000–3000 m), although annual cover ﬂuctuates widely between wet and dry years. In
addition, annuals require warmer conditions, which may also explain their greater abundance at lower
elevations. These factors may likewise be responsible for the patchy record of annual grasses, which are more
common at the lower elevation site of Cerro Copaquilla. The greatest number of grasses and Prepuna annuals
are present at 800 and 390 yr BP at Copaquilla and 3180, 1410, 590, and 250 yr BP at Puquios Norte, possibly
denoting periods of increased precipitation. Replication of this pattern from more middens will help verify
whether the greater number of annuals during these periods does indeed reﬂect increased precipitation.
Mid- to late-Holocene climate proxy records show conﬂicting precipitation levels between the Altiplano and
the Paciﬁc slope of the Andes. After 3500 yr BP lake levels (Abbott et al., 2003; Baker et al., 2001) and ice
cores (Thompson et al., 1998) suggest the onset of wetter conditions on the Altiplano. Superimposed on this
trend are periods of lowered lake levels from 3200 to 2800, 2400 to 2200, 1700 to 1500, and 900 to 600 yr BP
(Abbott et al., 1997, 2003). Mourguiart et al. (1998) see a similar rise in Lake Titicaca water levels after
4200 yr BP, a dry phase around 2200 yr BP, and a ﬁnal wet phase after 600 yr BP. Although Lake Titicaca
records indicate increased moisture after 600 yr BP, a core from Lago Chungara´ (181150S) shows this was
interrupted by periods of increased salinity and lower water levels between 1880–1905 and 1935–1950 AD
(Valero-Garce´ s et al., 2003). At Laguna Seca (181110S) an increase in herbaceous pollen suggests drier
conditions beginning 4000–3000 yr BP, although this change in vegetation may result from the onset of

camelid pastoralism rather than changes in moisture supply (Baied and Wheeler, 1993). Clearly, there is not
enough agreement among records to present an uniﬁed picture of late-Holocene climate on the Altiplano.
Unlike the Altiplano, records from the Paciﬁc slope of the Andes indicate generally drier conditions during
the late Holocene. Wetter periods superimposed on this drying trend are often out of phase with Altiplano
records. Wetland deposits from Zapahuira Springs (18–191S), located in close proximity to our study site,
dating from 3100 to 1300 and 1200 to 400 yr BP and springs at Quebrada Puripica (231S) dating from 2600 to
1300 yr BP indicate higher water table levels during times of lowered water levels in Altiplano lakes (Rech,
2001; Rech et al., 2003). Middens from 22 to 231S near the Salar de Atacama also suggest wet conditions from
3490 to 2320 yr BP (Latorre et al., 2006), 1800 to 1200 yr BP (Latorre et al., 2003), and 800 yr BP (Latorre
et al, 2006; Maldonado et al., 2005). In Peru, Lago Aricota (171220S) likewise developed high stands at 1700
and 1300 yr BP (Placzek et al., 2001).
Our midden record, which is admittedly sparse, indicates vegetation from the Arica area has been relatively
stable for at least 1410 yr BP, and possibly for as long as 3180 yr BP. The trends towards drier conditions noted
in other records from the Paciﬁc slope of the Andes and ﬂuctuations between wetter and drier conditions seen
in records elsewhere in the region are not evident in our record. Instead, the arid Paciﬁc slope of the Andes at
the latitude of Arica supported a harsh but stable environment occupied by xerophytic shrubs, annuals, and
cacti. However, as stated previously, this apparent stability may simply be a reﬂection of the broad elevational
ranges of several perennial species present in the record. Also, because midden assemblages are subject to bias
due to ﬁltering by rodents, macrofossils species presence or absence data are generally more reliable than
macrofossil relative abundances and changes in plant community structure (species abundances) may or may
not be recorded in the midden record (Holmgren et al., 2001). In any case, the cause of discrepancies in records
from the Altiplano and Paciﬁc slope of the Andes remains unresolved. It is possible that these discrepancies
are due to variations in temporal resolution, response time, and/or record sensitivity. They may also result
from the geographical complexity of the regional climate and diverse controls on interannual variability in
northern Chile (Vuille and Keimig, 2004).
Despite some uncertainty in the climatic interpretation possible from this record, our study clearly
demonstrates the potential for future midden studies in northernmost Chile. As in the central Atacama
Desert, rodent middens in northernmost Chile represent a key resource for reconstructing late Quaternary
vegetation and evaluating climatic evidence derived from paleohydrologic records. In order to increase
the scope of inference, we suggest that larger numbers of middens will be needed to both increase tem-
poral coverage and resolution, while allowing for greater replication of reconstructed vegetation assembl-
ages and patterns. Finally, identiﬁcation of more sensitive areas for prospecting is needed. Whereas
many middens have been collected near the lower limits of vascular plants in the central and southern
Atacama, rocky areas suitable for midden preservation in the Arica area occur at higher elevations where the
vegetation may be less sensitive to precipitation variability and perhaps more sensitive to past variations
in temperature. Continued exploration will no doubt lead to more favorable collection locales in northern-
most Chile.
