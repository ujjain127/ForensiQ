Summary
The BOREAS TE-9 team collected several data sets related to chemical and photosynthetic properties
of leaves in boreal forest tree species. The purpose of the BOREAS TE-09 study was threefold: 1) to
provide in situ gas exchange data that will be used to validate models of photosynthetic responses to
light, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2); 2) to compare the photosynthetic responses of different
tree crown levels (upper and lower); and 3) to characterize the diurnal water potential curves for these
sites to get an indication of the extent to which soil moisture supply to leaves might be limiting
photosynthesis. The gas exchange data of the BOREAS NSA were collected to characterize diurnal gas
exchange and water potential of two canopy levels of five boreal canopy cover types: young jack pine,
old jack pine, old aspen, lowland old black spruce, and upland black spruce. These data were collected
between 27-May-1994 and 17-Sep-1994. The data are provided in tabular ASCII files.

3. Theory of Measurements
The gas exchange measurements were made with a closed portable photosynthetic system (LI-COR
LI-6200). As described in the LI-6200 Primer Manual, it contains three major components: a leaf
chamber, within which temperature and humidity measurements are made; the LI-6250, an infrared gas
analyzer (IRGA), which measures CO2 concentration and flow rate; and a control console. Air
temperature, leaf temperature, and relative humidity are measured in the leaf chamber. The pump in the
LI-6250 circulates air from the chamber to the analyzer, where CO2 concentration is measured, and
returns it to the chamber. The air flow through the LI-6250 can be diverted through soda lime to
remove CO2 for purposes of calibration.
      The flow valve is used to force some fraction of the flow through a tube of desiccant, which dries
the air. This proportional control feature is used to help maintain a steady humidity in the chamber
during a measurement. The flow rate of the air going through the desiccant is measured by a flow
meter.
      The IRGA can be used for absolute or differential measurement of CO2. As used with the LI-6200,
however, it is configured for absolute measurements.
      The methodology for measuring leaf area is described in Appendix K of the Experiment Plan,
Version 3.0. Aspen foliage is expressed as hemisurface area leaf area, while conifer foliage is
expressed as total surface area leaf area.
      The optical image analysis system (Decagon AgVision System) is an image analysis system that
works by first looking at an object through a video camera, then processing the image into discrete
numerical information with a digitizer and microcomputer, and finally displaying the image or other
information on a monitor for examination.
      For the measurement of Y (please note that in the text below, "Y" is the Greek symbol psi that is
generally used for water potential) response at high (less negative) Y, the cut end of the stem was
connected to a water reservoir. For lower (more negative) Y, the branches were taken out of water and
the cut surface of the stem was dried and sealed with silicone grease. The branches were then exposed
to light and permitted to transpire freely in an open space where the air was stirred continuously using
an electric fan. Sealing the cut surface of the branch allowed the branch to maintain a negative pressure
inside the xylem while transpiration continued. A pair of branches was chosen randomly at various
times for gas exchange measurement at 20 °C. The transpiration rate of the branch being measured was
kept very low by maintaining a high humidity in the cuvette (VPD < 0.8 kPa). It took from 3 to 6
hours for branches to reach their minimum Y. Immediately after the gas exchange measurement, the
stem of the branch was cut and the water potential was measured with a pressure chamber (Model 610,
PMS Instrument, Inc., Corvallis, OR, USA). By controlling the time interval between measurements,
a range of water potentials was achieved for black spruce and jack pine during both Intensive Field
Campaign (IFC)-2 and IFC-3.

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description
      LI-6200 portable gas exchange system (LI-COR), pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Co.),
drying oven, optical image analysis system (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA), top loading
weighing balance, IBM or compatible computer. 
4.1.1 Collection Environment
      Gas exchange and water potential measurements were measured by persons on the upper and
lower levels of canopy access towers. In the Young Jack Pine (YJP) stand, only 3-m ladders were
necessary. Leaf area measurements were determined in the lab. 
4.1.2 Source/Platform
      Gas exchange and water potential measurements were measured by persons on the upper and
lower levels of canopy access towers. In the YJP stand, only 3-m ladders were necessary. Leaf area
measurements were determined in the lab. 
4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives
      The purpose of this study was threefold as outlined in the BOREAS Experiment Plan, Version 3.0,
Appendix N, page N-34): 
•
To describe the diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and leaf water
potential of the principal forest types present at the BOREAS NSA and to determine the
precise nature of the environmental controls on these variables. 
•
To understand how these physiological properties and their environmental controls are
influenced by canopy position and period of the growing season. 
•
To use these data for partial model validation with a model parameterized from laboratory data
to be compared eventually to flux tower data from the NSA. 
4.1.4 Key Variables
      Diurnal water potential and net photosynthesis. 
4.1.5 Principles of Operation
      Gas exchange measurements were taken with a LI-COR 6200 system. Generally, a branch
(bearing leaves) section was placed into the cuvette for three 20-second measurements. The same
branch section was measured periodically throughout the day (approximately once every hour). At the
end of the day, these branch sections were harvested and stored in a freezer until leaf area was
determined.
      The volume displacement method (Appendix K of BOREAS Experiment Plan, Version 3.0) was
used to measure leaf area of conifer needles. The optical image analysis system was used to measure
needle lengths and aspen projected leaf areas.
      Water potential measurements were taken simultaneously with a pressure chamber on randomly
selected branch sections at the same canopy level as the photosynthetic measurements. These samples
were not kept for any further analyses. 
4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry
      Measurements were taken at two canopy levels: top and bottom. The heights of these samples
varied according to the location of the canopy access tower; however, they reflected the average
canopy as described in Section 2.2.3.1 of the BOREAS Experiment Plan, Version 3.0. Because the
canopy access towers moved between IFC periods, the canopy levels were not always exactly the
same. For example, the measurements at the old aspen stand ranged from approximately 13-15 m for
the upper canopy and 9-11 m for the lower canopy.

4.2 Calibration
      The LI-COR LI-6200 was sent to the manufacturer for calibration and general maintenance in
February 1994 before field work began (big mistake, see Section 10.1). The LI-6200 was examined
daily for page parameters, operating parameters, and clock setting; quantum sensor calculation
constant; CO2 analyzer calculation list; flow meter calculation list; relative humidity sensor calculation
list; and analyzer reference.
      Each sensor was checked daily and periodically to make sure it was responding as expected:
quantum sensor; air and leaf temperature match; IRGA temperature; flow meter; CO2 concentration;
and relative humidity. The zero and span for the CO2 analyzer were set daily. The flow meter was
zeroed frequently.
      The LI-6250 CO2 gas analyzer was calibrated daily according to instrument specifications (CO2
levels), while system tests (e.g., leak tests, boundary layer resistance, soda lime test, and desiccant (k)
test) were conducted periodically throughout each sampling day. Approximately every half hour, the
desiccant tube was shaken.
      Daily, the chambers were cleaned and the batteries recharged. The foam pads in the chamber were
changed after frequent usage and any noticeable damage.
      The optical image analysis system was calibrated according to instrument specifications each time
the system was opened or after it was left for a period of time. A fine ruler and flat disks of known
area were used in the calibration.
      The pressure chamber was inspected at the manufacturer's facility prior to field use. Safety checks
were conducted from time to time throughout the sampling period. 
4.2.1 Specifications
      The weighing balance was accurate to within 0.0001 g. The leaf area system was accurate to within
1%. The gas exchange system was accurate to 1 ppm CO2.
      The shape factor used for black spruce was 4, in accordance with the BOREAS Experiment Plan,
Appendix K, Version 3.0. Based on observations of two cross-sections of two needles per fascicle for
five fascicles for six jack pine trees from Thompson, Manitoba, an average shape factor of 4.59 (+/-
0.07) was calculated.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance
      The acceptable range for net photosynthetic measurements is not available at this revision. 
4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration
      The LI-COR LI-6200 was sent to the manufacturer for calibration and general maintenance in
February 1994 before field work began (big mistake, see Section 10.1). The LI-6200 was examined
daily for page parameters, operating parameters, and clock setting; quantum sensor calculation
constant; CO2 analyzer calculation list; flow meter calculation list; relative humidity sensor calculation
list; and analyzer reference.
      Each sensor was checked daily and periodically to make sure it was responding as expected:

area were used in the calibration.
      The pressure chamber was inspected at the manufacturer's facility prior to field use. Safety checks
were conducted from time to time throughout the sampling period. 
4.2.3 Other Calibration Information
      During IFC-1, the LI-6200 system had problems caused by the manufacturer's calibration. For the
days when this equipment problem occurred, the data could not be treated and thus will not be stored
in the BOREAS Information System (BORIS). Furthermore, the radio handsets that were distributed
to the field groups caused some failure in instrument functioning. Either the instrument completely shut
down or the periodic calibrations detected the influence of the handsets. These data have been cleaned
and removed from the data set available in BORIS. 
5. Data Acquisition Methods
Gas exchange and water potential measurements took place in five stands during daylight hours. Prior
to each measurement period, instruments were calibrated and placed onsite (for example, on canopy
access towers) for measurement. Five branches from randomly selected trees at a given canopy level
were identified and prepared by exposing only a desirable amount of foliage for gas exchange
measurement. Net photosynthesis was measured on these branches with a LI-COR LI-6200 system.
Ambient conditions were also obtained once or twice within the measurement period of the five
samples.
      Once a canopy level was completed, another was started, which normally was within a half hour.
Several cycles of measurement (upper and lower canopy) could be completed during a day. During the
first IFC only, samples were harvested after four to five cycles and another five were selected. This
was done to ensure that the measurement technique did not affect the sample by inducing high
respiration rates from damaged tissue, for example.
      A branch (bearing leaves) section was placed into the cuvette for three 20-second measurements.
This period varied in the first IFC, when investigators were trying to find an ideal measurement period
for the species being measured. Three 30-second measurements, or three 60-second intervals, were
found to be too long. Two 20- or 30-second intervals did not always provide enough data to determine
whether data errors existed. The same branch section was measured periodically throughout the day
Page 6
(approximately once every hour). At the end of the day, these branch sections were harvested and
stored in a freezer until leaf area was determined.
      The projected leaf areas of fresh aspen leaves that were harvested following the gas exchange
measurements were measured using an optical image analysis system. Projected leaf area is essentially
equivalent to half the area of the surface of the leaf (HASL) for flat leaves. Leaf area of each fresh
conifer sample was measured using the volume displacement method as described in Appendix K of
the BOREAS Experiment Plan (Version 3.0). Because precision work was required, the needles were
removed from the shoot, and the volume of the woody portion of the shoot was measured by
submerging it in the liquid-filled container on the balance. The needle volume was the difference
between the total volume and the woody volume. The length of all needles in the sample and the shoot
silhouette were measured using the optical image analysis system. The shape factors for black spruce
and jack pine respectively were 4.00 and 4.59.
      The silhouette area of conifer samples was measured by age class. (In the first IFC, however, there
was only one age class.) A conifer shoot was first snipped/clipped into two age classes. These two age
classes included (1) 1994 needles and (2) anything produced in 1993 and earlier. Each shoot section
was then randomly thrown under the camera lens and a silhouette measurement was taken. These
samples were then processed under the normal procedures for measuring leaf area (volume
displacement). 
6. Observations
6.1 Data Notes
      None given. 
6.2 Field Notes
      During IFC-1 only, canopy gas exchange measurements were made only in the upper canopy with
the exception of 27-May in the YJP stand. On this particular day, gas exchange measurements were
made on three branches per tree, for five trees for three canopy levels. (The data set will reflect this
difference in numbering.) Water potential measurements were made on 01-Jun and for subsequent
days. Identification errors have been corrected in the data set and are too detailed to list here.

Minimum Data Value -- The minimum value found in the column.
Maximum Data Value -- The maximum value found in the column.
Missng Data Value  -- The value that indicates missing data. This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Unrel Data Value   -- The value that indicates unreliable data.  This is used
                      to indicate an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the value was deemed to be
                      unreliable by the analysis personnel.
Below Detect Limit -- The value that indicates parameter values below the
                      instruments detection limits.  This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel determined
                      that the parameter value was below the detection
                      limit of the instrumentation.
Data Not Cllctd    -- This value indicates that no attempt was made to
                      determine the parameter value.  This usually
                      indicates that BORIS combined several similar but
                      not identical data sets into the same data base table
                      but this particular science team did not
                      measure that parameter.
Blank -- Indicates that blank spaces are used to denote that type of value.
N/A   -- Indicates that the value is not applicable to the respective column.
None  -- Indicates that no values of that sort were found in the column.

8. Data Organization
8.1 Data Granularity
      The smallest unit of data tracked by BORIS was that collected at a given site on a given date. 
8.2 Data Format(s)
      The Compact Disk-Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) files contain American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) numerical and character fields of varying length separated by
commas. The character fields are enclosed with single apostrophe marks. There are no spaces between
the fields.
      Each data file on the CD-ROM has four header lines of Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)
code at the top. When viewed with a Web browser, this code displays header information (data set
title, location, date, acknowledgments, etc.) and a series of HTML links to associated data files and
related data sets. Line 5 of each data file is a list of the column names, and line 6 and following lines
contain the actual data. 
9. Data Manipulations
9.1 Formulae
      During the data processing, the following formulae were used: 
•
water use efficiency (WUE)=(photosynthesis (µmol/m2/s) /transpiration(mmol/m2/s)) 
•
mesophyll conductance (GM)=( (photosynthesis (µmol/m2/s) /Intercellular CO2 concentration
(ppm)) x 1000) (Fites and Teskey, 1988) 
•
Ci/Ca: CINT: Intercellular CO2 concentration (ppm) / CO2 concentration (ppm)) 
9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms
      None at this time. 
9.2 Data Processing Sequence 
9.2.1 Processing Steps
      Data were stored in the LI-6200 system during the measurement day. Data were then
downloaded/transferred from the system to an IBM or IBM-compatible computer.
     When the true leaf areas for each sample were available, these values were entered into the LI-COR
programming software, and all gas exchange parameters subsequently were recomputed.
     Raw data for each day of data were printed and examined for anomalies in each line of data.
Subsequently, any data corresponding to each line of data that showed an anomaly were removed. For
example, a branch was normally placed in the cuvette for three repetitions of 20 seconds. If in one (or
more) of these repetitions, a parameter output was more than 25% out of range, then the entire line of
data was removed, leaving only the data corresponding to the 'clean' repetitions.
     Data were recomputed using the LI-COR software if any other errors in default parameters were
detected. For example, on occasion, the ratio of the stomatal conductance of one side of the leaf to the
other (STMRAT) was erroneously entered in the field.
     Using Excel (Version 5.0 for IBM), a program was written to process each cleaned data set. This
program did the following: 
•
Calculated new parameters that were not part of the LI-COR software system. These
parameters included water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance, and Ci:Ca ratios. 
•
Permitted the user to average the data depending on whether the data had been recomputed or
not. 
•
Permitted the user to average the data depending on whether there were two or three
repetitions of data, taking into account missing data. 
•
Formatted the data into column format. 
Page 15
Once the data were in a cleaned, column format, water potential values for each time period were
entered into the data set. Data in imperial units were converted to standard metric units. 
9.2.2 Processing Changes
      See Section 9.2.1. 
9.3 Calculations
      During the data processing, the following formulae were used: 
•
water use efficiency (WUE)=(photosynthesis (µmol/m2/s) /transpiration(µmol/m2/s)) 
•
mesophyll conductance (GM)=( (photosynthesis (µmol/m2/s) /Intercellular CO2 concentration
(ppm)) x 1000 ) (Fites and Teskey, 1988) 
•
Ci/Ca: CINT: Intercellular CO2 concentration (ppm) / CO2 concentration (ppm) 
9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments
      Raw data for each day of data were printed and examined for anomalies in each line of data.
Subsequently, any data corresponding to each line of data that showed an anomaly were removed. For
example, a branch was normally placed in the cuvette for three repetitions of 20 seconds. If in one (or
more) of these repetitions, a parameter output was more than 25% out of range, then the entire line of
data was removed, leaving only the data corresponding to the 'clean' repetitions.
      Data were recomputed using the LI-COR software if any other errors in default parameters were
detected. For example, on occasion, the ratio of the stomatal conductance of one side of the leaf to the
other (STMRAT) was erroneously entered in the field.
      Using the software Excel (Version 5.0 for IBM), a program was written to process each cleaned
data set. This program did the following: 
•
Calculated new parameters that were not part of the LI-COR software system. These
parameters included water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance, and Ci:Ca ratios. 
•
Permitted the user to average the data depending on whether the data had been recomputed or
not. 
•
Permitted the user to average the data depending on whether there were two or three
repetitions of data, taking into account missing data. 4) Formatted the data into column
format. 
Once the data were in a cleaned, column format, water potential values for each time period were
entered into the data set. Data in imperial units were converted to standard metric units. 
9.3.2 Calculated Variables
water use efficiency (WUE)
mesophyll conductance (GM)
intercellular CO2 concentration(ppm) 
9.4 Graphs and Plots
      None submitted. 
10. Errors
10.1 Sources of Error
      During IFC-1, the LI-6200 system had problems caused by the manufacturer's calibration. For
days when this equipment problem occurred, the data could not be treated and thus will not be stored
in BORIS. Furthermore, the radio handsets that were distributed to the field groups caused some
failure in instrument functioning. Either the instrument completely shut down or the periodic
calibrations detected the handset influence. These data have been cleaned and removed from the data
set available in BORIS.
Page 16
     All erroneous default parameters were adjusted. Anomalies in each line of data were removed. For
example, a branch was normally placed in the cuvette for three repetitions of 20 seconds. If in one (or
more) of these repetitions, a parameter output was more than 25% out of range, then the entire line of
data was removed, leaving only the data corresponding to the 'clean' repetitions. Most often these
anomalies could not be explained. However, a sudden burst in light during the measurement or a poor
electrical signal could cause these kinds of errors. These out-of-range errors were detected and
removed. See Section 9.2.1 for additional details. 
10.2 Quality Assessment 
10.2.1 Data Validation by Source
      All known errors were removed. 
10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment
      All known errors were removed, yielding a high degree of confidence in this data set. 
10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters
      No measurement errors are known at this time. 
10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments
      Data were compared to results observed in the laboratory, and results are within a realistic range. 
10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center
      Data were examined for general consistency and clarity. 
11. Notes

The BOREAS TE-9 team collected several data sets related to chemical and photosynthetic properties
of leaves in boreal forest tree species. The purpose of the BOREAS TE-09 study was threefold: 1) to
provide in situ gas exchange data that will be used to validate models of photosynthetic responses to
light, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2); 2) to compare the photosynthetic responses of different
tree crown levels (upper and lower); and 3) to characterize the diurnal water potential curves for these
sites to get an indication of the extent to which soil moisture supply to leaves might be limiting photo-
synthesis. The gas exchange data of the BOREAS NSA were collected to characterize diurnal gas
exchange and water potential of two canopy levels of five boreal canopy cover types: young jack pine,
old jack pine, old aspen, lowland old black spruce, and upland black spruce. These data were collected
between 27-May-1994 and 17-Sep-1994. The data are provided in tabular ASCII files.
