INDUSTRY DIRECTORY FOR ON-FARM 
BIOGAS RECOVERY SYSTEMS 
The AgSTAR Program produces this Industry 
Directory to assist livestock producers and 
others involved in the developing anaerobic 
digestion 
systems 
to 
identify 
consultants, 
designers, developers, equipment vendors, and 
other providers of biogas energy services.  
If you are in the planning stages of project 
development, we recommend that you use the 
Industry Directory in combination with the 
AgSTAR Handbook (which is available on the 
AgSTAR website at www.epa.gov/agstar) as 
project development tools to begin the initial 
project planning process to increase the 
potential for success.    
Commodity 
Organizations 
represent 
the 
interests of a specific crop or livestock 
commodity. Commodity organizations generally 
are involved in marketing or lobbying activities. 
Consultants provide a variety of services 
related to biogas recovery systems, including 
feasibility analyses (e.g., technical, economic, 
and financial), nutrient management planning, 
system design, and environmental impact and 
regulatory assessments. 
Developers design and install biogas recovery 
systems for livestock and other industries. In 
many cases, these are “turn-key” system 
developers who provide consultant services as 
part of the development package. 
Financing specialists provide loans for biogas 
projects, funding on-farm biogas systems for 
profit, and brokering the sale of carbon offsets 
and renewable energy certificates. 
Energy Service Providers are independently 
owned, municipal or co-operative electricity or 
natural gas companies that have an interest in 
providing biogas energy to customers. 
Manufacturers/distributors include entities that 
manufacture, distribute, and in some cases, 
install equipment used in biogas recovery 
systems, including covers, engines, tanks, and 
system components. 
Publishers distribute journals and reports of 
interest to farm owners and others interested in 
biogas recovery systems. 
Universities 
are 
educational 
institutions, 
including land grant colleges and universities, 
involved in developing and demonstrating on-
farm biogas recovery systems and technologies. 
The Directory is not all inclusive.  We will update 
the Directory regularly as we learn of new 
businesses in the livestock waste market. These 
updates will be posted on the AgSTAR website, 
along with other AgSTAR products. 
If you wish to be included in the Directory, go to 
http://www.epa.gov/agstar/tech/form.html. If you 
currently are on the list and want to update any 
information, go to http://www.epa.gov/agstar/

new business opportunities, and drive corporate responsibility and reputation. These services support our customers’ efforts to 
address global climate change and become carbon neutral-measures of whether an organization is green or sustainable. These 
objectives can be achieved by greening energy supplies, implementing opportunities for energy efficiency and resource 
conservation, using alternative fuels and transportation, sequestering and capturing carbon, and purchasing carbon offsets. Our 
experience in implementing these solutions has repeatedly proven that customers can reduce their carbon and environmental

ADI Systems has been involved in approximately 100 full-scale anaerobic system installations throughout the world. 
Approximately 50 of these systems treat agri-waste from food-related processing, while the remaining systems treat brewery, 
beverage, and chemical wastes. Each of these systems involves biogas collection and flaring or utilization (in most cases via 
burning in a boiler to produce hot water and steam). In several instances, utilization has involved cogeneration.

AgriClean, LLC designs and installs biogas systems in the U.S. and abroad. Although there are a number of waste treatment 
technologies in its portfolio, AgriClean is a licensee of a patented fixed-film AD system from the University of Florida.  
Examples of biogas systems include: 1) A fixed-film digester on a swine finishing farm that produces 30,000 animals per year 
(around 1600 animal units (AU) at steady-state) near Greenville, NC in partnership with the Animal and Poultry Waste 
Management Center of NC State University; 2) A fixed-film digester and biogas use system on a 400 head (around 560 AU) 
dairy in Hillsboro, MS in partnership with the Mississippi Alternative Energy Enterprise; 3) A fixed-film digester and biogas use 
system on a swine farrow-to-finish operation that produces 64,000 animals per year (around 3580 AU at steady-state) in 
Canada, and; 4) An in-ground ambient temperature earthen digester and biogas use facility on a 4000 head swine nursery farm 
in Montpelier, MS. AgriClean also acts as a project developer on numerous animal waste and food waste projects, including a 
biogas plant and piping system at a 1,000 head per day beef processing facility in Mississippi.  AgriClean has also designed a 
unique "power-flush" system (AgriJet Patent Pending) that will reduce the total amount of water used to flush the barns by close 
to 70%. This means that manure collected from barns is close to 6% solids as opposed to the 0.7% that exists today, making 
any treatment system significantly more cost-effective.

manure. Biothane worked with E3 BioFuels, LLC to develop an integrated cattle manure management/ethanol project in Mead, 
Nebraska that is expected to revolutionize ethanol production by virtually eliminating the need for fossil fuels. Biothane 
designed a nutrient recovery that separates the effluent waste stream into two separate streams, one high in solids and 
phosphorous, which is well-suited for composting, and the other low in solids and high in nitrogen, which will be sent to an 
ammonia stripping column, with aqueous ammonia as a final product.

The proposed Resource Development Associates biorefinery includes a locally managed system comprised of a 20-million 
gallon/year ethanol plant that uses local crops and an adjoining 28,000-head confined cattle feedlot connected to an anaerobic 
digester. Independent contractors will run “backgrounding“ operations with additional 13,000- to 15,000-head of cattle. The 
complex will produce fuel-grade ethanol, finished cattle, biogas, and biofertilizers. The biorefinery is economically attractive, 
with an estimated internal rate of return of approximately 30 percent, achievable through significant economies of scope. A 
commercial demonstration of this referenced biorefinery is undergoing final detailed engineering and project development at a 
site located outside of Pierre, South Dakota. Construction is scheduled to commence late spring of 2002 and start-up is 
scheduled for the summer of 2003.

LO-CAT is an H2S removal technology, where we use liquid iron redox to reduce hydrogen sulfide from gas streams (some as 
high as 99%), to pipeline specification (less than 1 ppm in some instances).  This process is safe, uses non-toxic chemistries, 
proven (we have over 170 units worldwide), and very cost-effective (LO-CAT removal of H2S generally costs between $0.10 to 
$0.15 per pound of sulfur recovered), and is probably most effective in the 500 pound per day to 20 long tons per day (of sulfur 
recovered).  We have several operating LO-CAT units in biogas environments, as well as in odor control (in similar 
environments). We do have solid media technologies in our possession (similar to iron sponge), but the economics of LO-CAT 
generally far outweigh these types of processes (in most cases). In addition to LO-CAT, we are in the final process of coming 
out with a technology called mini-CAT (which will target applications with less than 500 pounds per day of sulfur), which is 
based upon LO-CAT technology, but on a much simpler, smaller scale.  This technology will operate with the same success of 
LO-CAT, at a sulfur recovery cost of approximately $0.35 to $0.45 per pound of sulfur recovered (the higher cost is due to 
different solid sulfur filtering technologies, which makes for a "wetter" cake in mini-CAT, and therefore, a relatively higher 
chemical demand rate). This cost level is still very much less than aerobic iron sponge, which generally operates at levels of 
$1.15 to $1.25 per pound of sulfur recovered. By the way, when we talk about sulfur recovery...the sulfur that is formed in the 
LO-CAT or mini-CAT process is solid, elemental sulfur, that is very suitable as an agricultural adjunct.  We are truly a "green" 
technology, as we remove a toxin from the air, promoting the removal of a harmful greenhouse gas (methane), in a completely 
safe environment, producing a product that is very desired by the agricultural industry. In addition to sulfur removal, we have 
several other unique gas processing technologies.

In the beginning of the 1990’s, when the success story of renewable energy was still just over the horizon, Christopher Martens 
was already working hard to improve the economical efficiency of biogas plants. On his family farm in the township of Rockstedt 
in Lower Saxony, Germany, the young engineer developed innovative solutions to the early problems of biogas usage.  Out of 
this passion, MT-Energie evolved into one of the leading producers of biogas technology. In 2006, the international expansion 
of MT-Energie began. In 2007, MT-Energie broke ground on its first offices outside of Germany. Beginning in 2008, MT-Energie 
has conducted business activities in the USA. Today MT-Energie has over 240 employees, who are setting the standard both in 
and outside of Germany. Contrary to the current market trend, MT-Energie continues to grow and expand. The Northern 
German Biogas specialists increased their sales 40% to over 60 million Euros in the 2007 business year, where one in five 
biogas plants built came from MT-Energie. In order to keep up this positive growth, the company is now building new 
headquarters in Zeven, in Lower Saxony. An office building is quickly growing on a large 15 acre compound next to a modern 
logistics center, production facility and laboratory building. From the passions of a young engineer for biogas technology sprang 
an economically sound, international company.

Since 1929, Vogelsang has been a world leader, manufacturing a family of high quality, extremely dependable sludge &  
manure handling and pumping products for the world’s industrial, municipal, and agricultural markets.  
PUMPS  
With the release of the HiFlo pulsation free rotors, used exclusively in the Vogelsang positive displacement, rotary lobe pump,  
Vogelsang once again marked itself as an industry leader.  HiFlo’s unique design allows for pulsation free operation through the  
entire range of pumping.  
Additionally our pumps can pull a suction lift to 25ft (8m), run dry, pump in either direction, and feature a minimum of 25% more  
sealing lines per series, over other conventional designs.  
Coupled with Vogelsang’s uniquely designed rotary lobe pump, the combination will allow flows from 5 to 4,485 US gpm (1.1  
1,020 m3/hr), and pressures up to 232psi (16 bar).  
MACERATORS  
Our series of high performance macerators, Rota Cut, effectively reduces solids to specific size requirements, and reduces the  
costs associated with the operation of downstream equipment. Objects and debris suspended in liquid such as plastic  
fragments, rubber, hair, rags, applicators, straw, plastic pens, string, wood, bones, etc. are drawn through the cutting screen  
and shredded by the self sharpening rotary blades into an acceptable size for the downstream equipment to pass.  Optional  
cutter screen configurations provide the ability to condition solids to specific sizes, down to less than 1/4” (6mm).  
Features include auto reverse, self sharpening blades, and reusable cutter screens. Rota Cut is 100% rebuildable inline, which  
eliminates the need to send out a cutter cartridge for reconditioning.  
DIGESTER BIOMASS MIXING  
The QuickMix is a combination of a dual auger and a rotary lobe pump. The dry solids are fed into the hopper at the top and the  
augers begin to break them down while advancing the material into the mixing area. The fitting at the base of the hopper flows  
liquid sludge/manure into the bottom of the hopper where it begins to mix with the dry solids as they advance toward the pump  
end of the unit. By the time the liquid gets to the pump, it has been thoroughly mixed with the dry solids creating slurry that is of  
an ideal mixture for delivery to the digester.  QuickMix keeps the digester from being slug feed, and give an optimal mixture to  
increase overall gas production.
