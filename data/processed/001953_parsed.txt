§ 25.1521
§ 25.1511
Flap extended speed. 
The established flap extended speed 
VFE must be established so that it does 
not exceed the design flap speed VF 
chosen under §§ 25.335(e) and 25.345, for 
the corresponding flap positions and 
engine powers.
§ 25.1513
Minimum control speed. 
The minimum control speed VMC de-
termined under § 25.149 must be estab-
lished as an operating limitation.
§ 25.1515
Landing gear speeds. 
(a) The established landing gear oper-
ating speed or speeds, VLO, may not ex-
ceed the speed at which it is safe both 
to extend and to retract the landing 
gear, as determined under § 25.729 or by 
flight characteristics. If the extension 
speed is not the same as the retraction 
speed, the two speeds must be des-
ignated as VLO(EXT) and VLO(RET), re-
spectively. 
(b) The established landing gear ex-
tended speed VLE may not exceed the 
speed at which it is safe to fly with the 
landing gear secured in the fully ex-
tended position, and that determined 
under § 25.729.

§ 25.1516
Other speed limitations. 
Any other limitation associated with 
speed must be established. 
[Doc. No. 2000–8511, 66 FR 34024, June 26, 2001]
§ 25.1517
Rough air speed, VRA. 
A rough air speed, VRA, for use as the 
recommended turbulence penetration 
airspeed in § 25.1585(a)(8), must be es-
tablished, which— 
(1) Is not greater than the design air-
speed for maximum gust intensity, se-
lected for VB; and 
(2) Is not less than the minimum 
value of VB specified in § 25.335(d); and 
(3) Is sufficiently less than VMO to en-
sure that likely speed variation during 
rough air encounters will not cause the 
overspeed warning to operate too fre-
quently. In the absence of a rational 
investigation substantiating the use of 
other values, VRA must be less than 
VMO—35 knots (TAS).

§ 25.1519
Weight, center of gravity, and 
weight distribution.

ity, and weight distribution limita-
tions determined under §§ 25.23 through 
25.27 must be established as operating 
limitations.
§ 25.1521
Powerplant limitations. 
(a) General. The powerplant limita-
tions prescribed in this section must be 
established so that they do not exceed 
the corresponding limits for which the 
engines or propellers are type certifi-
cated and do not exceed the values on 
which compliance with any other re-
quirement of this part is based. 
(b) Reciprocating engine installations. 
Operating limitations relating to the 
following must be established for recip-
rocating engine installations: 
(1) Horsepower or torque, r.p.m., 
manifold pressure, and time at critical 
pressure altitude and sea level pressure 
altitude for— 
(i) Maximum continuous power (re-
lating to unsupercharged operation or 
to operation in each supercharger mode 
as applicable); and 
(ii) Takeoff power (relating to unsu-
percharged operation or to operation in 
each supercharger mode as applicable). 
(2) Fuel grade or specification. 
(3) Cylinder head and oil tempera-
tures. 
(4) Any other parameter for which a 
limitation has been established as part 
of the engine type certificate except 
that a limitation need not be estab-
lished for a parameter that cannot be 
exceeded during normal operation due 
to the design of the installation or to 
another established limitation. 
(c) Turbine engine installations. Oper-
ating limitations relating to the fol-
lowing must be established for turbine 
engine installations: 
(1) Horsepower, torque or thrust, 
r.p.m., gas temperature, and time for— 
(i) Maximum continuous power or 
thrust (relating to augmented or un-
augmented operation as applicable). 
(ii) Takeoff power or thrust (relating 
to augmented or unaugmented oper-
ation as applicable).

§ 25.1522
(2) Fuel designation or specification. 
(3) Any other parameter for which a 
limitation has been established as part 
of the engine type certificate except 
that a limitation need not be estab-
lished for a parameter that cannot be 
exceeded during normal operation due 
to the design of the installation or to 
another established limitation. 
(d) Ambient temperature. An ambient 
temperature limitation (including lim-
itations for winterization installations, 
if applicable) must be established as 
the maximum ambient atmospheric 
temperature established in accordance 
with § 25.1043(b).

§ 25.1522
Auxiliary power unit limita-
tions. 
If an auxiliary power unit is installed 
in the airplane, limitations established 
for the auxiliary power unit, including 
categories of operation, must be speci-
fied as operating limitations for the 
airplane.

§ 25.1523
Minimum flight crew. 
The minimum flight crew must be es-
tablished so that it is sufficient for safe 
operation, considering— 
(a) The workload on individual crew-
members; 
(b) The accessibility and ease of oper-
ation of necessary controls by the ap-
propriate crewmember; and 
(c) The kind of operation authorized

minations required by this section are 
set forth in appendix D.

The applicant must prepare Instruc-
tions for Continued Airworthiness in 
accordance with appendix H to this 
part that are acceptable to the Admin-
