Generic Dairy
Advertising:
How Effective?
U
SDA’s Economic Research
Service and Agricultural
Marketing Service are currently
involved in evaluating the effectiveness 
of two national programs of generic dairy
advertising.  The evaluation effort ad-
dresses three questions.  First, has generic
advertising been effective in increasing
the sales of fluid milk?  Second, has
generic advertising for cheese increased
the sales of natural and processed
cheeses?  Finally, what is the aggregate
return to dairy producers from a dollar 
of generic advertising? 
The Dairy Production Stabilization Act of
1983 (Dairy Act) established the older of
the two programs for the dairy industry.
This self-help program is funded by a
mandatory assessment for promotion,
nutrition education, and research of 15
cents per cwt on all milk produced in the
contiguous 48 states and marketed com-
mercially by dairy farmers.  The Dairy
Act allows producers to direct a maxi-
mum of 10 cents per cwt of their assess-
ment to qualified local, state, or regional 
dairy promotion campaigns.  The remain-
ing 5 cents must go to the National Dairy
Promotion and Research Board (NDB)
for national generic advertising.  NDB
focuses on generic advertising for fluid
milk and cheese.
The Fluid Milk Promotion Act of 1990
(Fluid Milk Act) established a second
dairy board, for milk processors.  This
promotion board finances its activities
through an assessment of 20 cents per
cwt on fluid milk processed and marketed
in the U.S.  All processors who market
more than 500,000 pounds of fluid milk
per month must participate.  
The goal of this national campaign is to
strengthen the dairy industry in the mar-
ketplace, to maintain and expand markets,
and to find new ways to utilize fluid milk.
Advertising under this program is strictly
for fluid milk and concentrates on print
media.  Current advertisements feature a
celebrity sporting a milk moustache and a
message informing the public about the
nutritional qualities of milk.
USDA examined the effect of generic
advertising, including the advertising
campaign of the milk processors, on fluid
milk sales in 12 milk marketing regions
(representing about 43 percent of the U.S.
population) before and after the Dairy Act
became law.  The pre-Dairy Act period
includes December 1978 through August
1984.  The post-Dairy Act period is
September 1984 through September
1995, beginning with the month when
advertising funds were first spent for fluid
milk promotion.  
Since evaluating the contributions of the
milk boards separately is impossible,
their advertising expenditures were com-
bined.  It was assumed that without the
acts, the industry would have maintained
advertising levels equivalent to 6.3 cents
per cwt of production—the advertising
rate found during the year before imple-
mentation of the Dairy Act.  Together, the
Dairy and Fluid Milk Acts accounted for
an estimated $149 million in additional
fluid milk advertising expenditures in the
12 regions from September 1984 through
September 1995 ($354 million minus an
assumed $205 million without the acts).  
For the most recent 1-year period, from
October 1994 to September 1995, fluid
milk sales in the 12 regions totaled 23.3
billion pounds, and increased advertising
expenditures due to the acts amounted to
$37.9 million.  These additional advertis-
ing expenditures increased sales by an
estimated 1 billion pounds (over 4 per-
cent of total sales).
During the 11-year post-Dairy Act period
(September 1984 through September
1995), the additional advertising expendi-
tures have contributed to an estimated
9.7-billion-pound increase (nearly 4 per-
cent of total sales) in the 12 regions’ fluid
milk sales.
Sales increases due to the Dairy and Fluid
Milk Acts stem from increases in adver-
tising dollars and their effectiveness.
However, it is possible that factors other
than advertising (e.g., increased public
concern about calcium intake levels)
might have contributed to positive
changes in consumer demand for milk
during the post-Dairy Act period. 
The effects of changes in advertising
expenditures on sales of natural and
processed cheeses were evaluated sepa-
rately because of their different product
characteristics and consumer purchasing
patterns. The analysis focused on sales of
cheese for home use, representing about a
third of the total market for cheese.  The
remaining cheese is purchased by con-
sumers for consumption away from home
(e.g., at restaurants and schools) or as
ingredients in combination foods such
as pizza.
From October 1994 to September 1995,
generic advertising increased the sale of
processed cheese by an estimated 40 mil-
lion pounds (5 percent of total sales).
Over the same period, generic advertising
increased the sale of natural cheese by an
estimated 6 million pounds (half a per-
cent of total sales).  In sum, total cheese
sales increased by an estimated 46 mil-
lion pounds (nearly 3 percent of total
sales) during this 1-year period.

Agricultural Outllook/January-February 1997                                                          Economic Research Service/USDA          33  
During the 11-year post-Dairy Act period,
advertising expenditures under the Dairy
Act increased total U.S. at-home cheese
consumption by an estimated 519 million
pounds (about 2 percent) of total cheese
sales of 21.8 billion pounds.  However,
generic advertising had different impacts
on the sales of natural and processed
cheeses.  Natural cheese sales increased
by an estimated 67 million pounds (half a
percent of total sales), while processed
cheese sales increased by 452 million
pounds (5 percent of total sales).  
Advertising’s Returns 
To Producers
A critical issue is the impact of the Dairy
and Fluid Milk Acts on the returns to a
producer’s dollar invested in generic dairy
advertising.  This is a particularly com-
plex task because of the economic link-
ages between consumers, processors, and
producers, and it involves an assumption
of how retail prices are transmitted back
to wholesale and producer prices.  In
addition, a myriad of other market factors
continues to change and to influence
decisions at each market level.  Some fac-
tors may affect one market level directly,
and another level only indirectly.  
For example, at the consumer level,
advertising effects differ for fluid milk
and cheese.  While these different effects
on products may not be of particular
interest to the producer, the combined 
effect of raw milk utilization in the indi-
vidual products does influence production
decisions.  Thus, in estimating returns to
producers from a dollar of generic adver-
tising, it was essential to allow generic
advertising to affect the retail, wholesale,
and farm levels of the milk market.
It was found that generic advertising
under the acts boosted demand for fluid
milk and cheese, but that demand for but-
ter and frozen products remained un-
changed.  Furthermore, farm-level milk
prices were higher because of the adver-
tising programs.  Farm prices averaged
over 3 percent higher than they would
have without the programs during the
September 1984-September 1995 period.  
The estimated average milk prices with
and without the acts were $12.95 and
$12.52 per cwt.  The difference between
the two prices—43 cents per cwt—is the
gross return to producers of increased
advertising under the acts.  The added
cost of advertising under the acts was 8.7
cents per cwt (calculated by subtracting
the 6.3 cents per cwt in pre-Dairy Act
advertising expenditures from the 15-
cents contribution now required from
producers).  
As a result, the gross rate of return to pro-
ducers per additional advertising dollar
was estimated at $4.90 (calculating by
dividing the added revenue per cwt due to
higher farm prices—43 cents—by the
added cost per cwt of generic advertising
associated with the acts—8.7 cents).  
The $4.90 figure may represent a maxi-
mum estimate of the rate of return at the
farm level because it assumes that the full
retail advertising effect is transmitted
back to the farm level.  However, other
researchers have estimated returns per
advertising dollar ranging from $2.50 to
$7.  These results confirm that the esti-
mated return of $4.90 per dollar of retail
advertising is within a plausible range,
and suggest that dairy farmers receive
beneficial returns from generic adver-
tising.
