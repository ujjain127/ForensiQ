U.S. Pu Disposition Program
• Estimated life cycle costs for PDCF and MFFF are
~$3.8 billion (including credits for LEU fuel
displaced by MOX fuel)
• Revised approach
−Focus on MOX/irradiation – key to bilateral agreement
with R.F.
−Sequential design and construction of major U.S.
facilities
• Proceed with MFFF design
• Followed by PDCF design
−Completes disposition mission within original timeframe
and supports U.S./R.F. agreement

The MOX Test Irradiation Is Ideal for Revealing
Any Effects of Gallium Because There Is No
Masking by Hydride-Induced Clad Damage
• Without hydrides, have only effects of fast flux
−Similar to cold-working
−Irradiated clad should withstand uniform strain of 3%–5%
• MOX test claddings
−Have no hydrides
−Prototypic integrated fast flux
−0.6 to 4.8 ppm gallium in fuel
−Clad tensile stress (in ORNL hot cells)

Concept for Ductility Testing of the MOX
Irradiation Cladding Specimens
• Compression of a polyurethane plug
fitted inside a short cladding ring
specimen
−Forces expansion similar to swelling
of fuel
−Produces essentially uniform wall
stress
• Several specimen prep/testing
simplicities
−No specimen machining
−Strain is uniform around clad ring
−Circumferential strain is simply the
diameter increase divided by the

This WG-MOX Fuel Exhibits Normal
Swelling, Densification, and Fission
Gas Release.
Important Findings:
1.
Outward clad creep due to lack of external coolant pressure.
2.
Slight difference between TIGR-treated and non-TIGR-treated MOX fuel
performances. (clad creep and FGR)
3.
Gamma scans and burnup analyses are in accordance with MCNP code
predictions. Observed fuel swelling is as expected from CARTS and
FRAPCON-3 code predictions.
4.
The gas release fraction (implied from pressure and 85Kr activity
measurements) is slightly below expectations based on the European
MOX experience.
5.
Pellet densification is prototypic of commercial MOX fuel. (~2%)
6.
Clad outward creep is about 0.015 mil per GWd/MT of burnup.
7.
No evidence of gallium migration to the clad.
8.
This test fuel prepared with weapons-derived plutonium is behaving as
expected.
