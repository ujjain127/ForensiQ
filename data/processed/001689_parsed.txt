CHANGE REQUEST 1521
SUBJECT:
Apligraf (Graftskin)
On August 12, 2000, Apligraf (Graftskin) was approved for inclusion in the United States
Pharmacopeia.  The FDA labeling for Apligraf states that the indications for its use are the treatment
of venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers.  There is no national coverage decision regarding
Apligraf.  Carriers and intermediaries have discretion regarding coverage of Apligraf.
Under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system, Apligraf is reportable with HCFA
Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code C1305.   Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)
codes describing the services delivered are reported on the bill.  The CPT codes to describe services
associated with the use of Apligraf can include 15000 for the wound site preparation and 15342 and
15343 for application of the bilaminate skin substitute.  Apligraf has been recognized as a biologic
and will be paid at 95 percent of its average wholesale price (AWP) effective January 1, 2001.
Code Q0185 should be used for Apligraf for claims submitted to the carriers.  CPT codes 15000,
15342, and 15343 can be used to describe the services delivered when Apligraf is used.  For these
services, physicians should not bill Apligraf using HCPCS code C1305 since this code has been
approved solely for use under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.  The payment
mechanism for Q0185 is 95 percent of its AWP since Apligraf has met the statutory requirement as
a biologic.
The effective date for this Program Memorandum (PM) is February 7, 2001.
The implementation date for this PM is February 7, 2001.
These instructions should be implemented within your current operating budget.
