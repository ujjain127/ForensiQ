XEmacs (but not Emacs) has this nice feature that if you have a session of XEmacs running and you break the X connection (e.g. your x server goes down), XEmacs immediately starts taking all the CPU available.<p>
Here's a list of suggestions:
<ol>
<li> Have people switch to Emacs instead of XEmacs (same functionality; doesn't have ****** bar of icons).  This would mean that they would need to install emacs on all the b0 machines (its installed on at least dap30, dap61, and dap72)
<li> Make sure users know to check that XEmacs has really exited when they've stopped (with either 'ps' or 'top').
<li> We can write a perl script that looks for runaway emacs jobs and take appropriate action (i.e. send email to the user, renice the job, and eventually kill the job).  The problem of course is telling the difference between legit emacs sessions that happen to be temporarily using all available CPU (e.g. reformatting a large file) and a run away job.
</ol>

I've ordered the suggestions in the order I'd use them, but I realize that not every body going to agree with me on this one :-)

Mail sent to Burkard Reisert <reisert@fnal.gov>, Vadim Rusu <vrusu@fnal.gov>, and Frans Marjamaa <marjamaa@fnal.gov> asking them to check each of their xemacs and kill it if it's useless

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 11;31;20 comment by...Frank Chlebana -->
<pre>dap72 is one of the general purpose machines used as a gateway
and for user code development. It is not essential for datataking.

We will add a watchdog that will sent mail to the user when a
runaway process is identified.

dap85 has been replaced by dap86

Will look into the other monitoring problems... they do
not appear critical.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 19;46;55 comment by...Sergei -->
--- b0dap72 is general use computer. User Marjamaa should be asked to stop runaway emacs
--- b0dap10 is behind a router firewall, BB checks only connection
(it's up or down).
-- b0dap85 is unused right now (Acnet was moved to b0dap86), there is a plan to re-installed b0dap85.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 20;04;42 comment by...Sergei -->
The current Xemacs problem is/was on b0dap72 . Emacs is installed on b0dap72, But the users (marjamaa, vrusu and reisert) still prefer to use Xemacs. Maybe Xemacs should be removed from the important Online computers and replaced by Emacs?

<p>While setting (3) channels on PISABOX back to nominal (worst was off 2 V), found that Global Alarm display showed PSM as red. 
On further investigation, found that PISABOX did not see VOLTMAN 
in Network Status display.  Usually, it showed error "Not found 
in HOSTS file", but momentarily would show "Dynamic iFIX  
connection" only to fail again.  Will look at this with Mark 
tomorrow.</p>

<pre>As I remember, we've had this problem with PSM since we moved to current version of iFix (same thing with my office desktop).

<p>Response on VNODE2 was VERY slow.  Killed running Internet 
Explorer, only to find two more rogue IE processes (IEXPLORE.EXE) 
in the Task Manager.  Killed first, and all icons and taskbar  
disappeared.  Killed second, and only Intellution Workspace still 
responded, and top screen went blank.  Tried to log in to iFIX 
with my account, so I could kill iFIX, but could not.  Had to 
reboot with power button on computer.</p> 
 
<p>Took a long time to come back, but now seems to be running 
much faster.  I would recommend NEVER killing Internet Explorer 
so as to avoid these rogue processes.</p>

<pre>Brief warning state for L00 in global alarms - cleared up before I had a chance to see what caused it.</pre>
<!-- Author: Else -->
<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 09;06;44 comment by...Else -->
Happened again twice - the warning concerns PT-COTL00E (east pressure at COT face).



<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 09;42;00 comment by...Else -->
Again.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 10;00;11 comment by...Else -->
Again. Silicon ooling pager carrier (Mircea) is looking at it. This time the pressure was 13.2, nominal is 13.0.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 10;13;07 comment by...Sunil Somalwar -->
Mircea coming in to look at the history and decide if there is a problem or it is just a fluke.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul  5 10;29;22 comment by...Else -->
I have stopped reporting the warning incidents as it comes back on a regular basis. (probably a lot more than I notice).

Here is some info on the power strip that failed in L3 rack.<br> 
<ul> 
<li>Power strips are APC model number AP9221 units 
<li>Main controller is APC Master Switch VM Controller 
<li>Each power strip has a LED with status: 
 <ul> 
 <li>OFF: no power 
 <li>GREEN: strip operating at acceptable load 
 <li>FLASHING GREEN: strip operating close to load limit 
 <li>RED: strip operating at overload 
 </ul> 
</ul> 
We have 16 of these power strips and most are in "flashing 
green" mode. One has a RED led and one has failed. Clearly 
this system needs some attention.

Following the PT-COTL00E (east pressure at COT face) warnings:
I discovered that this warnings were around from May 21, 2004, but they are too quick to react. The problem seems to point to some change in the running conditions after the "lost cooling water" <a href="http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2004&action=copyentry&page=348&time=15:41:44.828"> see entry </a>. The SVX supply temperature on East side went up by about 4 degrees, and triggered an increase in pressure at the face of the COT(PT_COTBHE1 and PT_COTL00E), as can be seen in the plots above.
To cope with this new conditions I lowered the flow a bit on the L00E line (45% -> 40%). 
<br>
Dear Aces, if there is any warning, please, page me!
