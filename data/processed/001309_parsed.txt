How ecosystems adapt to climate changes depends in part on how individual trees allocate resources to their
components. A review of research using tree seedlings provides some support for the hypothesis that some tree
species respond to exposure to drought with increases in root:shoot ratios but little change in total root
biomass. Limited research on mature trees over moderately long time periods (2–10 yr), has given mixed results
with some studies also providing evidence for increases in root:shoot ratios. The Throughfall Displacement
Experiment (TDE) was designed to simulate both an increase and a decrease of 33% in water inputs to a mature
deciduous forest over a number of years. Belowground research on TDE was designed to examine four hypo-
thesized responses to long-term decreases in water availability; (1) increases in ﬁne-root biomass, (2) increases in ﬁne
root:foliage ratio, (3) altered rates of ﬁne-root turnover (FRT), and (4) depth of rooting. Minirhizotron root
elongation data from 1994 to 1998 were examined to evaluate the ﬁrst three hypotheses. Diﬀerences across
treatments in net ﬁne-root production (using minirhizotron root elongation observations as indices of biomass
production) were small and not signiﬁcant. Periods of lower root production in the dry treatment were
compensated for by higher growth during favorable periods. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, both the highest
production (20 to 60% higher) and mortality (18 to 34 % higher) rates were found in the wet treatment, resulting
in the highest index of FRT. After 5 yr, a clear picture of stand ﬁne-root-system response to drought exposure
has yet to emerge in this forest ecosystem. Our results provide little support for either an increase in net ﬁne-root
production or a shift towards an increasing root:shoot ratio with long-term drought exposure. One possible
explanation for higher FRT rates in the wet treatment could be a positive relationship between FRT and nitrogen
and other nutrient availability, as treatments have apparently resulted in increased immobilization of nutrients in
the forest ﬂoor litter under drier conditions. Such hypotheses point to the continued need to study the interactions
of water stress, nutrient availability and carbon-ﬁxation eﬃciency in future long-term studies.
Key words: global climate, drought, root growth, ﬁne-root turnover (FRT), root mortality, upland oaks, carbon

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) concluded that climate has changed over the
past century and is expected to continue to change
(Houghton et al., 1996). Increases in the levels of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are predicted to

leading to increased winter precipitation at high
latitudes, with more hot days and fewer cold days
(Rind et al., 1990; Kattenberg et al., 1996). The
response of forests to decreased water availability is
considered to be a key issue in climate change
scenarios (Wigley et al., 1984). Concerns regarding
eﬀects on vegetation have been ampliﬁed because
rates of change are expected to occur more rapidly
than past successional processes and species dispersal
rates (Solomon, 1986; Pastor & Post, 1988; Davis,
1989; Overpeck et al., 1991).
The ability of ecosystems – and individual com-
ponents thereof – to survive and adapt to changes in
climate will depend in part on how individual trees

allocate resources to their various plant components.
Aboveground forest productivity will certainly de-
pend in part on the allocation of carbon (C)
belowground. The way in which plants balance
resources between photosynthetic organs, support-
ing stems and branches, reproductive organs and
root systems is a complex process that plant
physiologists have long been struggling to under-
stand. It has been well documented that tree species
adapted to dry climatic regimes generally have higher
root:shoot ratios (R:S) and deeper root systems than
species that are more suited to mesic climatic regimes
(van Buijtenen et al., 1976; Caldwell & Richards,
1986; Bongarten & Teskey, 1987; Pallardy &
Rhoads, 1993). Kozlowski et al. (1991) list 10
references that document the successful avoidance of
water stress by some deep-rooted tree species able to
use subsurface sources of water.
Such evidence has probably contributed to the
general concept that trees frequently respond to dry
conditions by altering R:S ratios and by increasing
rooting depth (Kozlowski et al., 1991). Several
hypotheses have arisen from this general concept
concerning the eﬀects of long-term decreases in
water availability: (1) increases in ﬁne-root biomass,
root length density and gross and net root elongation;
(2) increases in R:S, especially the ﬁne-root biomass
:foliar biomass ratio; (3) altered rates of FRT; (4)
increased depth of rooting and}or density of ﬁne
roots at greater depths.
The ﬁrst objective of this manuscript is to review
evidence in the literature that pertains to these
hypotheses with regard to tree species. The second
objective is to present results from one long-term
study that pertains to hypotheses 1–3.
What scientiﬁc evidence exists that indicates that
exposure to increasingly dry moisture regimes results
in trees allocating a higher percentage of their
resources to their root systems? At least one gradient
study indicates that, within a single tree species, the
ratio of ﬁne-root biomass:aboveground biomass is
considerably greater under xeric conditions than
under mesic conditions (Comeau & Kimmins, 1989).
Another such gradient study, however, found no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in living ﬁne-root biomass
across three sites exhibiting a natural gradient of soil
water availability (Santantonio & Hermann, 1985).
In fact, in this study, living ﬁne-root biomass was
lowest at the driest site, whereas FRT rates were
highest at this site.
It is quite well established that tree root elongation
declines as soil water potential decreases across the
range ®0.3 to ®1.2 MPa and that it virtually ceases
close to or before the latter point (Larson, 1980;
Teskey & Hinckley, 1981; Kuhns et al., 1985;
Torreano & Morris, 1998; J. D. Joslin et al.,
unpublished). But what impact does exposure to
water stress have on ﬁne-root growth in portions of
the rooting zone that are less dry or during
subsequent periods when soil is rewetted? Several
studies indicate that, when trees experience moisture
stress in one part of the rooting zone, root growth
increases in areas where water is still available,
usually at greater depths (Dickman et al., 1996;
Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1996; Torreano & Morris,
1998; Table 1). Osunubi & Davies (1981) found this
to be the case for seedlings of a deep-rooted tree
species (English oak, Quercus robur), but not for a
shallow-rooted species (silver birch, Betula pendula).
In irrigation studies, prior exposure to water stress
has yielded various plant responses. In Bongarten &
Teskey (1987), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) seedlings
previously exposed to drought developed higher
R:S ratios than nonexposed seedlings (Table 1).
Tomlinson & Anderson (1998) found that, in
northern red oak (Quercus rubra) seedlings subjected
to moderate water stress, the sink strength of the
belowground plant parts increased. By contrast,
Pallardy & Rhoads (1993) reported that prior
exposure to drought had no eﬀect on the subsequent
root growth of seedlings of four diﬀerent tree species.
Similarly, Torreano & Morris (1998) found reduced
root growth and no change in R:S ratios in loblolly
pine seedlings receiving the lowest level of irrigation.
Gower et al. (1992) found that the percentage of
net primary productivity (NPP) allocated below-
ground over a 2-yr period was signiﬁcantly higher in

stands than in irrigated stands (Table 2). Similarly,
R:S ratios were more than two-fold higher in a
nonirrigated rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plan-
tation than in an irrigated one, after 10 yr of dry
season irrigation (Devakumar et al., 1999). Further
support for R:S shifts comes from long-term
irrigation studies on coniferous forests as part of the
EXMAN
(Experimental
manipulation
of
forest
ecoystems) project in Europe (Devisser et al., 1994).
In three of these studies, irrigation treatments over
3–4 yr diminished net root production relative to
nonirrigated treatments, while irrigation increased
aboveground
biomass
production.
By
contrast,
Bredemeier et al. (1998) observed no eﬀect of prior
artiﬁcial exposure to drought on subsequent Norway
spruce (Picea abies) stand root production.
For predictions of the long-term response of
forests
to
climate
changes,
all
of
the
studies
mentioned are limited when extrapolating results to
mature deciduous forests. Gradient studies are
subject to confounding by genetic diﬀerences in the
trees growing at the various sites, as well as other
uncontrolled site diﬀerences. The extrapolation of
results from short-term studies on seedlings under
artiﬁcial conditions to long-term eﬀects on ‘natural’,
mature forests, obviously requires considerable cau-
tion. Even stand-irrigation results are often based on
relatively short-term responses.
Our conﬁdence in predicting forest responses to
climate change are greatly limited by the lack of
long-term
ecosystem-level
studies.
Practical
limitations are obvious barriers to such research.
Such studies as, the EXMAN Project, where inputs
of water and nutrients were controlled in ﬁve stands
for 3 or 4 yr (Beier & Rasmussen, 1993; Devisser et
al., 1994), the long-term irrigation research of
Devakumar et al. (1999) on rubber tree plantations
and the research of Gower et al. (1992), have begun
to shed light on the eﬀects of varying the supply of
water on forest growth responses, above and below-
ground (Table 2). Even in the context of global
climate change, the 2–4-yr length of the Gower et al.
(1992) and Devisser et al. (1994) studies might be
considered relatively short-term!
These long-term studies were conducted on
conifer forests of the western USA or on tropical
evergreen species. Root-growth strategies for co-
niferous tree species are often quite distinct from
those for deciduous angiosperms tree species (Bauhs
& Messier, 1999). The oak–hickory and northern
hardwood forests of the north temperate zone have
been identiﬁed as sensitive plant communities that
are likely to show early responses to climate change.
The upland oak-dominated forest found on the
Walker Branch Watershed (Oak Ridge, TN, USA) is
a good example of one of these critical and com-
mercially valuable vegetation zones. The Through-
fall Displacement Experiment (TDE) on this water-
shed has the speciﬁc goals of looking at the long-term
eﬀects of both decreasing and increasing water inputs
to the forest ﬂoor on a mature deciduous forest in the
warm temperate zone. This 1.92-ha ﬁeld manipu-
lation experiment is examining both aboveground
and belowground changes, looking not only at
alterations in tree growth, mortality and C allocation,
but also at the morphological and physiological
mechanisms behind such changes.
Belowground research as part of the TDE is
focused on the four hypotheses mentioned pre-
viously, by comparing ﬁne-root responses across the
three treatments. To date, data from minirhizotrons,
root coring, soil pits and root ingrowth cores have
been collected over a 5-yr period. Net changes in
absolute values for ﬁne-root biomass, root length
density, root:shoot ratios and root distribution will
not be available until repeated coring and excavation
are carried out after the ﬁfth year. However, in the
meantime, 5 yr of minirhizotron observations on

root elongation across the treatments are being used
as indicators of the treatment eﬀects on ﬁne-root
production, ratios of ﬁne-root production:foliar
production and FRT rates. This paper presents
results from this extensive period of minirhizotron
data collection and relate them to three of the four
hypotheses introduced earlier – alterations in (1) root
production, both gross and net, (2) root:shoot ratios
and (3) rates of FRT. Evidence pertaining to
hypothesis 4 (changes in rooting depth) is currently
lacking. The results presented will be restricted to
root elongation occurring in the area of greatest
treatment eﬀect (as evidenced by the monitoring of
soil water potential) and of greatest rooting density,
that is the upper 30 cm of the soil proﬁle on the
upper slope of the experimental plots. Greater root
response variability in minirhizotron observations,
coupled with smaller treatment diﬀerences in both
soil water potentials and ﬁne-root responses at lower
depths, make the results from the upper 30 cm the
most interesting.

Study site
All the belowground research reported here was
conducted as part of the TDE, which is located on
the
Walker
Branch
Watershed
in
Oak
Ridge,
Tennessee, USA. At the beginning of the study, the
overstory of the site was dominated by chestnut oak
(Quercus prinus L.), white oak (Quercus alba L.),
black gum (Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.) and red maple
(Acer rubrum L.) (Table 3). The understory was
dominated by red maple, dogwood (Cornus ﬂorida
L.) and black gum with 29, 19 and 14% of sapling
basal area, respectively. Initial stand basal area
averaged 21 m# ha−", with each treatment plot nearly
identical. Mean leaf area index averaged 6.3 m# m−#
over the ﬁrst 4 yr of the study. The study site lies on
a southeast-facing slope with uniform residual soils
that are cherty, infertile and permeable. The soils are
classiﬁed as Typic Paleudults by the US system of
soil classiﬁcation. Soil water content at ﬁeld capacity

ranges from 22% to 36%, depending on horizon. At
‘wilting point’ (®1.5 MPa), soil water contents
varied between 8–12% (Hanson et al., 1995, 1998).
Mean annual precipitation is 1358 mm and mean
temperature is 14.1°C. Soil temperature at 10-cm
depth regularly ﬂuctuates from an average low of
1°C in January to a high of 26°C in July–August;
lows during the growing season occur in early April
and average 9°C. Further details on the TDE site,
climate, soils and vegetation are available in Hanson
et al. (1995, 1998).
The TDE experimental system is designed to
maintain multi-year changes in soil water potential
similar to those which might occur as a result of
global climate change. Treatments simulate both a
33% increase (wet treatment) and a 33% decrease
(dry treatment) in water inputs, relative to control
(ambient treatment). The reduction of throughfall
by 33% was used because the soil water reductions
expected would be similar to that experienced during
a 1980’s drought in the southeastern USA (Cook et
al., 1988), that resulted in increased mortality of tree
saplings and reduced growth of vegetation (Jones et
al., 1993). These treatments were generated by
passively collecting and diverting 33% of throughfall
from the dry plot to the wet plot through a system of
trough-like collectors and pipes. The wet, dry and
ambient treatments each encompass an area of 0.64
ha (80¬80 m). No statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in soil temperature were observed among treatments.
Additional details on daily climate and the ex-
perimental design and performance of the TDE
system are available in Hanson et al. (1995, 1998).
Minirhizotrons
Minirhizotron tubes (30) were installed in the TDE
site between February and March 1994. In each of
the three TDE treatment plots, 10 tubes were
installed, ﬁve along the upper slope (at approx.
340 m elevation) and ﬁve along the lower slope (at
approx. 330 m elevation). The tubes were installed
pointing upslope at a 45° angle to the slope to a
vertical depth of 90 cm; however, because of the
RESEARCH
Water eﬀects on forest root systems
121
high rock content, the maximum depth achieved
for most tubes was between 60 and 90 cm. The
minirhizotron tubes (5.7 cm in diameter and 130 cm
long) were etched with a single set of 130 equally
spaced grids (Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1992). Only
data from the upper 30 cm of the soil proﬁles on the
upper slope tubes are presented in this paper.
Video imaging of roots, using a Circon color
agricultural camera (Circon Inc., Santa Barbara,
CA, USA), was conducted during the growing
seasons 1994–98. In each year, imaging began in
April before bud break and continued biweekly
throughout October, with all root activity on the
etched face of the tube recorded along with depth
information. With the exception of 1995, 13–15
observation periods were recorded each year. Video
images were digitized using PC based MSU-
ROOTS software (Michigan State University In-
structional Media Center; Enslin et al., 1994) to
measure root length production and to track the
changes in the condition of ﬁne roots over the
duration of the study. All roots were categorized as
new since the last sampling date, previously existing
and still alive, dead, or missing. If a root became
‘missing’ before being categorized as dead, and did
not reappear at a future photographic session, it was
considered dead from the time of disappearance.
Fine-root production and mortality measurements
were made as described by Hendrick & Pregitzer
(1993). Such minirhizotron measurements of ﬁne-
root elongation and mortality do not provide direct
measurements of total ﬁne-root-biomass production
or mortality; however, they do serve as excellent
indices of such production and mortality across
treatments. Root production (elongation) for a given
time interval was considered to be the length of new
roots in each set of ﬁve minirhizotrons per plot,
present on a given sample date, that were not present
on the previous sample date. Further details on
minirhizotron installation and data collection can be
found in Joslin & Wolfe (1998, 1999).
Fine-root turnover
Fine-root turnover refers to the process by which
roots are produced, die and decompose. It has been
deﬁned as the ratio of annual ﬁne-root production to
either the maximum or minimum belowground
standing crop of ﬁne roots (Dahlman & Kucera,
1965; Gill & Jackson, 2000). Although this ratio
provides an index of the rate at which new roots are
being produced to replace those which are dying, we
prefer a deﬁnition that acknowledges that the rate of
turnover is really the average rate for all three
processes involved – production, mortality and
decomposition (Joslin & Henderson, 1982, 1987;
Santantonio & Hermann, 1985). While it is com-
monly assumed that ecosystems are near equilibrium
with regard to the rates of these three processes, so
that there is no net long-term change in the biomass
of roots over time, this is clearly not the case in some
ecosystems, particularly aggrading ones, or for
certain time intervals. Hence, while the ratio of one
of these processes, such as root production, to the
standing crop is sometimes used as an index of
turnover rate, the ideal measure would be one that
employs the average of all three rates. Here we use
the sum of root elongation (an index of production)
and of root mortality as an index of turnover rate,
since we
have
no
data
for this
site
on
root
decomposition rate, and since the initial standing
ﬁne-root biomass did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly across
treatment plots or slope position (Joslin & Wolfe,
1999). It should be noted that because minirhizotron
elongation and mortality measurements cannot be
accurately converted into root biomass production
estimates (e.g. in units of kg ha−" yr−"), these
measurements cannot provide absolute turnover
ﬁgures. Instead these measures are used as an index
of FRT, for comparison purposes across treatments.
Soil water measurements
Soil water content was measured across the entire
study area using an 8¬8-m grid system of time
domain reﬂectometers (TDR; Soil Moisture Equip-
ment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA: Hanson et
al., 1998). Soil-water measurements were conducted
biweekly during the growing season and monthly
during the dormant season, beginning in August
1992. Raw volumetric soil-water-content data from
TDR measurements were corrected for mean coarse
fraction of soil at a given location (Hanson et al.,
1998). Soil-water-content measurements were con-
verted to soil water potential using soil water
retention
curves
developed
from
representative
samples from the A, AE and EB horizons. Curves
were developed from gravimetric measurements of
soil water content and psychrometric measures of
soil water potential. Thermocouple psychrometers
(SC-10,
Decagon
Devices,
Inc.,
Pullman,
Washington, DC, USA) were calibrated with a
graded series of NaCl solutions before each use and
these soil temperature readings were used in the
conversion of TDR measurements into soil-water-
potential values. Soil-water-potential conversions
using the retention curve for the AE horizon were
used for the 0–35 cm depth interval, as this horizon
occupied 75% of the upper 35 cm of the proﬁle and
was considered most representative of this depth
interval.

intersections of each of the three treatment blocks of

throughout each of the 5 yr (typically mid-May, late-
Aug, and biweekly during the period 1 Oct–1 Dec of
each year). Litter samples were oven-dried at 70°C,
sorted into foliar and nonfoliar components and the
total mass determined. Litter production was then
converted to a ground area (g m−#) basis.
Statistical analyses and data presentation
For the purposes of data presentation and statistical
analysis, the primary experimental unit used was the
summed response for each individual minirhizotron
tube, across the appropriate depth and time interval.
Since this study focuses on the upper 30 cm of the
soil proﬁles on the upper slope, summed data from
each of these tubes on root production, root mortality
and net root production were analyzed. Thus,
whether annual or 5-yr comparisons between treat-
ments are being presented, they are based on
summed data from ﬁve minirhizotron tubes per
treatment. Statistical comparisons are restricted to
annual
and
5-yr
treatment
diﬀerences.
Mini-
rhizotron data were collected almost entirely during
the growing season (Apr–Oct) as already mentioned.
During the summer of 1996, video equipment failure
occurred in late June which resulted in a ‘data gap’
for the remainder of that growing season; conse-
quently no data are available from this period. As
most of this period of missing data corresponded
with the most severe drought of the research period
(Fig. 1) and our data indicate minimal root growth
occurring below –0.6 MPa water potential, we
believe that very little root growth occurred in any of
the treatments during the majority of this period.
Mortality certainly occurred during this time, but
we obviously have no data to report. The 5-yr totals
for ﬁne-root production and mortality do not include
data from this period nor from any winter period.
Checks for the occurrence of winter period root
elongation, from January and March 1998 mini-
rhizotron measurements, revealed that this winter
period accounted for !5% of the annual total.
Data collected during the ﬁrst year (1994), im-
mediately
following
minirhizotron
installation,
strongly suggest that excessive root proliferation
occurred during this year as a result of root pruning
eﬀects and soil disturbance impacts on nutrient
availability (Fig. 1). This eﬀect and its probable
causes have been thoroughly described in Joslin &
Wolfe (1999). Whereas the magnitude of mini-
rhizotron measures of root growth appears to have
been ampliﬁed during this period, there is no
evidence for any treatment-related biases. The data
from this ﬁrst year appear to correctly reﬂect, across
the three treatments, the phenology of ﬁne-root
production and mortality, as well as the relative
quantity of organic matter involved in these pro-
cesses. Hence raw data from this ﬁrst year are
presented and analyzed along with data from the
subsequent 4 yr.
Statistical tests for the main eﬀects of treatment on
an annual basis were conducted for each year using
analysis of estimated coeﬃcients based on response
curves (Gurevitch & Chester, 1986; Meredith &
Stehman, 1991). Polynomial response functions were
ﬁtted to 13 repeated measures of each experimental
unit using orthogonal contrasts. The estimated
coeﬃcients of these functions were then treated as
primary
data
and
analyzed
using
univariate
ANOVA, with the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS
Institute, 1989). Statistical tests for diﬀerences
between treatments for the entire 5-yr period were
conducted using univariate ANOVA on summed
data across the appropriate tubes within a treatment
and the appropriate depth interval. ANCOVA was
applied to annual stand foliar production values,
using the 1993 data as the covariate. Main eﬀects of
year and treatment were evaluated with signiﬁcance
determined from P-values !0.10.

Patterns of ﬁne-root production and mortality over
ﬁve years
Fig. 1 juxtaposes ﬂuctuations in soil water potential
and ﬁne-root elongation at biweekly intervals across
the 5 yr of minirhizotron observation. As already
discussed in the Materials and Methods section and
in Joslin & Wolfe (1999), the magnitude of all
responses during the ﬁrst year (1994) are ampliﬁed
across all three treatments. One trend that is
apparent in several growing seasons (predominantly
1994, 1996 and 1998) is that early summer growth
tends to last longer in the wet treatment than the
ambient or dry, and that mid-summer growth spurts
are more likely in the wet treatment. Whereas
diﬀerences in soil water potential are small between
treatments, soil drying generally occurs sooner and is
more severe in the dry and ambient treatments.
Previous studies with white oak indicate that root
elongation rate begins to decline markedly at soil
water potentials between ®0.4 and ®0.8 MPa and
virtually ceases at c. ®1.2 MPa (Larson & Whitmore,
1970; Teskey & Hinckley, 1981; Kuhns et al., 1985).
Our results with this mix of upland hardwood
species generally agree with this conclusion (Fig. 1;
J. D. Joslin et al., unpublished). It is noteworthy that
root elongation rate diﬀerences among treatments
often begin to occur as soil water potentials reach
®0.5 MPa in the dry treatment before the other
treatments. Also few diﬀerences occur among treat-
ments in late August, September or October, as a lull
in root growth in these upland hardwood species
seems to occur at this time of year regardless of
moisture conditions (Teskey & Hinckley, 1981;

spatially and temporally variable parameter such as
root growth, and with our relatively small number of
minirhizotron tubes. Despite periods of drought
during 1995 and 1998, ﬁne-root production was
apparently able to compensate with suﬃcient growth
during more favorable periods.
Five-year totals of ﬁne-root production, mortality
and turnover
Fig. 4 depicts the summation, across all 5 yr, of gross
ﬁne-root production, ﬁne-root mortality and net
ﬁne-root production (the diﬀerence between the ﬁrst
two values). Whereas diﬀerences are small in gross
root production, the highest rate was found in the
wet treatment, closely followed by the dry treatment.
Although treatment diﬀerences were not signiﬁcant,
the highest mortality was also found in the wet
treatment; in fact, mortality was 20% and 60%
higher in the wet treatment than in the dry and
ambient treatments, respectively. This combination
of higher mortality and higher production rates in
the wet treatment resulted in comparable amounts of
net root production across the three treatments.
Mortality in all treatments occurred at a relatively
steady rate throughout each growing season, with no
apparent relationship to soil water potential or soil
temperature.

J. D. Joslin et al.
Using the average of root production and root
mortality as an index of root turnover (as described
in the Materials and Methods section) the com-
bination of higher root production and higher
mortality in the wet treatment resulted in indices of
FRT that were 18% and 34% higher than in the dry
and ambient treatments, respectively (Table 4).
Treatment diﬀerences again were not statistically
signiﬁcant. The high rate of FRT in the wet
treatment coincides with the fact that this treatment
also had the highest rate of leaf litter decomposition
(Todd & Hanson, 1999).
Foliar production and ﬁne root: foliage ratio
Annual stand-level foliar biomass production (as
indexed by litterfall) has not been signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by either the throughfall treatments during
any of the 5 yr or by interannual diﬀerences in
weather. Annual production of aboveground litterfall
at the stand level (Fig. 5) has been nearly constant at
approx. 500 g m−# yr−". Whereas the annual in-
crement of coarse root, bole and tree branch
production (i.e. woody increment) has not been
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the TDE treatments to date,
statistically
signiﬁcant
(P
!0.05)
inter-annual
diﬀerences in wood production have been observed
(Hanson et al., 1998; P. J. Hanson & D. E. Todd,
pers. comm.). Because there have been no stat-
istically signiﬁcant eﬀects of the water regime
treatments on either foliar biomass (Fig. 5) or on the
long-term net increment in ﬁne-root biomass (as
indexed by net root elongation measures in mini-
rhizotrons; Fig. 4), we cannot conclude from these
data that there has been any signiﬁcant treatment
eﬀect on ﬁne root : foliage ratio over this 5-yr period.

One of the most interesting ﬁndings from these
observation of root elongation over 5 yr, is the
apparent resilience of this forest ecosystem in
ostensibly maintaining a relatively constant ﬁne root
mass over the long-term (i.e. net root length
production is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero for
any treatment), despite seeming short-term declines
during certain periods, particularly in the dry
treatment. This resilience, most evident in the dry
treatment, is dependent on the ability of the stand to
respond opportunistically with spurts of root growth
during periods of high soil moisture and moderate
temperature. The results of our research indicate
that, in this ecosystem, the major pulse of root
elongation is apparently genetically programmed to
occur in late spring and early summer, a pattern
similar to that in many deciduous forests in much of
the temperate zone (Joslin, 1983; Hendrick &
Pregitzer, 1996; J. D. Joslin et al., unpublished). At
the same time, they also seem to indicate that root
growth can be increased, in an apparent compensa-
tory response, following periods of net reduction in
ﬁne-root biomass.
After 5 yr, these results do not give a clear picture
of root system response to drought exposure in this
forest ecosystem. Net ﬁne-root growth was signiﬁ-
cantly higher (P !0.10) during 1996 in the dry
treatment, a response that could be interpreted as a
whole-stand adaptation to the reduced water inputs
and higher water stress experienced during the
previous 2 yr (Joslin & Wolfe, 1998). Conversely,
this response could be interpreted as simply an
‘equilibration response’, with the dry stand restoring
its previous level of ﬁne-root biomass.
The absence of either higher net ﬁne-root pro-
duction or higher R:S ratios in the dry treatment
compared with other treatments is not consistent
with some of the literature (Tables 1, 2). As noted
previously, several studies on seedlings (Osunubi &
Davies, 1981, English oak; Bongarten & Teskey,
1987; Tomlinson & Anderson, 1998) support the
concept of a shift towards increased ﬁne-root growth
with increasing drought exposure. Similarly, at least
three long-term irrigation studies on plantations or
forests provide support for root responses of a
similar nature and}or a shift in R:S ratio (Gower et
al., 1992; Devisser et al., 1994; Devakumar et al.,
1999). The results of Devakumar et al. (1999),
showing a decrease in R:S ratio with irrigation, are
particularly convincing evidence for the particular
species studied, since the study was conducted over
a 10-yr period. However, the results of certain
experiments
with
contrasting
results
indicate,
perhaps, that such a response may be highly species-
speciﬁc (Osunubi & Davies, 1981; Pallardy &
Rhoads, 1993).
In our study, the possibility that root systems are
tapping supplies of water deep in the soil proﬁle
during
dry
periods
has
not
been
eliminated.
Although a very high bulk density (bulk density ¯
approx. 1.75 g cm−$) argillic horizon appears to
restrict root growth to the upper 90 cm, there
remains
the
possibility
that
some
roots
have
penetrated this barrier. The lack of strong or highly
signiﬁcant responses to the water treatments might,
in part, be a result of reduced treatment eﬀects
caused by this phenomenon. This question is
currently being investigated. A second reason for the
lack of statistically signiﬁcant results is the relatively
high variability in growth rates observed between
minirhizotrons, coupled with the relatively low
number of tubes (n ¯ 5) per treatment, and slope
position. Such reductions in statistical power are
largely the result of the high labor requirements of
measuring root growth and the natural variability in
root distribution and responses; two factors that
have consistently plagued root research since its
inception. The Devisser et al. (1994) study closely
examined ﬁne-root biomass responses at three of ﬁve

sites. Whereas more available water resulted in lower
ﬁne-root biomass relative to the drier treatment
(control), the diﬀerences were rather small and not
statistically
signiﬁcant.
Positive
aboveground
responses to irrigation in their study, however,
resulted in a decrease in R:S ratio with increasing
water availability. Our results, however, lend little
support, at least at this site across this range of water
stress, to the hypothesis of a shift towards an increase
in the ﬁne-root biomass:foliar biomass ratio with
increasing drought exposure.
The results of our study indicate a higher index of
FRT in the wet treatment than in the ambient and
dry
treatments
(Table
4).
Again
treatment
diﬀerences were not statistically diﬀerent. The wet
treatment had the highest gross ﬁne-root production
over 5 yr of treatment; it also had the highest ﬁne-
root mortality rate. In a review on root turnover, Gill
& Jackson (2000) found that globally there was a
positive correlation between mean annual precipita-
tion and FRT (r ¯­0.57), but that the relation-
ship was not statistically signiﬁcant. By contrast,
Ewel & Gholz (1991) predicted no change in
FRT with decreasing moisture availability in slash
pine (Pinus elliottii) stands. Similarly, Santantonio &
Hermann (1985) and Pregitzer et al. (1993) found
greater average ﬁne-root longevity (i.e. lower turn-
over rates) under moist conditions than under dry
conditions.
These conﬂicting results can perhaps be explained
by the diﬀerent experimental designs and conditions.
The Santantonio & Hermann (1985) experiment
deals with a water availability gradient across three
Douglas-ﬁr-dominated stands. Genetic diﬀerences
in the Douglas-ﬁr stock are certain to have occurred
at these three separate sites where tree species have
had millenia to adapt genetically to site conditions.
Such a genetically evolved diﬀerence in tree root-
growth pattern is clearly diﬀerent from a short-term
adaptive response of an existing stand to a changing
water regime. The Pregitzer et al. (1993) study, by
contrast, examined the rate of FRT in isolated
irrigated microsites within a stand over a relatively
short time period. In such a study, root longevity in
a small part of a root system exposed to portions of
the soil environment with unique characteristics, is
likely to be quite diﬀerent from the response of an
entire root system to changes introduced uniformly
across the stand and its soil proﬁle over a long time
span.
Fine-root mortality, across 5 yr of our study
showed no seasonal pattern during the 6-month
growing season, remaining fairly constant through-
out the period. These results are consistent with
those reported in Edwards & Norby (1999), even
though artiﬁcial temperature manipulations did
increase mortality rates across temperature treat-
ments in that study. Such lack of seasonality in
mortality is somewhat paradoxical since there is
support for shorter root life spans in trees as soil
temperatures increase (Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1993;
Pregitzer et al., 1997, 2000). Gill & Jackson (2000)
also noted that one might expect higher root
mortality
rates
during
periods
of
high
soil
temperatures since root respiration rates, nutrient
mineralization rates, and pathogen and herbivore
levels all increase with soil temperature. Although
our results do not support such a seasonal pattern,
the frequent occurrence of reductions of soil moist-
ure during the periods of highest soil temperature
are likely to introduce a confounding variable. Our
results also do not support an increase in root
mortality during leaf senescence in this upland oak
forest, in contrast to other studies on northern
hardwood
forests
(McClaugherty
et
al.,
1982;
Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1992, 1996).
Perhaps greater insight into possible causes of
higher rates of root turnover in our wet treatment
can be gained from studies that demonstrate that
root turnover rates are positively related to the
availability of nitrogen (N) in an ecosystem. The
throughfall treatments in our study are having a
statistically signiﬁcant impact on the accumulation
of foliar litter on the forest ﬂoor, such that litter
layers are thickest on the dry site and thinnest on the
wet site (Todd & Hanson, 1999). This is clearly a
result of a positive relationship between wetness of
the forest ﬂoor and litter decomposition rate. An
unexpected result of this litter accumulation is
increased immobilization of N and other nutrients in
the thicker forest ﬂoor layers on the drier sites,
probably resulting in its reduced availability for root
uptake. Evidence of lower nutrient availability in soil
solution nutrient concentrations on the dry site
compared with the wet site has recently appeared (D.
W. Johnson, pers. comm.). Although this hypothesis
is speculative at this point, Eissenstat et al. (2000)
note that increasing N concentrations in ﬁne roots
reduce longevity, which he attributes, in part, to
increasing respiration costs with higher N levels, as
reported by both Reich et al. (1998) and Pregitzer et
al. (1998). Nadelhoﬀer et al. (1985) and Nadelhoﬀer
(2000) have also found that root turnover rates are
positively correlated with soil N availability across a
number of studies. Eissenstat et al. (2000) further
128
RESEARCH
J. D. Joslin et al.
propose that the beneﬁts accrued from maintaining
roots with short life spans are reduced when
nutrients are in short supply.
High rates of FRT should result in greater
volumes of soil being explored, or at least the same
volumes being ‘re-explored’ with higher frequency,
and sites of high nutrient availability being ‘tapped’.
Whereas such exploration would appear to come at a
greater cost to trees in terms of C utilization for the
construction of new roots, the trees on the wetter site
also have greater annual rates of C ﬁxation and so can
perhaps ‘aﬀord’ the C expenditure. These hypoth-
eses point to the continued need to study the
interactions of water stress, nutrient availability and
C ﬁxation eﬃciency in future studies.
