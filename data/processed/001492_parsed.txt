Primary Science Goals
• Study spatial and temporal stellar magnetic activity patterns in a
sample of stars covering a broad range of activity level, in order to
understand the underlying dynamo process(es) and thereby
– enable improved forecasting of solar activity on time scales of days to
centuries, including Maunder-like minima and “grand maxima” that
significantly affect geospace and earth’s weather
– understand the impact of stellar magnetic activity on astrobiology & life
• Enable asteroseismology (acoustic imaging) to measure internal
stellar structure and rotation and their relationship to the dynamo
• Complete the assessment of external solar systems
– image the central stars of systems for which the Origins IR-interferometry
missions find and image planets, and determine the impact of  the activity of
those stars on the habitability of the surrounding planets

Stellar activity is key to understanding life
in the Universe and Earth’s habitability
   The stellar magnetic field
• slows the rotation of the collapsing cloud, enabling star formation
• couples evolution of star and pre-planetary disk
• results in energetic radiation conducive to the formation (&
destruction) of complex molecules
• governs the habitability of the biosphere through space weather
and planetary climate through luminosity, wind, magnetic fields,
and radiation
• Problem: there is no comprehensive model of solar/stellar
magnetic activity

The impact of the
Stellar Imager and Seismic Probe
Imaging stars and their environments and measuring their internal
structure and dynamics constitute a voyage of discovery and
exploration that will
• outdate theories that take stars to be static, layered spheres
• deepen our understanding of a broad range of physical processes
• strengthen the foundation of our view of the universe
• help forecast the activity of the Sun for our society that is
    living with a star

Space-weather forecasting
    To forecast solar and heliospheric activity
days to decades in advance, and to
understand solar activity in the past, we
need to develop and validate a dynamo
model
– Testing grounds:
• The Sun in detail
• Population studies:
– Stars like the Sun
– Other ``cool’’ dwarf & giant stars
– Very young stars
– Magnetically interacting binary stars
Required: a dynamo

Population study of cool stars
• To understand the dynamo, we need to know how
magnetic fields are generated and how they behave in
different circumstances
• The sun is only one example
– provides insufficient constraints on theories of dynamos,
turbulence, structure, and internal mixing
– must observe other stars to establish how mass, rotation,
brightness and age affect the patterns of activity  & determine:
• What determines cycle strength and duration?
• How common is solar-like activity?
• Can multiple cycles exist at the surface?
• What are Maunder-minimum states like?
• How do polar spots form?
• What are extremely (in)active stars like?

Activity and Stellar Interiors -
the Need for Asteroseismology
• Although its clearest manifestations are visible on the
stellar surface, a full understanding of the dynamo
requires a knowledge of the subsurface layers of the star
in which it resides
• Asteroseismology (acoustic imaging) of the star enables
us to address questions related to the stellar interior
– Where is the seat of the dynamo?
– What determines differential rotation and  meridional
circulation, and what role do they play in the dynamo?
– What is the impact of magnetic deceleration on internal
rotation and stellar evolution?
– How are stellar interiors modified in extremely active stars?

SISP Primary Performance Goals
• Image different stars of different activity
– for a substantial sample of nearby dwarf and giant stars,
obtain a resolution of  order 1000 pixels ( ~40,000 km on a
Sun-like star)
– study a sample in detail, revisiting over many years
– measure:
• sizes, lifetimes, and emergence patterns of stellar active regions
• surface differential rotation, field dispersal by convective motions,
and meridional circulation
• directly image the entire convection spectrum on giant stars, and the
supergranulation on, e.g., the solar counterpart α Cen
• Enable asteroseismology,  using low to intermediate degree
non-radial modes to measure internal stellar structure and
rotation.

SISP Design Requirements
• Imaging of stellar activity
– High contrast at UV wavelengths
– Obtain a stellar image as fast as possible to avoid
rotational smearing and activity evolution
• Imaging of stellar interiors
– Short integration times for seismology (minutes for
dwarf stars to hours for giant stars)
– Low-resolution imaging to measure non-radial resonant
waves (30-100 resolution elements)
– Flexible interferometer configuration

Strawman
Design Elements
• SISP is a large space-based UV-optical interferometer, that provides
a tool to astrophysicists of the same fundamental nature as the
microscope to biologists, yielding
– a spatial resolution of 60 and 120 micro-arcsec at 1500 Å and 2800 Å
– ~ 1000 pixels of resolution over the surface of nearby dwarf stars
– 9 or more 1-meter class telescopes, plus central “hub”
– largest telescope-pair baseline at least 500 meters
– observes in
• ~10-Ångstrom UV pass bands  (C3+  (100,000 K),  Mg+ h&k (10,000 K))
• broadband, near-UV or optical continuum (3,000-10,000 K)
– telescope formation reconfigurable for synthesis imaging
– 5-10 year mission to study stellar activity/magnetic cycles:
• individual telescopes/central hub can be refurbished or replaced as needed

Place in NASA
Strategic Roadmaps
• SISP fits on strategic path of  Origins interferometry missions
– it is a stepping stone towards crucial technology…
• SISP is comparable in complexity to the Terrestrial Planet Finder, and it may
serve as a useful technological and operational pathfinder for the Planet
Imager: SISP resolution is ~40x less demanding than ultimate NASA goal
– … while addressing science goals of 3 NASA/OSS research Themes
• understand why the sun varies (SEC)
• understand the origin of stars, planetary systems, and life (Origins)
• understand the structure and evolution of stars (SEU)
– it is complementary to the planetary imaging interferometers
• Terrestrial Planet Finder  and Planet Imager  null the stellar light to find and
image planets
• SISP images the central star to study the effects of that star on the habitability of
planets and the formation of  life on them.
• TPF, SISP, and PI together provide complete views of other solar systems
