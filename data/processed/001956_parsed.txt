Abstract: Parrots have been transported around the world since the 1400s and about 44 species have 
established populations outside of their native ranges.  At least 70% of these introduced species were 
identified as potential agricultural pests, compared to only 15% of all parrot species.  At least 74 exotic 
psittacines have been reported in the wild in the United States, but only nine species were considered 
established.  Since 1990, 24 psittacine species have been sighted in the wild in Hawai`i, about 21 species 
regularly occur on the main islands and at least five appear established.  Past history of successful 
introduction, recent status of introduced populations, and life history traits were used to identify parrots 
which, if introduced, appeared most likely to establish nonindigenous populations.  Potential impacts related 
to ecology, agriculture, and health were diverse but poorly documented in the literature.  Five species were 
the most widespread and abundant species, and were considered established.  Four more species with rapidly 
expanding ranges and increasing populations may become naturalized.  Nine species had significantly 
expanded ranges and increased populations.  Several introduced populations remained low for 10-15 years 
before rapidly increasing and becoming established; similar lag periods for other psittacines have approached 
30 years.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Exotic species invasions are a leading cause of 
native species declines and are a major 
environmental issue of public concern (Didhama et 
al. 2005).  The establishment of introduced species 
is recognized as a major ecological threat 
worldwide, and increasing volumes of international 
trade are expected to increase the rate at which 
species are unintentionally transported (Ricciardi et 
al. 2000).  Geographic and taxonomic patterns of 
exotic bird introductions are striking.  In their 
analyses of 1,378 introductions of 426 bird species 
around the world, Blackburn and Duncan (2001a) 
found that 40% occurred in four geographic areas: 
Hawai’i (163 introduction events), New Zealand 
(146), mainland United States (US, 125) and 
Australia (113).  On the 6 main Hawaiian Islands, 
at least 140 species of birds, belonging to 14 
different taxonomic orders and originating from 6 
continents have been introduced, including 75 
species of gamebirds (Long 1981, Moulton et al. 
2001).  Taxonomic patterns of successfully 
established exotic birds are also distinctly 
nonrandom and 7 families contained more 
successfully established exotic species than 
expected by chance: Anatidae (15 species of ducks 
and geese), Phasianidae (35 species of pheasants), 
Passeridae (30 species of sparrows and finches), 
Psittacidae (39 species of parrots), Columbidae (19 
species of pigeons and doves), Rheidae (2 species 
of rhea), and Odontophoridae (6 species of quail) 
(Lockwood 1999, Cassey 2002).   
 
Loope et al. (2001) noted that in contrast to 
mainland states like Florida, inadvertent 
colonization of Pacific islands is highly unlikely 
and all successfully established exotic birds in 
Hawai`i were deliberately brought to the islands for 
some purpose.  Limiting introductions therefore has 
relied mainly on regulating the trade in live birds 
and they predict that future introductions are likely 
to come from four groups: waterfowl, gallinaceous 
birds, psittacines, and passerines (especially 
finches).  In line with this, Foster (In Press) 
documented that overall patterns of bird 
introductions into Hawai`i have shifted over time 
from intentional releases to escapes of birds from 
captivity; since 1976 this has included at least 9 
psittacines.

In this paper, we highlight emerging populations 
of exotic parrots and review potential effects 
related to ecology, agriculture, and health.  Few 
data are available from Hawai’i and we review 
information from naturalized parrot populations on 
the mainland US to identify species with increasing 
and expanding naturalized breeding populations, 
those with traits similar to successfully established 
psittacines (Cassey et al. 2004b) and with the 
potential to become agricultural pests if established. 
 
Williamson (1996) identified 4 steps in the 
process of invasion of a region by exotic species as 
a result of human activity, and these steps have 
served as a basis for several subsequent studies of 
patterns of success for introduced birds.  Blackburn 
and Duncan (2001a) labeled the stages of this 
process as “transport, introduction, establishment 
and spread.”   Usage of some relevant terms was 
not uniform and we followed the generalized 
definitions of Kolar and Lodge (2001).  Indigenous 
species: a species found within its native range.  
Invasive species: a nonindigenous species that 
spreads from the point of introduction and becomes 
abundant.  Nonindigenous species: a species 
introduced to areas beyond its native range by 
human activity; exotic species is commonly used 
synonymously.  Noninvasive species are 
nonindigenous species that remain localized within 
a new environment.  Established species are species 
with self-sustaining populations outside of the 
native range.  Introduced birds are deemed 
established by the American Ornithologists Union 
(AOU 1998) “if there are persistent records for at 
least 10 years and satisfactory evidence of 
maintaining a reasonably stable or increasing 
population through successful reproduction.” (i.e., 
not supported by continued releases).  Long 
lifespan makes determining establishment in 
parrots more difficult than in other groups, but 30 
species have been successfully introduced in at 
least one location outside of their native ranges, and 
introductions of an additional 14 parrot species 
were probably successful (Long 1981, Cassey et al. 
2004a, b, Table 1). 
 
OVERVIEW OF PSITTACIFORMES 
 
The Order Psittaciformes is a distinct group of 
birds with large hooked bills and zygodactyl feet.  
There are 2 families: Cacatuidae (cockatoos) and 
Psittacidae (parrots).  Origins have been traced 
back to the Miocene in Queensland and Australia is 
considered the center of evolution and radiation for 
psittacines (del Hoyo et al. 1997).  Diversity of 
parrots is highest in Australasia and South America 
with about one-third of all parrot species occurring 
in each regions.  Comprehensive species accounts 
were compiled by Juniper and Parr (1998), Forshaw 
(1977), and del Hoyo et al. (1997); and online at 
www.arndt-verlag.com.  This overview follows the 
taxonomic nomenclature of del Hoyo et al. (1997). 
 
INFLUENCES ON ESTABLISHMENT 
SUCCESS 
 
Once established, the control or eradication of 
invasive species is highly costly, and preventing 
introduction and establishment is preferable (Kolar 
and Lodge 2001).  This has prompted researchers to 
characterize established species in order to identify 
potentially invasive species before the invasion has 
occurred.  Traits associated with invasive birds are 
as varied as migratory habits (Kolar and Lodge 
2001), broad diet and habitat niches (Cassey et al. 
2004b, c), and behavioral flexibility and forebrain 
size (Sol and Lefebvre 2000).  Although there are 
intrinsic differences in the ability of bird species to 
invade new locations, various studies (e.g., 
Lockwood 1999, Sol and Lefebvre 2000) have 
confirmed that introduction effort, defined as the 
number of releases or numbers released at a 
location, is the principal factor influencing numbers 
of nonindigenous bird species. 
 
Introduction effort is correlated with many 
variables previously thought to influence 
establishment success (Blackburn and Duncan 
2001a, b), and highlights its importance both within 
and across large regions including oceanic islands 
(Cassey et al. 2005).  Moulton et al. (2001) found a 
significant relationship between introduction effort 
and success rates of Galliformes (game birds) 
introduced to the Island of Hawai`i.  Even though 
successful establishment ultimately depends on the 
particular combination of a species and a location 
(Blackburn and Duncan 2001a, b) this consistent 
finding regarding introduction effort suggests that 
fewer species will become established if the 
number of releases or number of individuals is 
minimized. 
 
The Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 
specifies that wild-caught birds may be imported 
into the US only if they come from a country with a 
US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) approved 
management plan for sustainable use of the species.  
Before this, the US was the world’s largest

importer of parrots from wild populations.  At least 
150,000 live parrots were imported in 1990 (World 
Wildlife Fund 2007).  Since passage of this Act, 
parrot imports have decreased, and captive 
breeding for the pet trade has increased.  Since 
1990, numbers imported have declined to about 
17,000/year (World Wildlife Fund 2007).  Mass 
importation, and thus mass releases and escapes, of 
wild-caught parrots into the US appear to be greatly 
reduced (Brightsmith 1999). 
 
International restrictions in wildlife trade have 
similarly reduced parrot exports.  From 1989-90 to 
1999, numbers exported from the five main 
producer countries (Argentina, Guyana, Indonesia, 
Senegal, and Tanzania) dropped from 245,000 to 
57,360 birds.  Although actual origins are 
uncertain, 9 of the species recently sighted in 
Hawai`i were exported from these 5 countries.  
Exports of 8 of the species dropped from 88,790 to 
26,290; in contrast, burrowing parakeets 
(Cyanoliseus patagonus) from Argentina entered 
the trade during this period and nearly 7,500 were 
exported (Roe et al. 2002).  Despite increased 
regulation and quarantine requirements 2,811 
parrots of 28 species were legally imported into 
Hawai`i in 1999 (Foster 2005, Hawai`i Department 
of Agriculture, unpublished data). 
 
Future feral populations will most likely 
originate from small numbers of captive-bred pet 
parrots, rather than from large numbers of wild-
caught birds.  Thus, the process of establishment 
will likely be slow, requiring perhaps several 
decades, and the probability that additional parrot 
populations will become established should now be 
relatively low.  However, releases of wild-caught 
birds being traded illegally are still possible.  
Cassey et al. (2004a, b) closely examined the 
patterns of transport, release and establishment of 
parrots around the world, and while the availability 
of individual birds for transport and release was 
very important, this had no obvious effect on 
establishment following release.  Their multivariate 
statistical study revealed significant and 
independent effects of diet breadth, elevational 
range, and migratory habit.  Sedentary, non-
migratory, parrots and those with broad diets or 
large elevation ranges had higher establishment 
success.  Other significant traits included lower 
fecundity, and longer fledgling periods. 
 
At least 74 exotic psittacines have been reported 
in the wild in the US, but only 9 species are 
established (Table 2).  Prior to 1981, 14 parrots had 
been introduced to the main Hawaiian islands

(Berger 1981, Long 1981, Moulton et al. 2001, 
Table 3), but few are considered established (Pratt 
et al. 1987, Pyle 2002), at least one has been (Pyle 
2002).  Since 1970 (R. Pyle, unpublished data), 28 
psittacines have been sighted in the wild in the 
state, species richness was highest on the islands of 
O`ahu (21) and Hawai`i (13).  Currently, about 21 
species regularly occur on the main islands 
including 11 breeding species (Table 4), and a few 
more species now appear to be established.  Some 
species are being controlled and, hence, may not 
become established. 
 
ESTABLISHMENT PATTERNS 
 
Generally, only a small proportion of exotic 
birds introduced to new locations have established 
wild populations, and have created negative 
impacts in the new environment (Lockwood 1999).  
Overall, less than 3% of all avian species have 
established nonindigenous populations somewhere 
in the world (Lockwood 1999) and 36% of alien 
birds introduced to Hawai'i have established 
breeding populations (Loope et al. 2001).  Overall, 
parrots had even higher rates of establishment: 70% 
of 54 species intentionally released established 
naturalized populations (Cassey et al. 2004b).  For 
long-lived birds like parrots, it can be hard to know 
if they are truly established, or are simply living out 
a long life span in a new location.   
 
The highest diversity and abundance of 
nonindigenous parrots in the US occurs primarily in 
the subtropical areas of Florida, California and 
Texas (Pranty and Garrett 2003).  The proportion of 
introduced and naturalized species is greater in 
urban/suburban areas than in rural areas and parrots 
fit this pattern (Spreyer and Bucher 1998, Lamont 
2002, Butler 2003, Domenech et al. 2003, Eguchi 
and Amano 2004).  Additionally, parrots usually 
exploit habitats dominated by exotic flora (Lamont 
2002).  In a few cases, however, a parrot species 
will colonize important agricultural areas 
(Domenech et al. 2003). 
 
The occurrence of feral parrots non- 
urban/suburban areas may be due to a relatively 
large pool of potential escapees.  Compared to rural 
areas, densities of pet parrots, like people, are likely 
much higher in urbanized areas; both density and 
diversity of feral parrots is especially high near 
ports of entry (e.g., Miami, Honolulu).  Like 
southern California and southeastern Florida, 
Hawai`i has a mild climate, urban areas extensively 
landscaped with exotic vegetation, and major ports 
of entry.  This, along with a lack of natural 
predators and abundant sources of invasive exotic

introduced parrots will establish naturalized 
populations of psittacines.  Three of the 9 species 
established on the mainland US (Table 2) are 
present and established in Hawai`i and  if 
introduced, the other 6 presumably have the 
capacity to become established. 
 
METHODS 
 
We compiled and tabulated life history 
information (T. Pratt and J. Foster, unpublished 
data, Forshaw 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1997, Juniper 
and Parr 1998).  Introduction histories were gleaned 
from Garret et al. (1997), Simberloff et al. (1997), 
Lever (1987), Long (1981), and reviews of official 
state lists of bird status and occurrence for 
California, Florida and Texas.  Using these data we 
calculated scores for three of the traits shown by 
Cassey et al. (2004b) to be correlated with 
successful establishment of introduced psittacines: 
extent of altitudinal range, diet breadth, and degree 
of migration.  The scores used in their analyses 
were not available to us, and we calculated them 
based on the descriptions in Cassey et al. (2004b).  
Altitude range was the difference between the 
normal upper and lower altitudinal range limits of a 
species in its natural range.  Diet breadth reflected 
the composition of each species diet scored as 
presence or absence of five different food types: 
fruit/berry, seed/grain, vegetative material, animal 
343 
 
material or nectar/flower.  Each diet category was 
scored as 0 or 1 and summed (range 1 to 5).  
Cassey et al. (2004b) scored diets based on the first 
four of these categories only.  Degree of migration 
was scored as: (0) for resident species with local 
movements only, (1) for nomadic species with 
irruptive seasonal movements, and (2) for species 
with regular altitudinal or geographical migrations.  
Unlike the previous two variables, migration score 
was inversely related to establishment success 
(Cassey et al. 2004b).  We scored migration habit 
for a limited number of parrots which scored highly 
for altitudinal range and diet breadth, or which we 
judged potentially important based on their 
likelihood of establishment success, presence in 
Hawai'i, etc.  For a similarly limited number of 
species we also noted if they were identified as 
agricultural pests, or reportedly fed on crops or 
orchards in their native ranges (del Hoyo et al. 
1997). 
 
In an effort to identify psittacines that could 
become established, and perhaps invasive, we 
searched data from the National Audubon Society’s 
(NAS) annual Christmas Bird Counts (CBC) and 
looked for parrots that were both widespread and 
abundant.  Our figures were created from the data 
accessible from the Audubon website: 
www.audubon.org/bird/cbc.  To examine relative 
distribution among species we used the number of 
count circles where a species was reported in each 
count year for each state.  For abundance we used 
the sum of all individuals reported in each count 
year for each state.  Because we were most 
interested in total numbers of birds reported, rather 
than in statistical trend analyses, we have presented 
these data uncorrected for survey effort, and have 
made no inferences to larger geographical areas 
outside of the CBC circles.  However, we note that 
there are both advantages and limitations to using 
CBC data to examine status of exotic birds (Pranty 
2002, Butler 2005). 
 
To identify broadly distributed psittacines with 
large populations, we examined counts from seven 
recent CBC seasons (winters of 1999-2000 through 
2005-2006) from the three states with the highest 
diversity of exotic parrots: California, Florida and 
Texas.  As a relative index to the extent of 
distribution within each state we used the 
maximum number of count circles that reported 
each species during this time period.  The 
maximum of the annual sum of all individuals 
reported was used to index each species abundance.  
To facilitate visual comparisons among species 
these two index values were used as x,y coordinates 
to plot distribution on the horizontal axis and 
abundance on the vertical axis. 
 
We used similar metrics to portray recent 
changes in distribution and abundance with indices 
based on changes in numbers of CBC count circles 
and numbers of birds counted for each of the three  
states.  For each species, changes in distribution 
were indexed as: 
 
 No. of count circles reported in 2006 ÷ 
No. of count circles reported in 2000 
 
Changes in abundance were similarly indexed as: 
Total no. of individuals reported in 2006 
÷ Total no. reported in 2000 
 
 
Our goal was to highlight species that had 
clearly shown the ability become both widespread 
and abundant.  Our measures of distribution and 
abundance are ordinal indexes only, not statistical 
estimates.  For inferences comparing abundances of 
different species and changes over time, statistical 
analyses were limited to nonparametric, rank order 
methods using SAS® version 9.1 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).  Spearman rank correlation coefficients 
(Rs) were used to analyze long-term (>10 years) 
trends in abundance and distribution of exotic 
parrot species on CBC circles within California and 
Florida; data from Texas were too sparse to 
analyze.  To identify species with significant trends 
over time, Rs was calculated by year with number 
of individual birds reported; and for year with 
number of CBC circles where a species was 
reported.  Rs values, and significance levels, 
reflected how closely the rank order of each 
variable corresponded with year.  Inferences here 
were limited to concluding whether or not trends 
over time were statistically significant at the 10% 
level; we did not calculate trend lines or estimate 
rates of population growth. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Psittacines with successful, or probably 
successful, introduced populations somewhere in 
the world are listed in Table 1.  Most were from the 
subfamily Psittacinae, but five cacatuids, and four 
loriinids were also included.  An established 
species becomes invasive when both distribution 
and abundance increase, and data from CBC circles 
(NAS 2002) demonstrated that monk parakeets, 
from South America, have increased in both

numbers and distribution in North America (Figure 
1a).  Originating from multiple releases in the 
1960s, they have recently bred in 11 states and 
Puerto Rico (Spreyer and Butcher 1998).  At the 
same time, rose-ringed parakeet populations, 
introduced to the US in the mid-1960s to 1970s, 
have remained much more limited (Figure 1b) and 
were largely restricted to southern California, south 
Florida and Kaua’i.  Patterns of population growth 
for established psittacines in Florida varied (Figures 
2, 3) and included a period of slow growth followed 
by rapid expansion in both range and population 
size for monk (Myiopsitta monachus) and black-
hooded parakeets (Nandayus nenday); both are now 
established members of the local avifauna.  The 
initial high growth rate and spread of the 
budgerigar population, fueled by large scale 
releases of captive-bred birds, was followed by a 
sudden collapse (Figure 2b).  Such crashes are 
common among naturalized species (Simberloff 
and Gibbons 2003) and exotic birds whose 
populations have exploded may not remain 
abundant.  Examples from Hawai`i include the 
common myna (Acridotheres tristis), red-billed

varius, Foster 2005). 
 
There were sufficient data to examine long-term 
(11 to 33 years) trends in distribution and 
abundance for 15 species in California and Florida 
(Table 5).  Mitred (Aratinga mitrata), black-hooded 
and yellow-chevroned parakeets (Brotogeris 
chiriri) each had significant (P ≤ 0.10) positive 
correlations over time for both numbers of 
individual birds reported and numbers of CBC 
circles within both states.  Hence, both numbers 
and distribution increased over time.  Conversely, 
budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), yellow-
headed parrots (Amazona oratrix), and red-crowned 
parrots (Amazona viridigenalis) showed significant 
negative correlations, indicating declines over time 
in Florida. 
 
Data from CBC circles within California and 
Texas were adequate to portray the relative status 
of 16 species (Figures 4, 5), and 26 species in 
Florida (Figures 6, 7).  These graphic summaries 
provided a snapshot of the relative status of 
different species on a state-by-state basis; 
widespread and abundant parrots appeared in the 
upper right, while smaller relatively localized 
populations appeared closer to the origin (Figures 
4, 6).  Populations which may have been relatively 
small and limited geographically, but which 
recently showed rapid increases in distribution and 
abundance appeared further to the right and above 
those with slowly expanding populations (Figures 
5, 7).  Numbers of three Brotogeris parakeets 
counted on CBC circles within California and 
Florida peaked at 200-300 (Figures 8, 9).  Similarly 
for five species of Aratinga parakeets, numbers 
peaked at <100 to >300 (Figures 8, 10).   
 
Rose-ringed parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were 
first recorded from CBC circles in Florida in 1974 
(Figure 11), but were not reported from California 
until 10 years later with numbers relatively low for 
many years.  Similarly, black-hooded parakeets 
were first recorded in Florida in 1981, about 10 
years before they were reported from California, 
and were well established in south Florida by the 
early 2000s.  Trends for five Amazona species are 
shown in Figures 12-14.  Numbers of three 
Amazona species counted on CBC circles within 
California and Florida peaked at less than 50 birds, 
numbers of two others were higher (Figures 12-14).  
 
Pranty (2001, 2002) used CBC data to graph 
population changes over time for 10 species of 
exotics, including three psittacines.  Brightsmith 
(1999) used data from specific CBCs in south 
Florida and Los Angeles to help describe changes

review of feral parrot populations, Butler (2005) 
described the status of several species on CBC 
circles within the US and identified five psittacines 
with significantly increasing populations: mitred, 
blue-crowned (Aratinga acuticaudata), and black-
hooded parakeets, blue-fronted parrot (Amazona 
aestiva) , and chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severa).  
Our results supported the idea that the three 
parakeets he identified have expanded in both 
numbers and distribution, and that the blue-fronted 
parrot population has increased (Table 5), but we 
could not confirm this for the chestnut-fronted 
macaw. 
 
Population trends of monk parakeets have been 
analyzed with CBC data (Van Bael and Pruett-
Jones 1996, Avery et al. 2002, Pruett-Jones et al. 
2007) to show that the US and Florida populations 
of monk parakeets were increasing exponentially 
and doubling every six to seven years.  Similar 
population expansions have been observed in 
Europe, where the species is also established (Sol et 
al. 1997).  Plots of recent CBC data suggested that 
they may beginning to decline (Figure 1, 2) but 
long-term trends in abundance and distribution in 
Florida (Table 5) and across the US were positive 
(Rs > 0.92, P< 0.0001). 
 
Monk parakeets are the best example of an 
invasive pest parrot in North America, but while 
distribution has increased over time (Figure 1) it 
remains limited.  They have been reported from no 
more than 2.8% of all CBC circles across North 
America, but at the statewide scale they have been 
reported from up to 35% of the circles in Florida.  
To put these numbers in perspective, in recent 
decades, the invasive European starling has 
occurred on up to 96% of CBC circles across North 
America. 
 
In contrast to the monk parakeet, the budgerigar 
population, which was deliberately established after 
repeated releases of up to 3,000 birds along the 
central Gulf Coast of Florida, did not become 
invasive (Figure 2).  In the late-1970s, total 
numbers in the wild peaked at >20,000 birds.  The 
population was concentrated in five counties along 
the Gulf Coast, but included birds widely scattered 
across 31 of Florida’s 67 counties (Pranty 2001).  
 
Budgerigars then declined dramatically in both 
abundance and distribution during the 1980s and 
1990s, and recently numbered <200 birds in just 
two counties (Wenner and Hirth 1984, Pranty 2001, 
NAS 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation 
Commission 2003).  Pranty (2001) and Butler 
(2005) reviewed the potential causes for this 
population crash, but data are sparse and no firm 
conclusion has been presented.  A breeding 
population on Tresco Island in the United Kingdom 
(UK) followed a similar track: in less than 10 years, 
 
10 pairs increased to 100 birds then crashed and 
vanished after the resident who fed the birds moved 
away (Butler 2005).  Rank correlation analyses for 
budgerigars reflected the dramatic decline in 
numbers from CBC circles within Florida, but the 
decline in distribution (Figure 2) was not 
significant (Table 5).  An intermediate example 
(Figure 2c) is the recently established black-hooded 
parakeet population whose limited range is 
expanding in Florida (NAS 2002, Pranty and Lovell 
2004).  They are not currently considered invasive, 
but their numbers appear to be on the same 
trajectory as the monk parakeet (Figure 3).   
 
Our calculations and graphs were designed to 
compare the relative abundance and distribution 
status of exotic populations of parrots in order to 
identify species that have increased rapidly in 
numbers and distribution.  Our comparisons were 
relative and restricted to psittacines reported from 
CBC circles and the distribution of most species 
was relatively limited.  In California, none occurred 
on more than 8 count circles.  For Texas, the 
maximum number of CBCs was 7 seven circles 
(Figure 4).  Similarly for Florida, only two species 
(monk and black-hooded parakeets) were reported 
from more than 4 CBCs (Figure 6).   
 
The graphic summaries of recent (1999-2006) 
data from CBC circles within Florida, California, 
and Texas highlighted the following species as 
relatively widespread and abundant: monk 
parakeet, black-hooded parakeet, red-crowned 
parrot, green parakeet (Aratinga holochlora) , and 
mitred parakeet (Figures 4, 6).  These 5 species 
were previously recognized as established by 
experts in the US (Table 2).  The most rapidly 
expanding and increasing species in these years 
were the blue-crowned parakeet, white-eyed 
parakeet (Aratinga leucophthalmus), lilac-crowned 
parrot (Amazona finschi) and red-lored parrot 
(Amazona autumnalis lilcana; Figures 5, 7) which 
may be in the process of establishing naturalized 
populations.  In addition to these, longer-term 
trends in numbers indicate that the yellow-
chevroned and white-winged parakeet (Brotogeris 
versicolurus) are capable of rapid, if not sustained, 
population increases (Figures 8, 9). 
 
As predicted by an exponential population 
growth curve, many exotic vertebrate populations 
have shown lag phases in population growth after  
introduction (Mack et al. 2000).  After initial 
releases, introduced populations may first grow 
slowly as they build momentum and then suddenly 
irrupt.  Following releases in Hawai`i, several 
currently naturalized birds were not found breeding 
or even sighted for many years (e.g., barn owls 
(Tyto alba), white-rumped shama (Copsychus 
malabaricus), and Guam swiftlets (Aerodramus 
bartschi; Foster 2005).  Populations of the common 
myna and red-billed leiothrix both experienced a 
slow building period followed by rapid growth in 
Hawai`i (Foster 2005).  CBC data reflected a 
similar pattern for several introduced parrot 
populations as well.  Examples from Florida 
included monk parakeets (Figures 2, 3) and white-
eyed parakeets (Figure 8) whose numbers built 
slowly for >10 years.  In comparison, red-masked 
parakeet counts remained low for about 15 years 
(Figure 10).  Black-hooded parakeets were recently 
accepted as an established part of Florida’s 
avifauna following a lag of about 15 years (Figures 
2, 3, 11).  Counts of several Amazona spp. 
fluctuated greatly but have remained low for 10-20 
years (Figures 12, 13).  Similarly, Maui’s mitred 
parakeet population, which was founded by a single 
pair, took 15 years to reach 200 (Runde and Pitt 
2006).  The lag periods for south Florida’s yellow-
chevroned and white-winged parakeets appeared 
short at about 5 years (Figures 8, 9), but both 
populations were founded by large-scale escapes of 
wild birds in the pet trade (Brightsmith 1999).   
 
Lag periods for rose-ringed parakeets appear to 
be on the scale of decades.  Numbers on California 
CBCs remained <200 for >20 years and still 
appeared low after 30 years in Florida (Figure 11).  
Established populations of rose-ringed parakeets in 
the UK appeared to grow slowly from 1969-1996, 
but have increased exponentially since then.  
Annual increases have recently been estimated at 
15 to 30%, but range expansion at 300-400 m/yr 
has been relatively slow (Butler 2003).  Similar 
growth rates were noted in the Netherlands, where 
the population has increased at a rate of 22.5% per 
year since 1994 (Keiji 2001).  For long-lived 
parrots with low reproductive rates, this 
phenomenon of long lag periods preceding 
exponential population growth makes it especially 
difficult to determine if feral populations will 
become established or invasive and argues for 
timely control of incipient populations even though 
they may appear stagnant for 20-30 years.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF EXOTIC 
PARROTS  
 
Established populations of exotic parrots may 
pose problems to Hawai`i’s natural systems as well 
as human health and safety, and agriculture.  Since 
there are no native psittacines, emerging parrot 
populations may present novel threats to Hawai`i’s 
ecology in ways that previous bird introductions 
have not.  Although most psittacines are seed 
predators and are not generally recognized as seed 
dispersers, they do feed on many exotic invasive 
plants and there is concern that they may disperse 
viable seeds and over large areas.  For example, 
mitred parakeets are known to feed on Miconia 
calvescens berries in their home range and captive 
feeding trials on Maui indicated that they can pass 
viable Miconia seeds (Gassmann-Duval 2002). and 
thus may currently be a factor in the long distance 
dispersal of invasive Miconia into native forests 
and other areas where much effort has been put into 
eradication.  However, most parrots are seed 
predators feeding on immature seeds, thus the 
extent to which exotic parrots in general may 
disperse alien plants is unclear (Loope et al. 2001; 
J. Gilardi, personal communication). 
 
As seed predators, parrots may inhibit 
reproduction of native tree species.  Important 
foods for exotic parrots in Los Angeles included 
several palms (Araceae spp.; Garrett et al. 1997) 
and introduced sulfur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua 
galerita) reportedly fed on hearts of palm and 
devastated large stands of two endemic palms 
found only in Palau's rock islands (Engbring 1992, 
Loope et al. 2001, National Environmental 
Protection Council 2004).  Thus, introduced 
psittacines may threaten Hawai`i’s endangered 
loulu palms (Pritchardia spp.) and other native 
trees and shrubs with large seeds. 
 
On Maui, direct competition between mitred 
parakeets and native birds has been observed in the 
displacement of frigate birds (Fregata minor) from 
roosting areas and in competition with shearwaters 
(Puffinus spp.) and petrels (Pterodroma spp.) for 
nesting sites in cliff-side burrows (MISC 2002) and 
may also be in conflict with Hawaiian black 
noddies (Anous minutus).  A similar situation may 
exist with the burrowing parakeets on the Kona 
Coast.  Roughly half of all psittacines include 
flower parts, nectar, or pollen in their diets and in 
Hawai`i, there is concern that these species could 
feed on native ohia trees (Metrosideros 
polymorpha) and other native flowering plants and 
might devastate native honeycreeper populations by 
competing for nectar resources (Loope et al. 2001). 
 
A variety of parrot species are well-known 
agricultural pests in their native ranges typically 
targeting a wide variety of fruits, grains and oilseed 
crops (Bomford 1992).  Habitats of about 30% of 
psittacines included orchards, plantations or 
croplands, but <4% included major Hawaiian crops 
such as coffee plantations or flooded taro fields.  
Cultivated tropical fruits, also important Hawaiian 
crops, were specifically included in summaries of 
diets for <10% of species; mango, citrus, banana 
and papaya were most frequent.  Maize or various 
nut crops were included in diets of about 20% of 
species (T. Pratt and J. Foster, unpublished data).  
The agricultural impact of parrots in Hawai`i has 
not been assessed, but the potential for damage by 
existing species is evidenced by the fact that over 
70% (17) of the 24 psittacines recently sighted in 
the state were identified as agricultural pest species, 
or as feeding on cultivated crops, orchards, etc. in 
their native ranges (Table 4).  In a recent survey of 
farmers across Hawai`i, only 2% of respondents 
were concerned about damage from parrots to fruits 
and vegetables, such as corn, bananas, and papaya 
(NWRC, unpublished data).  Our analyses suggest 
that the species most likely to emerge as 
agricultural pests in the US, if established, were the 
Aratinga parakeets and Amazona parrots of South 
America, cockatoos and corellas (Cacatua spp.) 
from Australia, lovebirds from Africa, and 
Psittacula parakeets from Africa and Asia.   
 
The devastating impact of introduced parasites 
and disease on native Hawaiian forest birds has 
been well documented (Berger 1975; Van Riper et 
al. 1986, Van Riper and Scott 2001, Van Riper et 
al. 2002) and parrots can carry a variety of diseases 
that could impact native forest birds.  As potential 
disease vectors, wide-ranging parrot populations 
threaten not only native bird species, but also 
poultry flocks, cage birds, aviculture, and human 
health.  Diseases potentially transmissible to man or 
other birds include avian influenza, psittacosis (also 
known as ornithosis, chlamydiosis, and parrot 
fever), salmonellosis, pseudotuberculosis, 
tuberculosis, avian malaria, avian pox, erysipelas, 
pasteurellosis and Newcastle's disease.  Of these, 
the first five are potentially of importance to human 
health.  It has not yet been determined if any of the 
free-ranging parrots in Hawai`i carry these 
diseases.  Since 2002, restrictions aimed at 
reducing imports of birds potentially infected with 
Newcastle disease and West Nile Virus into 
Hawai`i have been imposed.  However, thousands 
357 
 
of birds have recently been imported into the State 
each year (Foster 2005).  Currently, avian influenza 
if of great concern worldwide and there is 
widespread recognition of the risk of disease 
transmission associated with wildlife translocations 
and international trade in birds (Fevre et al. 2006).  
For highly pathogenic avian influenza (subtype 
H5N1), there is a potential for pandemic spread and 
cross-species transmission. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Every invasive species was first introduced, and 
introduction effort is clearly the most important 
influence on the establishment of exotic birds in 
general, and of parrots in particular.  Thus, 
minimizing the frequency of introductions, and the 
numbers of parrots released, will be the best way to 
prevent exotic parrots from becoming established in 
the future.  This basic principle can be broadly 
applied; in their review of the status of a wide 
variety of exotic wildlife in North America and 
Europe, Jeschke and Strayer (2005) concluded, 
“…once a vertebrate is introduced, it has a high 
potential to become invasive.  Thus, it is crucial to 
minimize the number of species introductions to 
effectively control invasive vertebrates”.  Because 
invasive species are rarely eradicated, and their 
damages will be borne for long periods, prevention 
is the best cure and will likely be the most cost-
effective cure in the long run (Keller et al. 2007).  
As advocated by Loope et al. (2001), the list of 
birds permitted into Hawai’i should be reassessed 
to eliminate species with high risk of invasion.  Past 
history of successful introduction, and trends in 
distribution and abundance of introduced 
populations are a reliable basis to identify parrots 
that pose a high risk of invasion.  We used this 
along with three life history traits (extent of altitude 
range, diet breadth and degree of migration) to 
screen psittacines and identified 22 species which 
appeared most likely to establish naturalized 
breeding populations, if introduced.  Currently, 17 
of these are conditionally approved for import, 
meaning that permits may be granted for 
“individual possession, businesses, or institutions” 
(Hawai`i Department of Agriculture HRS Chapter 
71).  Policy makers might consider these as 
potential candidates for early detection 
surveillance, rapid response planning, or stricter 
import regulations.
