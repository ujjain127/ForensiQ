Highlights of the NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation
 Evaluation of indoor air quality at the 
Rehabilitation Services Commission (RSC)
NIOSH investigators visited the RSC building in Columbus, Ohio to evaluate the indoor air quality. They inspected
the building’s interior and exterior, and all air- handling units.  They measured moisture in building materials and
general indoor air quality comfort parameters.  They interviewed 29 employees to assess symptoms potentially related
to the work environment.
What NIOSH Did
#
We checked the building’s interior and exterior for
moisture problems.
#
We looked at the air-handling units (AHU).
#
We measured moisture throughout the building.
#
We measured temperature, relative humidity, and
carbon dioxide in the building..
#
We talked to employees regarding health concerns
related to the work environment.
#
We looked at the medical records of employees
known to have certain illnesses.
What NIOSH Found
#
Some AHUs did not drain very well (standing
water was in a few of the units).
#
A bathroom exhaust fan was not working during
our survey.
#
AHUs appeared clean and provided good air
filtration, but did not provide enough outside air
during our evaluation.
#
Reported symptoms included asthma, and eye,
nose, and throat irritation.
What Rehabilitation Services
Commission Managers Can Do
#
Bring in more outside air by adjusting outside air
intakes on AHU’s.

SUMMARY
On May 5, 2000, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request from
employees at the Rehabilitation Services Commission (RSC) regarding indoor air quality problems at the
RSC building in Columbus, Ohio.  Health concerns included chronic sinus infections, allergies, asthmatic
bronchitis, and chronic pulmonary problems.  On July 11 and 12, 2000, NIOSH investigators conducted a
walk-through inspection of the building’s interior and exterior, and of the air handling units (AHU).
Measurements to detect moisture incursion and general indoor air quality comfort parameters were also
made.  NIOSH physicians interviewed 29 employees to assess health complaints potentially related to the
work environment. 
Moisture measurements on the inside of the exterior walls and the concrete slab did not indicate a chronic
water incursion problem.  The AHUs appeared clean and provided good air filtration.  The condensate pans
on some of the AHU were not draining properly.  The building was under positive pressure; the cafeteria was
under negative pressure to minimize odors in the building.  One non-functional bathroom exhaust fan was
identified.  Several carbon dioxide measurements exceeded 800 ppm, indicating an inadequate supply of
outdoor air.  The AHUs were recently switched from a manual adjustment system to a computer- controlled
system.  Although the computer-controlled system indicated air intakes at 10%, they were actually closed.
Thirteen of the 29 employees interviewed reported a physician diagnosis of asthma.  Six of these employees
reported a consistent increase in symptoms related to being in the workplace.  In addition to asthma, 10 of
the 29 employees interviewed reported upper respiratory symptoms or mucous membrane irritation
temporally related to the work environment.  Ten of the 29 reported having positive allergy tests for dust
mites.  Four employees reported no symptoms related to work.  
Medical records were obtained for three individuals who reported being diagnosed with asthma since
beginning work at the RSC, and who reported a consistent increase in symptoms related to being at work.
One of the three had information in the medical record possibly consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, but
no evidence of a decrement in lung function at work; two did not have documented evidence of asthma.  
Among the 29 persons interviewed, the most frequently reported observation was that the work environment
was dusty and the cloth-covered cubicles were dirty.  Several persons complained of odors from the kitchen.
In addition, several employees reported the use of ion-generating or electrostatic precipitator air cleaners
(these air cleaners may produce ozone) at their desks.
v
There was no evidence of a significant indoor air quality problem at the RSC building.  Minor
problems were noted, including a non-operational bathroom exhaust fan, a deficiency in
supplied outdoor air, and the use of ozone generating air cleaners.  Reported symptoms included
asthma, and eye, nose, and throat irritation.  Recommendations include repair of the bathroom
fan, adjusting the outside air dampers to increase the supply of outdoor air, and elimination of
ozone-generating air cleaners.

INTRODUCTION
On May 5, 2000, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
received a confidential request from employees at
the Rehabilitation Services Commission (RSC)
regarding indoor air quality (IAQ) problems at the
RSC building in Columbus, Ohio.  Health
concerns included chronic sinus infections,
allergies, asthmatic bronchitis, and chronic
pulmonary problems.
On July 11-12, 2000, NIOSH investigators
conducted a site visit at the RSC building.  An
opening conference was held with RSC
management, facility maintenance personnel,
union representatives, and concerned employees.
Information was obtained relating to the building
and the history of the concerns involving IAQ
issues.  A walk-through inspection of the
building’s interior and exterior focused on the
eight heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
(HVAC) units located on the roof and on past
moisture incursion.  Temperature, relative
humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were
measured inside the building on July 12, 2000.
Private medical interviews were conducted to
assess health complaints potentially related to the
work environment.  A closing conference was
held on July 12, 2000, during which preliminary
findings were discussed.
BACKGROUND
Building and Ventilation
System Description
The RSC is located in a 12-year-old one-story
brick and glass structure with approximately
142,000 square feet (ft2) of indoor floor space.
The building is occupied mainly during the hours
between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.  Over 600
employees work in the RSC building.  The
majority of the office space is open, with rows of
cubicles separated by carpeted partitions
approximately four feet in height.  The cubicles
are equipped with typical office furniture,
including video display terminals and keyboards.
The entire building is carpeted, with the exception
of the main hallway (located through the center of
the building) and the cafeteria area.  Smoking is
not permitted inside the RSC building.  
The ventilation system consists of eight large
variable-air-volume HVAC units (each with a
capacity of providing 18,000 cubic feet per
minute) mounted on the roof.  Return air is
supplied through an open plenum above the
ceiling.  The temperature and amount of outdoor
air introduced into the building are automatically
controlled.  During our survey, the night-time
temperature controls were set at 68°F for a low
temperature and 78°F for a high temperature.  The
outside air intake for each of the HVAC units was
set at 10% during the time of our evaluation.
Each HVAC unit was equipped with 60% -
efficient bag filters. 
METHODS
Industrial Hygiene
Evaluation
NIOSH investigators inspected the interior and
exterior of the building for evidence of water
damage and microbial contamination to identify
potential sources of contamination and pathways
for moisture vapor intrusion.  The eight HVAC
units mounted on the roof of the building were
also inspected. 
Indicators of occupant comfort were measured in
various locations.  Real-time CO2, temperature,
and  RH measurements were taken using a hand-
held, battery operated, TSI Q-Track (Model 8550)
IAQ monitor.  This portable monitor uses a non-
dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR) sensor to
measure CO2 in the range of 0-5000 parts per
million (ppm).  It is capable of measuring
temperature in the range of 32 to 122°F, with an
accuracy of 1°F. This instrument also measures
RH in the range of 5 to 95%, with an accuracy of
±3%.  Temperature and RH measurements were
also collected and logged for a continuous 24-hour
Page 2
Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0283-2823
period using HOBO H8 Pro Series loggers.  These
battery-operated loggers use an internal
temperature sensor and external RH sensor.  The
operating range is -22 to 122°F for temperature
and 0 to 100% RH.
Moisture measurements were collected along the
floor and drywall near the exterior perimeter of
the building using a non-destructive Tramex
Moisture Encounter (Tramex Ltd., Shankill, Co.
Dublin, Ireland).  This meter operates by using
low-frequency electronic transmitters (5-25
kilohertz [kHz]).  When moisture is present the
resistance decreases and the meter displays a
signal.  Additional moisture incursion
measurements were collected using a Delmhorst
Instrument Company Moisture Tester, Model BD-
9.  This meter provides direct readings for
moisture content in the range of 8 to 50% on
wood.  A reference scale is used for comparative
readings on non-wood materials.  This portable
instrument uses the amount of electrical
conductivity in the material being tested to
determine its moisture content. 
Smoke tube tests were conducted throughout the
building to determine if the building was under
positive pressure and to test the effectiveness of
the bathroom vents.  Smoke tube tests were also
conducted in the cafeteria area to determine if the
cafeteria was under negative or positive pressure
in relation to the rest of the building.
Medical Evaluation
NIOSH physicians interviewed the three
confidential requesters by telephone.  One of the
requesters provided a list of employees with
asthma. During the site visit, 26 employees were
interviewed.  Of these 26, 9 were employees
from the list provided by the requestor, 12 were
randomly selected from a personnel phone list,
and 5 responded to an email that was sent by
management to all personnel notifying them of
our availability if they had any concerns regarding
air quality in the building and/or health
complaints related to work.  Medical records were
reviewed for three employees who reported
having been diagnosed with asthma since working
in the building and who related their symptoms to
work.
EVALUATION CRITERIA
NIOSH investigators have completed over 1,200
investigations of the occupational indoor
environment in a wide variety of non-industrial
settings.  Almost all of these investigations have
been conducted since 1979.  Overall, the
symptoms and health complaints reported by
building occupants have been diverse and usually
not suggestive of any particular medical diagnosis
or readily associated with a causative agent.
Symptoms frequently reported usually include
headaches, unusual fatigue, itching or burning
eyes, skin irritation, nasal congestion, dry or
irritated throats, and other respiratory irritations.
Typically, the workplace environment has been
implicated because workers often report that their
symptoms lessen or resolve when they leave the
building.
A number of published studies have reported a
high prevalence of symptoms among occupants of
office buildings.1,2,3,4,5 Scientists investigating
indoor environmental problems believe that there
are multiple factors contributing to building-
related occupant complaints.6,7  Among these
factors are imprecisely-defined characteristics of
HVAC systems, cumulative effects of exposure to
low concentrations of multiple chemical
pollutants, odors, elevated concentrations of
particulate matter, microbiological contamination,
and physical factors such as thermal comfort,
lighting, and noise.8,9,10,11,12,13  Design,
maintenance, and operation of HVAC systems are
critical to their proper functioning and provision
of healthy and thermally comfortable indoor
environments.  Indoor environmental pollutants
can arise from either outdoor sources or indoor
sources.
Other studies have shown that occupant
perceptions of the indoor environment are more
closely related to the occurrence of symptoms
than any measured indoor contaminant or
condition.14,15,16  Some studies have shown
relationships between psychological, social, and
Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0283-2823
Page 3
organizational factors in the workplace and the
occurrence 
of 
symptoms and comfort
complaints.16,17,18,19
Less often, an illness may be found to be
specifically related to something in the building
environment.  Some examples of potentially
building-related illnesses are allergic rhinitis,
allergic asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever, and carbon
monoxide (CO) poisoning. 
Environmental problems NIOSH investigators
have found in the non-industrial indoor
environment have included the following: poor air
quality due to ventilation system deficiencies,
overcrowding, volatile organic chemicals from
office furnishings, emissions from office
machines and from structural components of the
building and its contents, tobacco smoke,
microbiological contamination, and outside air
pollutants; comfort problems due to improper
temperature and RH conditions, poor lighting, and
unacceptable noise levels; adverse ergonomic
conditions; and job-related psychosocial stressors.
In most cases, however, these indoor
environmental problems could not be directly
linked to the health effects reported by the
building’s occupants.
Standards specific for the non-industrial indoor
environment do not exist.  NIOSH, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA), and the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH),
have published regulatory standards or
recommended limits for occupational exposures to
specific chemical and physical agents.20,21,22 With
few exceptions, pollutant concentrations observed
in non-industrial indoor environments fall well
below these published occupational standards or
recommended exposure limits.  The American
Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-
conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has published
recommended building ventilation design criteria
and thermal comfort guidelines.23,24  The ACGIH
has also developed a manual of guidelines for
approaching investigations of building-related
complaints that might be caused by airborne living
organisms or their effluents.25  
Measurements of indoor environmental
contaminants have generally not proved to be
helpful in determining the cause of symptoms and
complaints, except where there are strong or
unusual sources, or a proven relationship between
contaminants and specific building-related
illnesses.  The low-level concentrations of
particles and variable mixtures of organic
materials usually found are difficult to interpret
and usually impossible to causally link to
observed and reported health symptoms.
However, measuring ventilation and comfort
indicators such as CO2, temperature, and RH, has
proven useful in the early stages of an
investigation in providing information relative to
the proper functioning and control of HVAC
systems.  
NIOSH and the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) jointly published a manual on building air
quality, written to help prevent environmental
problems in buildings and solve problems when
they occur.26  This manual suggests that indoor
environmental quality (IEQ) is a constantly
changing interaction of a complex set of factors.
Four of the most important elements involved in
the development of IEQ problems are: (1) a source
of odors or contaminants; (2) a problem with the
design or operation of the HVAC system; (3) a
pathway between the contaminant source and the
location of the complaint; and (4) the building
occupants.  A basic understanding of these factors
is critical to preventing, investigating, and
resolving IEQ problems. 
Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
CO2 is a normal constituent of exhaled breath, and
if monitored at equilibrium concentrations in a
building, may be useful as a screening technique
to evaluate whether adequate quantities of fresh
air are being introduced into an occupied space.
The American National Standards Institute
(ANSI)/ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, Ventilation
for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, recommends
outdoor air supply rates of 20 cubic feet per
Page 4
Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0283-2823
minute per person (cfm/person) for office spaces
and conference rooms, 15 cfm/person for
reception 
areas, 
classrooms, 
libraries,
auditoriums, and corridors, and 60 cfm/person for
smoking lounges.  Maintaining the recommended
ASHRAE outdoor air supply rates when the
outdoor air is of good quality, and there are no
significant indoor emission sources, should
provide for acceptable IAQ.
CO2 is not considered a building air pollutant, but
CO2 concentration is used as an indicator of the
adequacy of outside air supplied to occupied
areas.  Indoor CO2 concentrations are normally
higher than the generally constant ambient CO2
concentration (range 300-350 ppm).  ASHRAE
Standard 62-1989 recommends 1,000 ppm as the
upper limit for comfort (odor) reasons.23  When
indoor CO2 concentrations exceed 800 ppm in
areas where the only known source is exhaled
breath, inadequate ventilation is suspected.27
Elevated CO2 concentrations suggest that other
indoor contaminants may also be increased.  It is
important to note that CO2 is not an effective
indicator of ventilation adequacy if the ventilated
area is not occupied at its usual level when the
measurements are made.
Temperature and Relative
Humidity
Temperature and RH measurements are often
collected as part of an IEQ investigation because
these parameters affect the perception of comfort
in an indoor environment.  The perception of
thermal comfort is related to one’s metabolic heat
production, the transfer of heat to the
environment, physiological adjustments, and body
temperatures.28  Heat transfer from the body to the
environment is influenced by factors such as
temperature, humidity, air movement, personal
activities, and clothing.  The ASHRAE Standard
55-1992, specifies conditions in which 80% or
more of the occupants would be expected to find
the environment thermally comfortable.24 
Work-Related Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
airways characterized by symptoms of
breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness, and
coughing, that is at least partially reversible with
pharmacologic agents or time.  Genetics play a
large role in the development of asthma,
accounting for 30-80% of the asthma risk, with
the rest apparently related to environmental
exposures.29  Asthma is a common diagnosis in
both adults and children, with an estimated 17.3
million individuals in the United States having
asthma in 1998.30  
Work-related asthma (WRA) is asthma
attributable to, or made worse by, exposures in the
workplace.  There are two categories of WRA,
occupational asthma (OA) and work-aggravated
asthma (WAA).31  WAA is symptomatic asthma
that is worsened by workplace exposures.  OA is
new-onset asthma caused by exposures at work.
OA, which affects only a portion of an exposed
population, develops after a latent period ranging
from months to years.  The symptoms of OA
usually occur within minutes of exposure but may
also occur several hours after exposure.
Symptoms of OA usually get worse as the
workweek continues, but improve on weekends
and vacations.  As OA progresses, recovery may
take days to weeks.32
RESULTS
Industrial Hygiene
Evidence of water damage was observed on one
ceiling tile located on the west side of the
building.  (Building maintenance was informed of
the tile location so that they could determine the
source of the moisture and replace the tile.)  Other
areas where moisture incursion would likely occur
(along exterior walls and around windows and
entrances) were checked for moisture content.
Moisture measurements did not indicate any
chronic water incursion.  Visible active fungal
growth was not observed on any building

materials.  Visual inspection indicated that general
housekeeping was appropriate. 
The HVAC units were recently switched from a
manual adjustment system to a computer-
controlled system.  During our evaluation, the
computer-controlled system had the outside air
intakes (for the units on the roof) adjusted to 10%.
However, the units were actually closed.  The
computer-controlled system was fairly new and
had not been accurately calibrated.  Maintenance
personnel were working on the system during the
evaluation to fix the disparity.
Inspection of the HVAC units did not reveal any
visible microbial contamination.  However, some
of the HVAC units (# 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8) had
standing water in the condensate drip pans with
some visible rust.  The outside air intakes for
HVAC units #4 and #5 were located in close
proximity to bathroom exhaust vents on the roof
(see Figure 1).  Depending upon the wind
directions, there may be opportunities for the
bathroom exhaust odors to be entrained into the
outside air intakes of units #4 and #5 .  
The smoke tube tests indicated that the building
was under positive pressure.  Positive pressure
inside the building reduces the possibility of
unfiltered/unconditioned air and outside water
vapor from penetrating the building.  The cafeteria
was under negative pressure, which helps keep
odors from this area from being disseminated into
work spaces.  The smoke test also identified a
bathroom vent (near the main entrance of the
building) that was not operating. 
Tables 1 and 2 present the CO2 measurements
inside and outside the building on July 12, 2000.
CO2 measurements were made in 24 locations in
the morning and afternoon.  During the morning,
the CO2 concentrations inside the building ranged
from 435 ppm to 769 ppm with a mean of 570
ppm.  CO2 measurements obtained from the same
locations in the afternoon ranged from 780 ppm to
1,006 ppm, with a mean of 880 ppm.  All CO2
concentrations inside the building in the morning
were below the NIOSH recommeded criteria of
800 ppm.  In the afternoon, 20 of the 24
measurements inside the building had CO2
concentrations that exceeded the NIOSH
recommended criteria of 800 ppm.  CO2
concentrations outside the building ranged from
293 to 353 ppm in the morning, and from 270 to
360 ppm in the afternoon, with means of 320 ppm
and 310 ppm, respectively.
Comfort Parameters
Tables 1 and 2 present the temperature and RH
measurements inside the building.  There were
some deviations outside the recommended
temperature range, however the majority of
temperature and RH measurements were  within
a range in which 80% or more of the occupants
would be expected to find the environment
thermally comfortable (ASHRAE Standard
55–1992.)
Figures 2-5 graphically illustrate the temperature
variations over a 24–hour period (measured with
the HOBO Pro Series loggers) at different
locations.  These figures illustrate variation in
temperature from data loggers placed in areas that
are serviced by different AHUs during occupied
and unoccupied hours.  The area of the building
serviced by AHU #2 (see Figure 2) had
temperatures ranging between 71.8 - 76.6°F
during occupied hours.  In the area serviced by
AHU #3 (see Figure 3), the temperatures ranged
from 68.3 to 74°F, and in the area serviced by
AHU #5 (see Figure 4) the temperatures ranged
from 71.7 to 75.9°F.  The area of the building that
is serviced by AHU # 7 (see Figure 5) had
temperatures ranging from 69 to 75.2°F during
occupied hours. 
Medical
Thirteen of the 29 persons interviewed reported a
physician diagnosis of asthma.  Seven reported
being diagnosed with asthma prior to working at
RSC; of these, two reported no change in
symptoms related to presence in the workplace,
two reported an occasional increase in symptoms
related to odors or dust in the building, and three
reported a consistent increase in symptoms related
to presence in the workplace.  Of the six
Page 6
Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0283-2823
diagnosed since beginning work at RSC, two
reported no change in symptoms related to
presence in the workplace, one noted
an occasional increase in symptoms if the copiers
were being used extensively, and three reported a
consistent increase in symptoms related to
presence in the workplace.   
In addition to asthma, 10 of the 29 employees
interviewed reported upper respiratory symptoms
or mucous membrane irritation temporally related
to the work environment.  Ten of the 29 reported
having positive allergy tests for dust mites.  Four
employees reported no symptoms related to work.
Medical records were obtained for the three
individuals who reported both being diagnosed
with asthma since beginning work at the RSC and
having a consistent increase in symptoms related
to being at work.  One of the three had
information in the medical record possibly
consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, but no
evidence of a decrement in lung function at work;
two did not have documented evidence of asthma.
Among the 29 persons interviewed, the most
frequently reported observation was that the work
environment was dusty and the cloth-covered
cubicles were dirty.  Several persons complained
of odors from the kitchen.  In addition, several
persons reported the use of ozone generating air
cleaners at their desks.
DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS
This evaluation did not reveal the existence of
microbial reservoirs or suggest a chronic water
incursion problem in the building.  A water-
damaged ceiling tile was found.  
Smoke tube tests revealed that the building was
maintained under a positive pressure with respect
to the outdoor environment.  Thus, contaminants
and moisture from outdoors should not enter the
RSC building through open doors or penetrations
in the building envelope.
Smoke tests indicated that the cafeteria was under
negative pressure relative to the rest of the
building.  Keeping the cafeteria under negative
pressure will help prevent odors from entering the
rest of the building.  Smoke tests conducted in the
women’s bathroom near the main entrance of the
building indicated that this room was under
positive pressure, and that the exhaust fan was not
operating. 
CO2 measurements 
above 
the 
NIOSH
recommended criteria of 800 ppm indicate that the
HVAC system is not providing enough outdoor air
to the occupied areas.  The HVAC system should
be capable of maintaining outdoor air supply rates
of at least 20 cfm/person for office spaces.23  The
current AHUs utilize computer– controlled,
variable-air-volume boxes to control temperature
and the amount of outdoor air brought into the
building.  During our evaluation, the computer-
controlled system needed to be adjusted so that
the setting for the outside air intakes on the
computer matched the actual outside air damper
adjustments on the HVAC units.  Previously, CO2
concentrations were measured in the building by
consultants.  These data indicated that CO2
concentrations were below 800 ppm inside the
building when the outside air intakes were set
higher than 15%.  Based on that previous survey,
a minimum damper setting (>15%) should be
established to ensure that an adequate amount of
outdoor air is supplied to the building at all times.
Two of the HVAC units (unit #4 and #5) had
outside air intakes near bathroom exhaust fans.
This allows odors from the exhaust fans to be
entrained into the HVAC units.  The HVAC units
appeared to be clean and have good air filtration
systems.  Some of the condensate pans had
evidence of standing water and rust.  Condensate
pans should allow for good drainage to prevent
standing water and rust inside the HVAC systems.
Asthma was reported by several persons, and
some of these felt that symptoms were related to
the work environment.  Two of three medical
records reviewed from employees who reported a
physician diagnosis of asthma did not support a
diagnosis of asthma.  Ten persons reported upper
Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0283-2823
Page 7
respiratory symptoms or mucous membrane
irritation temporally related to the work
environment. 
Based on medical interviews, a commonly
reported concern was the dust in the work
environment.  Several employees had allergy
testing that indicated allergies to dust mites.  Dust
mites of the genus Dermatophagoides are the
most important source of allergens in house dust,
and there is sufficient evidence in the medical
literature to show a causal relationship between
dust mite allergen exposure and asthma
exacerbations in sensitized individuals.  Dust
mites require four things to thrive: sites for
nesting, such as carpet, upholstered furniture,
mattresses, and bedding; the presence of humans
whose skin scales provide a food source;
temperature optimal for growth; and humidity.
Dust mite levels can be reduced by removing
carpets or treating them with benzyl benzoate,
eliminating or reducing upholstered furnishings or
replacing them with leather, plastic, or other
smooth-surfaced materials, 
reducing or
eliminating unnecessary fabrics such as draperies,
and lowering humidity.33
Several employees reported the use of personal air
cleaners (i.e., portable ion-generating and
electrostatic precipitator devices).  There is
limited evidence that particle air cleaners are
associated with a reduction in asthma symptoms.33
In addition, ion-generating air cleaners and
electrostatic precipitators can produce ozone in
significant quantities.34  Ozone is a mucous
membrane and lung irritant.  Exposure to ozone is
associated with measurable decreases in lung
function.  Such exposure also results in increased
responsiveness of the airways to nonspecific
stimuli.  Symptoms include cough, chest pain,
shortness of breath, throat irritation, and
wheezing.  These effects are self–limited.35  
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The predetermined computer setting should
periodically be compared with the actual
adjustment of the outside air damper on the
HVAC units during preventive maintenance
inspections.  A minimum damper setting of 15%
should be established to ensure that an adequate
amount of outdoor air is supplied.
2. The AHU condensate pans should be cleaned
and adjusted to allow for good drainage.
3. The outside air intakes of HVAC units #4
and #5 should be relocated to avoid entraining
bathroom exhaust fan emissions.  
4. All bathroom exhaust fans should be checked
periodically.  If not operating properly, they
should be fixed to meet original design
specifications. 
5. The water–damaged ceiling tile noted during
our evaluation should be discarded.  As a general
rule, all porous water- or mold-damaged material
that cannot be dried within 24 to 48 hours should
be discarded.  Attempts to clean or disinfect
mold–contaminated porous materials are generally
unsuccessful.  Any identified sources of excessive
moisture or leaks that may cause water damage to
the building’s interior or furnishings should be
promptly eliminated.  Any episodes of water
incursion should be dealt with promptly.  Water
should be removed immediately from porous,
water–damaged furnishings, carpets, and
construction materials.  Heat fans should be used
within 24 hours to dry carpets and other
applicable surfaces.  Steam or other water-based
cleaning methods which add moisture to the
environment must be used with extreme care.  A
written program for dealing with water incursion
and IAQ incidents should be implemented.  
6. References regarding a written program to
deal with IAQ issues include the “Building Air
Quality Action Plan,”36 and the “Building Air
Quality – A Guide for Building Owners and
Facility Managers.”37  The “Building Air Quality
Action Plan” is particularly useful for the
implementation of an effective IEQ management
program.  These documents contain some of the
best practical advice available regarding the
prevention, evaluation, and correction of IEQ
problems.

with work-related health concerns should be
encouraged to report these concerns to the
appropriate management personnel, and should
consult their health care provider to determine the
cause and proper treatment.
