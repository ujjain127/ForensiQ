An advanced high bypass ratio fan model was tested in the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center 9 £
15 Foot
Low-Speed Wind Tunnel. The primary focus of this test was to quantify the acoustic bene ts and aerodynamic
performance of sweep and lean in stator vane design. Three stator sets were used for this test series. A conventional
radial stator set was tested at two rotor–stator axial spacings. Additional stator sets incorporating sweep only and
sweep and lean were also tested. The hub axial location for the swept-and-leaned and swept-only stators was at the
sameaxiallocationasthe radialstatorat the smallerrotor–statorspacing(upstream statorlocation), whilethe tip of
these modi ed stators was at the sameaxiallocation as the radialstator set at the downstream rotor–stator spacing.
The acoustic data show that swept and leaned stators give signi cant reductions in both rotor–stator interaction
noise and broadband noise beyond what could be achieved through increased axial spacing of the conventional,
radial stator. Application of these test results to a representative two-engine aircraft and  ight path suggest that
about a 3 effective perceived noise (EPN) dB fan noise reduction could be achieved through incorporation of these
modi ed stators. This reduction would represent a signi cant portion of the 6-EPNdB aircraft noise reduction goal
relative to that of 1992 technology levels of the current NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology initiative.
Introduction
A
MAJOR source of aircraft engine noise comes from the inter-
action of the rotor viscous wakes with the fan exit guide vanes
or stators.The most prominentcomponentsof this interactionnoise
are tones at multiples of the rotor blade passage frequency (BPF),
although there also exists a broadband component of this rotor–
stator noise. Traditional methods of reducing this interaction noise
have been to select blade/vane ratios to satisfy the cutoff criterion
for propagation of the fundamental rotor tone1 and increased axial
spacing between the rotor and stator.2 Increased rotor–stator axial
spacingmay degradethe fan aerodynamicperformanceand increase
the overall engine weight.
Stator vane lean and/or sweep have been suggested as a mech-
anism to reduce the severity of the rotor wake interaction with the
stator vane. Vane sweep is the axial displacement of the vane with
radius such that the tip region is farther downstream than the hub.
Correspondingly,lean is a circumferentialdisplacementof the vane
stacking line relative to the radial direction. Both of these stator
modi cations have been proposed as a means to reduce the stator
response to the rotor  ow by reducing the rotor–stator acoustic re-
sponse. Rotor–stator tone generation is thought to be a function of
the numberof rotorwakeintersectionson the statorvanes.The num-
berofwake intersectionsis increasedwith statorleaninthe direction
of fan rotation. Aft-swept stators achieve a similar effect through
increasedrotor–stator separationtoward the tip regionand,thus, de-
layed rotor wake intersection toward the stator tip. Kazen3 demon-

in the two BPF tone from 1.5 to 3.5 dB with the leaned stator were
observed in this study.
Analytical studies4 have suggested that both stator lean and
sweep, if properly applied, may signi cantly reduce rotor–stator
interactiontone noise.Optimal statorlean and sweep offers the pos-
sibility of reducing the overall engine weight through decreased
axial rotor–stator spacing or achieving additional tone noise reduc-
tion for a particular rotor–stator spacing.
An advanced high bypass subsonic fan model incorporatingsta-
tor sweep and lean was designed and built by the Allison Engine
Company (Ref. 5) under contractto NASA John H. Glenn Research
Center. This fan was tested in the NASA John H. Glenn Research
Center 9 by 15-Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel6¡8 (9 £ 15 LSWT).
These fan tests were conducted at a freestream Mach number of
0.10. The test section walls are acousticallytreated to provide ane-
choic conditions down to a frequency of 250 Hz, which is lower
than the range of test fan acoustic tones.
The emphasis of this fan test was to evaluate the aeroacoustic
performanceof the swept-and-leanedstator and the swept-onlysta-
tor relative to that of a baseline radial stator. All stators had the
same vane number and were designed for equivalent aerodynamic
performance.Acousticdata are presentedin terms of sidelinedirec-
tivitiesandspectra.Thesedatawerealsousedtogenerate yoverand

representativetwo-engineaircraftand  ightpathto give an estimate
of the fan EPNL benet associated with these stator modi cations.
Description of Fan Test
Research Fan
Figure1 showstheresearchfaninstalledin the 9 £ 15 LSWT. The
ultrahigh bypass (UHB) drive rig was used to drive the Allison fan.
The UHB drive rig was powered by a high-pressureair turbinedrive
with the drive air and instrumentationsupplied through the support
strut. The drive turbine exhaustair was ducteddownstreamthrough
an acoustically treated diffuser and exited the end of the treated
test section. There was little indication of acoustic contamination
of the aft fan data from the turbine exhaust. The fan was tested
at a freestream Mach number of 0.10 in the test section, which is
suf cienttoachieveacoustic ighteffect9 and providesacousticdata
representativeof takeoff/approachoperation.All data were taken at
0-deg fan axis angle of attack.

would have been desirable, but was dropped from the program due
to budget considerations. All stator sets had 42 vanes and were
designed for equivalent fan stage aerodynamic performance. The
fan stage did not have a core  ow simulation. The baseline stator
con guration was the radial stator at the closer, upstream rotor–
stator axial spacing, (Fig. 2). The fan was also tested at a larger
rotor–stator axial spacing (downstream) position. The swept-and-
leaned and the swept only-stators were designed such that the hub
was locatedat the same axial location as the baselinestator location
for the smaller rotor–stator spacing, and the tip was located at the
axial location correspondingto the radial stator at the higher rotor–
stator spacing (Fig. 3). These stators were designed with 30 deg of
sweepand 30 deg of lean.The swept-and-leanedstatorswere leaned
in the direction of rotor rotation.

Anechoic Wind Tunnel and Acoustic Instrumentation
The tunneltest section walls,  oor and ceilinghad acoustic treat-
ment to produce an anechoic test environment. Figure 7 shows
the test fan installed in the 9 £ 15 LSWT. Sideline acoustic data
were acquired with a computer-controlledtranslating microphone
probe (also seen in the photograph of Fig. 1) and with three aft
microphone assemblies mounted to the tunnel  oor. The translat-
ing microphoneprobe acquired data at 48 sidelinegeometricangles
from 27.2 to 134.6 deg relative to the fan inlet axis. The translating
microphone probe traversed near the tunnel wall at 227 cm (89 in.)

Results and Discussion
Aerodynamic Performance
Aerodynamic performance for the fan and the four stator vane
con gurations(radialupstream,radialdownstream,swept-only,and
swept-and-leaned) on the fan acoustic operating line are presented
in Figs. 8–10. The hardware design intent was that the fan perfor-
mance would not be affected by the stator vane con guration and
that the three different stator vane sets operate to the same level
of performance. The fan and stator vane performance was deter-
mined from fan weight  ow and force balance measurements. Fan
performance for each of the stator vane con gurations is shown in
Figs. 8 and 9 as corrected fan weight  ow and corrected fan torque
as a function of corrected fan speed, respectively.Corrected in this

case means the data are normalizedto standard day conditions.The
results indicate that the fan was operating very nearly the same for
each stator vane con guration.
In Fig. 8, differences in corrected fan weight  ow are on the or-
der of §0:5–0.75%, with the radial stator vane in the downstream
position showing the highest weight  ow and the swept-and-leaned
con guration showing the lowest. Accuracy of the fan weight  ow
measurements is §0:5%. In Fig. 9, differences in corrected fan
torque, which is a measure of the work produced, between stator

vane con gurations are negligible. Force balance torque measure-
ments are accurate to §0:35% of full scale, or §5 ft.lb. No force
balance data were available for the aft baseline stator vane con-
 guration. Figure 10 shows the corrected stator vane thrust from
force balancedata as a functionof correctedfan speed.Again, force
balance data were available for the radial stator in the downstream
position,but it is assumed that because the same stator vane geom-
etry was used that the forces produced by the radial stator in the
downstream position are nearly the same. The results show that the
radial stator vanes produced a larger amount of thrust than either
the swept-only or swept-and-leaned stator vanes across the entire
operatingline. At lower speeds, the swept-only and the swept-and-
leaned stator vanes performance is nearly the same, but lower than
the radialstatorvaneperformance.As the fan speedincreased,larger
differences between stator vanes can be seen, with the swept-and-
leaned stator vanes producingthe lowest thrust and the radial stator
vanes the highest thrust. At 100% corrected fan speed (full power),
the swept-only stator vanes produced about 4.5% less thrust and
the swept-and-leanedstator vanes produced about 7.5% less thrust
compared with the radial stator vanes. The accuracy of the force
balance data is §0:4% of full scale, or §8 lb.
The results demonstrate a higher loss associated with the swept-
only and the swept-and-leanedstator vanes,typicallyviscouslosses
in the hub and tip regionsassociatedwith the corner ows at the sta-
tor vane/ ow surface interface. These  ows are increasingly com-
plex for the swept-and-leaned stator vane case, with tight corner
areas as a result of the stator vane lean, which cause a local increase
in blockageand increase in losses. The fan weight  ow results sup-
port this result, especially for the swept-and-leaned stator vanes.
The larger corner losses produce higher duct losses, reducing the
nozzle exit area and, hence, reducing the fan weight  ow at a given
fan speed compared with the radial stator vanes.

angles for the sideline translating microphone probe covered the
range25–130deg,and the three xed microphoneswere at emission
angles of 136, 147, and 158 deg. This angular range was suf cient
to de ne the sideline noise directivity patterns for subsequent fan
EPNL calculations.
Digital acousticdata were processedas constantbandwidthspec-
tra. Spectra were acquired and averaged at each translating mi-
crophone probe or  xed microphone position with 6- and 59-Hz
bandwidths. These constant bandwidth spectra were electronically
merged and used to generate one-third octave spectra.
Swept-and-leaned and swept-only stators were expected to re-
duce rotor–stator interaction tones by relieving the severity of the
rotor wake interactionwith the stator vanes.An additionalobserved
benet was a reduction in fan broadband noise.
EPNL
The EPNL was the noise metric used to rank the relative noise
levels produced by the three stator sets. EPNLs were analytically
derivedfromthe measuredfan rig one-thirdoctavebandsoundpres-
sure level data, and they are a function of frequency, duration,tone
content,andsource–observergeometry.A 3.5 linearscalefactorwas
applied to all sound pressurelevel test data. EPNLs were calculated
for each stator set using two methods: The  rst method used the
measured noise spectra with no modi cations, whereas the second
1134

method used the noise spectra with the tones at the BPF and its
harmonics electronicallyremoved. The former method was used to
estimate fan EPNLs with both broadbandand tonecontent,whereas
the latter method was used to estimate fan EPNLs with broadband
noise components only. No other noise sources were considered in
these calculations.
A notionaltwinjetaircraftwas used as the basis for the fan EPNL
calculations. This aircraft was assumed to have a  eld length of
2740 m (9000 ft), a climbout angle of 9 deg and n altitude over the
communityobserverof 550m (1800 ft). The aircraftclimboutspeed
was assumed to be 311 m/s (160 kn). No correctionwas made to the
source noise levels due to the differencein convectiveampli cation
between the tunnel conditions and the assumed  ight speed of the
notional aircraft.
Propagation effects considered included spherical spreading, at-
mospheric attenuation, ground re ections, and extra ground atten-
uation. Sideline and community EPNL calculationswere made us-
ing procedures commensurate with the requirements described in
Ref. 10. EPNL calculationswere made every 30.5 m (100 ft) along
the 450-m (1476-ft) sideline to ensure that the sideline EPNL re-
ported captured the maximum level. Community EPNLs were car-
ried out for an observer 6500 m (21,325 ft) from brake release on
the runway centerline. The computer code documented in Ref. 11
was used to help model the aircraft trajectory, propagation effects,
and noise metric calculations.
Figure 11 shows the aircraft EPNL on the 450-m (1476-ft) side-
line. Althoughthe throttlesettingusedat takeoffwouldbe at or near
the fan design speed, the sideline noise is evaluated for the range
of speeds investigated for illustrative purposes. There is about a
1.5-EPNdB decrease associated with moving the radial stator from
the upstream position to the downstream position at all fan speeds
except 110% of design, where the change in noise level is negligi-
ble. However, the addition of sweep and lean or sweep only results
in about a 3-EPNdB reduction from noise levels relative to that for
the upstream radial stator at fan speeds up to about 75% of design.
The sweep-only stator maintains this 3-EPNdb reduction relative
to baseline in the midspeed range of 75–95% design speed. The
swept-and-leanedstator showed the most noise reduction at design
and above fan speeds. Similar results are seen for  yover EPNL
calculations. The use of a range of fan speeds is more applicable
for  yover EPNL because a throttle cutback is often used in that
segment. The analytical EPNL predictions for sideline and  yover

observers differ due to geometric inputs to the extra ground attenu-
ation and ground re ection models. These differences,however, do
not signi cantly affect the trends with respect to fan speed. Thus,
although the magnitudes of the sideline and  yover EPNLs are, of
course, different, the trends are nearly identical.
The relativelypoorperformanceof the swept-and-leanedstatorat
fan speeds near 90% design may be explainedby the lower aerody-
namic performanceofthatstator.Pressurelossesassociatedwith the
swept-and-leanedstator are thought to arise from less than optimal
 ow nearthe huband tip regions.It is quitepossiblethatre nements
in the aerodynamicdesign of the swept-and-leanedstator would re-
sult in improved performance for this concept throughout the fan
speed range.
The theoretical study of Ref. 4 was a tone-based comparison,
which did not include broadband effects. In Ref. 4, it is concluded
that sweep should be most bene cial at takeoff conditions,whereas
lean should be most bene cial at approach conditions. The data
results of Fig. 11, which of course include broadband noise, are
only marginally supportive of this prediction. In Ref. 12, which
reconciles the present test results with the theory of Ref. 4, there
is recognition that the predicted tone bene ts are only valid when
the tone levels are above broadband. It would appear from the data
that sweep alone, rather than sweep and lean, achieved essentially
all of the noise reduction at the lower fan speeds. At the higher
fan speeds,additionalnoise reductionwas achievedwith sweep and
lean beyond what was observed by sweep only. However, it is clear
from Fig. 11, that incorporation of stator sweep and lean results
in signi cant noise reductions throughout the fan operating range
relative to what could be achieved through simply increasing the
axial spacing of the radial stator.
Sound Pressure Level Directivities
Sideline sound pressure level (SPL) directivitiesprovidea useful
tool for evaluating acoustic differences associated with changes in
the stator con guration. These directivitieswere achieved by com-
bining results from the traverse microphone and the three aft  xed
microphones, resulting in 227-cm (89-in.) sideline directivities for
25–158 deg emission angles relative to the fan upstream axis and
centered on the fan rotor plane.
Figure 12 shows representativeSPL directivitiesfor the four test
con gurations.These resultsare for the fan operatingat 50% speed.
These data are for the two BPF tone,which falls within the 3150-Hz
one-thirdoctaveband.Advancedhigh bypassratiofans,such as that
reportedherein,tend to haveaft-dominateddirectivities.The results
of Fig. 12 clearly show that there is a signi cant noise reduction
associated with increased radial stator spacing and additional noise
benets due to the swept-and-leanedand swept-only stator.
The noise reduction trends shown in Fig. 12 are more easily
understood in terms of changes in noise level relative to that ob-
served for the baseline radial stator in the upstream position. The

SPL directivitiesfor the fourstatorcon gurationswere examinedin
this manner at four representativefan speeds. Constant bandwidth
(59-Hz) spectra were used for this analysis to facilitate separation
of the rotor-stator interaction tone from adjacent broadband noise.
Table 2 lists the test conditions examined.
Results for each test speed are presented in terms of representa-
tive spectra at a 126-deg emission angle, followed by directivities
showing the tone and broadband reductions relative to noise levels
observed for the baseline radial stator in the upstream axial posi-
tion. The broadband levels at rotor–stator interaction frequencies
were determined by interpolating spectral levels in the region of
the interaction tone. That is, the broadband levels at the interaction
tones were inferred from typical broadband levels on either side of
the tone frequencies. Broadband levels determined by this manual
procedure should be accurate within 0.5 dB.
Figure 13 compares spectra acquired at 126-deg emission angle
along the 227-cm (89-in.) sideline for the fan operating at 50%
design speed. The fundamental rotor–stator interaction tone (BPF)
is cut off and essentially not present in the spectra. Strong two BPF
and three BPF tones are evidentfor the radial stator in the upstream
position.These harmonicsare attenuatedeitherby movingtheradial
stator to the aft position or employing sweep and/or lean. However,
there is clear indication of broadband noise reduction, on the order
of 4 dB, by the modi ed stator sets.
Figure 14 shows the directivity effects on the two BPF fan tone
band. SPL reductions in the tone and broadband levels are plotted
againstthe directivityangle. Negative valuesrepresentnoise reduc-
tions relative to what was observed for the baseline con guration
with the radial stator in the upstream position. Tone reductions are
greatestat aft angles,showingup to 12-dBreductionassociatedwith
moving the radial stator to the downstream location. Noise reduc-
tions of up to 15 and 19 dB were associated, respectively,with the
swept-only and the swept-and-leanedstator.
Moving the radial stator to the downstream location produced
little to no reduction in broadband noise. This result is consistent
with that reportedin the stator spacingstudy of Ref. 2, where it was
also noted that there was little change in broadbandnoise level with
(radial) stator spacing. The swept-and-leaned and the swept-only
stators showed up to 4-dB broadband noise reduction.

There has been some concernregardingthe periodicnatureof the
tonal directivity data taken in the 9 £ 15 LSWT. Although it is pos-
sible that this behaviorarises from tunnelwall re ections,it is much
more likely that the data accuratelyshow a real interferencepattern
between aft- and forward-radiated noise at a particular frequency.
There are several observationsto support the second interpretation.
The fan is aft dominated; therefore, one would expect the inter-
ference pattern to be more pronounced toward the forward angles
where the relative noise levels are more nearly equal in level. This
is, in fact, what is observedin the sideline data. An analyticalstudy
of predicted sideline noise levels was performed that considered a
case for inlet and exhaustradiationfor an aft-dominatedfan. Again,
a similar noise interference pattern was observed for these analyt-
ical results. Finally, unpublished results for another advanced fan
model, which was tested in a large anechoicfreejetfacility,showed
similar interferencein the sideline results; in this case there was no
nearby tunnel wall to provide possible re ections.

fan operating at 84% design speed. The spectral overlay of Fig. 15
is similar to the 50% speed resultsof Fig. 10 in that the fundamental

tone is essentially cut off, and most overtone energy is associated
with the radial stator in the upstream position. The haystacking
nature of the swept-and-leanedspectra near three BPF may be as-
sociated with  ow disturbancescaused by the poorer aerodynamic
performance of that stator.
Figure 16 shows sideline noise reductions for the two BPF tone
and broadband. The swept-and-leaned and the swept-only stators
were essentially equivalent in terms of tonal noise reduction. Tone
reductions associated with the radial stator in the downstream po-
sition were almost as good as those for the modi ed stators except
for downstream sideline angles beyond 100 deg. Broadband noise
reductions for the modi ed stators were about 2 dB at upstream
angles, increasing to 4–5 dB at farther aft angles.
The fundamentalrotor–stator interactiontone remained cut off at
100% design speed (Fig. 17). However, higher-ordertones are now

The swept-and-leanedstator had much more effectthan the radial
stator in the downstream position for reducing two BPF tone noise
at 100% fan speed (Fig. 18). However, there was essentially no
associated broadband reduction at two BPF.
All stator con gurations produced signicant tone noise at the
110% overspeed condition. The fundamental rotor–stator interac-
tion tone is now weakly cut on and is evident for the radial stator
at the two axial locations and for the swept-only stator. However,
this tone is not evident for the swept-and-leaned stator (Fig. 19).
The swept-and-leaned stator essentially eliminated the two BPF
and three BPF tones from the spectra. The swept-only stator was

Sideline constant bandwidth (59-Hz) directivities at two BPF
showing noise reduction relative to the baseline (radial, upstream) con-
 guration (110% fan design speed).
The two BPF tone directivity results of Fig. 20 likewise show
signi cant noise reductions associated with the swept-and-leaned
stator, with somewhat less attenuation (relative to the radial stator
in the forward position) seen for the swept-only stator and radial
stator in the downstreamposition.The broadbandlevels at two BPF
were slightly lower for the swept-and-leanedstator at upstream di-
rectivity angles. Reductions in broadband level were typically seen
for all stator sets relative to the baseline stator con guration at aft
directivity angles, especially in the 115–130 deg range.
These results for the constant bandwidth tone and broadband di-
rectivities are consistent with those presented earlier for the repre-
sentative aircraft effective perceived noise levels (Fig. 11). Stators
incorporating sweep and lean, or possibly sweep only, have been
shown to reduce signi cantly both rotor–stator interactiontone and
broadband noise levels. However, the acoustic results are not con-
sistent as to whether sweep and lean or sweep only is the preferred
design. Sweep-and-lean and sweep-only stators provide additional
noise reduction relative to the radial stator in the downstream po-
sition; however, sweep only is more effective at lower fan speeds
whereas sweep and lean provides somewhat more noise attenua-
tion at higher fan speeds at and above design. This conclusion is
further complicated by the observation that the swept-and-leaned
stator showed greateraerodynamiclosses than did the other stators,
suggesting that its acoustic performance, likewise, was compro-
mised.On the other hand, one could infer that the expectedacoustic
bene ts of a better designed swept-and-leaned stator would be at
least as good as that shown herein and perhaps better.
Data Repeatability
The modi ed stator sets showed signi cant reductionsin fan tone
levels;therefore,there is a need to validatethe repeatabilityof these
results. Repeat data runs for the swept-and-leaned stator and the
radial stator in the downstream position were made to quantify re-
peatability of the acoustic data. In each instance, the second set of
data represent a fan rebuild and was acquired at a totally differ-
ent test time. Thus, these comparisons were rather rigorous toward
validating the acoustic data.

Conclusions
The results clearlyshowed that incorporationof stator sweep and
lean or sweep only can signi cantly reduce rotor–stator tone levels.
Tone levels for the modi ed stators were signicantly reduced be-
yondwhatwasachievedby simplyrelocatingtheconventionalradial
stator to the downstream location, with maximum noise reduction
benets typically observed at downstream directivity angles. It is
not clear if stator sweep alone is adequate to achieve substantial
reductions in rotor–stator interaction noise, or if there are signi -
cant additionalbene ts to be realized through incorporationof both
sweep and lean. In particular, the aerodynamic performance of the
swept-and-leaned stator showed somewhat higher losses than that
of the other stators,suggestingthat noise reductionsassociatedwith
this stator may be furtherimproved through enhancedaerodynamic
design of a swept-and-leanedstator.
Increased axial spacing of a conventional radial stator has lit-
tle impact on the fan broadband noise level, except, perhaps, to
increase the potential for broadband noise generation through in-
creased scrubbing surface, etc. However, the results for the swept-
and-leaned and the swept-only stators reported herein did show a
signi cant reduction (often on the order of 4 dB) of the broadband
noise relative to that generated with the radial stator.
Acoustic results scaled to a representative two-engine aircraft
and  ight path suggested that about 3-EPNdB fan noise reduction
could be realized through incorporationof these modi ed stators, a
result which could representa signi cant part of the current NASA
Advanced Subsonic Technology initiative goal of a 6-EPNdB fan
noise reduction relative to 1992 technology levels.
These results suggest that incorporation of some combination
of stator sweep and lean may signi cantly reduce both tone and
broadband noise levels for future advanced turbofans. Additional
research in this area is needed to quantify the aerodynamic and
aeroacousticperformanceof these stator designfeaturesand to gain
insights into methodology for additionalengine noise reduction.
