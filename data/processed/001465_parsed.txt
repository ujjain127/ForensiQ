Comments of Shared Spectrum Company 
I. Introduction 
Shared Spectrum Company (SSC) submits these comments in strong support of the 
Spectrum Sharing Innovative Test-Bed described in the two Notices issued on June 8, 2006 by 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and by the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA).1    SSC congratulates both agencies for taking the lead and 
cooperating in advancing the frontier of innovative spectrum sharing technologies through a test-
bed, which will demonstrate the benefits to all users of the spectrum by greatly increasing 
effective communications capacity.    
In establishing and implementing the test-bed, SSC recommends that the Commission 
and NTIA focus their joint and respective efforts on facilitating technological advances in 
                                                 
1 Public Notice, Federal Communications Commission Seeks Public Comment on Creation of a Spectrum Sharing 
Innovation Test-Bed, ET Docket No. 06-89, FCC 06-77 (June 8, 2006); Notice of Inquiry, The President’s Spectrum 
Policy Initiative Spectrum Sharing Innovation Test-Bed, Docket No. 060602142-6142-01, 71 Fed. Reg. 33282 (June 
8, 2006).  These comments jointly address key questions raised in both Notices. 
spectrum sharing that will have the broadest applicability across the electromagnetic spectrum 
for the benefit of a wide variety of Federal and non-Federal users.  In so doing, FCC and NTIA 
should ensure that bona fide, adequately funded entities are afforded easy access to adequate 
spectrum resources in government and non-government bands below 1 GHz through streamlined 
experimental licensing procedures and operational requirements that are flexible yet ensure 
against harmful interference to incumbent users. 
SSC is a small business that is developing dynamic spectrum management applications 
and high performance, low-cost transceivers that operate from 30 MHz to 3 GHz.2  In 2005, 
under Phase 3 of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Next Generation 
(XG) Communications program,3 Shared Spectrum was awarded a 26-month research and 
development contract to develop prototypes and demonstrate the ability to implement networks 
of spectrum-agile radios in military and urban environments with the objective of accessing 10 
times more spectrum without causing harmful interference to other users.4  These advanced, 
proven spectrum sharing technologies will enable military, public safety, critical infrastructure, 
industrial and commercial radio networks to dynamically adapt to changing spectrum needs and 
environments under the control of software-based usage policies.  SSC intends to take full 
advantage of this test-bed opportunity to further demonstrate the advantages of dynamic 
spectrum sharing.

II. Substantive Elements of the Test-Bed 
A. Technology Selection Must Focus on Dynamic Spectrum Sharing and Cognitive 
Radio Technology 
 
Both Notices provide several examples of technologies that could be considered for the 
Spectrum Sharing Innovation Test-Bed including adaptive technologies (geo-location, frequency 
avoidance, waveform detection), dynamic spectrum access techniques, cognitive radios, high-
powered broadband, new interoperable public safety technologies, smart antennas, mesh 
networking, multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems and Federal/non-Federal sharing 
techniques.  SSC suggests that the primary focus of the test-bed be on innovative, dynamic 
spectrum sharing technologies such as those currently being developed by DARPA and SSC as 
well as other cognitive radio technologies.  Promoting such innovations will not only serve the 
primary objectives of the test-bed, as articulated in the reports on the President’s Spectrum 
Policy Initiative,5 but will foster development of a wide range of broadband, military/homeland 
security and public safety applications.  Other technology advancements such as MIMO, 
advanced modulation techniques, mesh networking and adaptive antennas could also be tested 
and implemented as important ancillary components of these core dynamic sharing systems. 
The Commission and NTIA have recognized the value and promise of dynamic spectrum 
sharing and cognitive radio (CR) technologies and have taken significant steps to facilitate their 
                                                 
5 See Spectrum Policy for the 21st Century – The President’s Spectrum Policy Initiative: Report 1 Recommendations 
of the Federal Government Spectrum Task Force at 22-26 (June 2004) (“Given the increase in new and innovative 
radio communication systems seeking access to the spectrum, the most challenging issue is interference problems 
inherent in using the latest technologies.”); Spectrum Policy for the 21st Century – The President’s Spectrum Policy 
Initiative: Report 2 Recommendations From State and Local Governments and Private Sector Responders at 23 
(June 2004) (“Spectrum policymakers must not only anticipate, but must also help create an environment for 
important new technology developments.  . . . Coordinating information developed in private and federal 
laboratories would provide the technical information necessary to allow standards committees, regulators, and 
policymakers to make meaningful decisions regarding the interference and sharing potential of new technologies.”)

development and deployment.6  As the Commission stated, “[t]he advent of cognitive radios and 
associated technologies has the potential to initiate a new era in radio frequency spectrum 
utilization.  With radios that are able to recognize spectrum availability and able to negotiate 
protocols for rapid reconfiguration, these radios will employ software defined radio [SDR] 
technologies to change their operational characteristics and open new opportunities for spectrum 
use. . . .  [A]pplications such as dynamic spectrum sharing, interruptible spectrum sharing, and 
rapidly reconfigurable secondary markets in spectrum use will be attainable with cognitive 
radios.”7  NTIA clearly understands the problems confronting both government and non-
government wireless users that cognitive radios will address – “scarcity of spectrum, deployment 
difficulties, and transitioning to different technologies” – and is well aware of how “federal 
government agencies are placing an increasing emphasis on SDR and using SDR as the basic 
platform on which to build CR technology to resolve these problems. For example, through 
research projects such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) neXt 
Generation (XG) program, the Department of Defense (DOD) is investigating how advanced 
sensing, modulation, and multiple access technologies can be used with a machine-intelligible 
spectrum policy framework to enable cognitive spectrum sharing that could improve spectrum 
usage efficiency by a factor of ten or more.”8

As the current prime contractor on the DARPA XG project, SSC is already substantially 
contributing to the development of these technologies through ongoing field tests of its prototype 
wideband XG radios, but to gain adequate regulatory and market acceptance it will be necessary 
to demonstrate and evaluate various hardware and network configurations, adaptive software 
algorithms and enhanced measurement techniques in real-world situations in a variety of urban, 
suburban and rural environments.  If adequate and appropriate spectrum is expeditiously made 
available, the NTIA/FCC test-bed will allow SSC and others to immediately and significantly 
expand the development and accelerate the deployment of innovative spectrum sharing systems 
for both government and non-government users.  Accordingly, SSC proposes that the test-bed 
program focus on facilitating the further development of dynamic sharing and CR technologies.   
The NTIA Notice of Inquiry proposed eight “Selection Criteria” to evaluate and select the 
proposed technology or service to be implemented in the Test-Bed.  SSC supports this approach 
and the proposed criteria, but SSC also recommends that the following additional criteria be 
considered:  
• Whether the proposed technology is extensible to a substantial portion of the spectrum, 
not just the bands identified for the test-bed, and frequency agile over a significant 
number of potential test-bed bands; 
• Whether the proposed technology promotes flexible and symmetric use of both Federal 
and Non-Federal bands by both Federal and Non-Federal users; 
• Whether programmable radios (i.e., software defined and cognitive radios) are to be 
tested and deployed in a variety of experimental and market environments; 
• Whether the proposed technology is remotely controllable and configurable; 
• How well the proposed technology can be adapted for a variety of services and 
applications, including broadband, military/homeland security, and public safety; 
• Whether the proposed technology is able to provide meaningful innovative services; and 
• Whether the proposed technology is capable of transmissions of adequate link distances 
(e.g., up to 20 km). 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
and deployment issues that could limit the military’s broadband wireless end-to-end connectivity. Like DARPA’s 
early work on the Internet, XG-based technology will become applicable to both military and civilian applications.”) 
(footnotes omitted).

As discussed next, the candidate frequency bands for the test-bed must have propagation and 
other characteristics that will allow for varied and robust testing for broadband applications.  
Moreover, the technology and bands chosen must not create a greater risk of causing harmful 
interference to incumbent users. 
B. Candidate Frequency Bands Must be Below 1 GHz with at Least 2.5 MHz of 
Contiguous Bandwidth 
 
The FCC and NTIA Notices seek comment on the criteria that should be used in 
identifying and selecting candidate frequency band(s) for the test-bed and ask several important 
questions about which bands should be chosen.   Although the test-bed recommendations 
contained in the reports on the President’s Spectrum Policy Initiative called for approximately 20 
MHz  to be dedicated to the test-bed, with 10 MHz coming from NTIA and 10 MHz coming 
from the FCC pursuant to their respective jurisdictions, SSC believes that each agency should 
consider their respective government/non-government spectrum “contribution” as a minimum 
objective without feeling constrained to provide access to additional spectral resources under the 
test-bed program .  Therefore, at least 20 MHz should be identified for the test-bed and the bands 
chosen should be based on criteria that facilitate further development of dynamic sharing and CR 
technologies for broadband, military/homeland security and public safety applications.  
Experimenters seeking to demonstrate these technologies and applications in other bands should 
not be precluded from doing so just because such bands are not initially identified.  Thus, the 
primary purpose of the FCC and NTIA designating certain frequencies for the test-bed should be 
to facilitate more expeditious, or streamlined, processing and coordination as discussed below.9
                                                 
9 See Section III.A., infra. 
 
 
- 6 - 
In order to achieve the principal spectrum sharing objectives of the test-bed program, any 
criteria considered in pre-designating particular bands must be flexible to promote development 
of frequency agile equipment, yet it must also be targeted toward meeting other policy objectives 
and avoiding harmful interference.  Such bands need not necessarily be contiguous, but must 
have sufficient bandwidth (i.e., 2.5 MHz) to support broadband applications such as video.  
Eligible test-bed frequencies should be located in bands with good propagation characteristics 
(i.e., below 1 GHz), wide geographic coverage and low or iterant occupancy.  As to this last 
factor, SSC has collected a vast amount of spectrum occupancy data that shows which bands 
below 1 GHz are the least utilized.10  Appendix A, Table 1 provides an aggregate listing of 
spectrum occupancy measurements that SSC has made at several locations. 
C. Significant Steps Must be Taken to Avoiding Harmful Interference to Incumbent 
Users 
  
An obvious and legitimate substantive concern of NTIA and FCC (as well as incumbents 
operating in potential test-bed frequencies) is the methods by which users of the test-bed will 
avoid causing harmful interference to other authorized operations.  For example, the NTIA 
Notice of Inquiry asks whether an initial electromagnetic compatibility analysis (e.g., computer 
simulations) should be performed to develop the operating conditions for the test-bed (e.g., limits 
on radiated power levels, restrictions on antenna, geographic limitations).  The FCC Public 
Notice suggests that experiments could be limited to rural areas or areas where there are 
relatively few incumbent users to reduce the risk of causing harmful interference to an incumbent 
user.  In response to these concerns and suggestions, SSC proposes that clear and detailed 
                                                 
10 See http://www.sharedspectrum.com/?section=measurements; see also Mark McHenry and E. Daniel McCloskey, 
Multi-Band, Multi-Location Spectrum Occupancy Measurements in Proceedings of the NTIA International 
Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies at 167 (March 2006). 
 
- 7 - 
requirements be established to ensure that proposed spectrum sharing technologies can protect 
incumbents from harmful interference. 
In Appendix B, SSC lists numerous system design guidelines that should be employed by 
the test-bed system to reduce interference.  Some of these are conservative initial restrictions that 
can be lifted once successful interference-free operational experience is obtained.  SSC also 
provides a list of field test procedures that should be employed by test-bed participants.  While 
SSC agrees that incumbent operations should be completely protected, they should not be 
avoided with overly conservative geographic separations or restrictions.  Therefore, SSC also 
believes that it is important for this spectrum sharing test-bed program to produce useful and 
timely information for regulators (and incumbents) that shows, in the test-bed bands with co-
channel incumbent users, how: 
• 
Dynamic spectrum access techniques can be investigated and proven; 
• 
Remote modifications of the spectrum access algorithms and parameters can be made to 
adjust in-field, real-time operations in the presence of incumbent users; 
• 
Secondary, spectrum pooling schemes can be implemented in a real-world setting; and  
• 
Automated interference resolution capabilities work. 
    
Based on SSC’s experience in developing and conducting tests of spectrum sharing radios, to 
operate in bands with incumbent users a critical requirement is to use a variety of mechanisms to 
avoid harmful interference to these incumbent users.   Some of these mechanisms are described 
below and in Appendix C. 
A key test-bed requirement should be the ability to remotely reconfigure spectrum access 
algorithms of radios operating in these bands.  This is the only practical way to both avoid 
interference to incumbent users and to ultimately obtain regulatory approval of spectrum sharing 
technologies in a reasonable time and with the ability to operate at power levels for useful 
applications.  As evidenced by the prolonged, multi-year long DFS (Dynamic Frequency 
 
- 8 - 
Selection) rulemaking and testing procedure, it is very difficult to develop static spectrum access 
and sharing rules because of the complex nature of interference problems.  During the DFS 
process, a wide range of spectrum access measurement rates, threshold values, measurement 
frequencies (co-channel, adjacent channel, backup channel, etc.), mathematical operations on the 
data, time periods, and others were seriously considered.  Many involved more than parameters 
changes. 
In order to develop alternatives to this type of approach, NTIA and FCC should require 
that the test-bed spectrum access algorithms be remotely reconfigurable in both algorithm design 
and algorithm parameters.  This will allow the exploration of many spectrum access methods and 
improved performance because the “worse case” methods and parameters do not have to be 
established and fixed into regulations.  It will also provide network operators the ability to tailor 
the algorithms and parameters to the actual situation in the field and will give regulators the 
ability to adjust any feature without recalling equipment or imposing redeployment costs.  For an 
appropriately large-scale spectrum sharing test-bed, it will be simply impractical to use 
traditional fixed spectrum access methods where there is only the ability to change algorithm 
parameters because of the complexity of the interference problem and the wide range of 
incumbent conditions and test-bed user configurations that will be encountered.  Using remotely 
configurable spectrum access algorithms and parameters, test-bed radios can be iteratively 
adjusted in the field to arrive at both practical and “interference free” operating modes.  
Deploying the test-bed with fixed or only parameter adjustable spectrum access will cause 
endless delay with negotiations on the specific spectrum sharing algorithms to be employed or 
extreme operational limitations.

III. Procedural Elements of the Test-Bed Program 
A. The Test-Bed Should Rely on FCC’s Experimental Licensing System with 
Streamlined Processing and Coordination 
 
In response to the questions in the Notices regarding the use of the Commission’s 
experimental licensing program, SSC fully supports the general use of the existing experimental 
licensing rules in Part 5 of the Commission’s Rules, 47 CFR Part 5, as well as NTIA’s 
experimental authority under sections 7.11 and 8.2.27 of the NTIA Manual of Regulations and 
Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management.  The FCC’s flexible rules permit 
experimental operations on a non-interference basis in any government or non-government 
frequency designated in the Table of Frequency Allocations, “provided that the need for the 
frequency requested is fully justified by the applicant.” 47 CFR § 5.85(a), (c).  Although a 
rulemaking is not necessary to implement the test-bed program, application and coordination 
procedures should be streamlined to encourage participation and facilitate rapid access to 
designated test-bed frequencies. 
In 2002, the Commission’s Spectrum Policy Task Force addressed the Commission’s 
experimental licensing process and made a few modest recommendations regarding NTIA 
coordination, information sharing and expedited processing.11   To facilitate experimentation, the 
Task Force recommended that the Commission and NTIA work together to “identify – or pre-
clear – some location, frequency, and time combinations [in certain Federal government bands] 
where non-federal government spectrum users would be permitted to conduct experiments.”12

(E&UWG Report), available at http://www.fcc.gov/sptf/files/E&UWGFinalReport.pdf.  
  
12 SPTF Report at 61.  The Task Force also suggested that more direct communications between parties who have 
applied for experimental licenses and the federal government entities concerned about their pending experimental 
applications be permitted on a more regular basis.  It also recommended that the FCC and NTIA consider 
 
- 10 - 
SSC agrees with the Task Force that, in the context of the spectrum sharing test-bed, pre-
coordination of frequency and location pairs would reduce the risk and delays associated with 
applying for an experimental license and will stimulate radio technology experimentation in 
entrepreneurial firms.13  
To further encourage participation in the test-bed, the experimental licensing and 
coordination process for access to pre-cleared test-bed frequencies/areas should be streamlined 
through a two-phase electronic filing improvement program.   In the first phase immediately 
following the designation of available test-bed bands, areas and eligibility criteria, the 
Commission should immediately implement an auto-grant procedure for applications meeting 
basic technical and eligibility requirements for test-bed experimental licenses.  During this phase, 
applications would be deemed granted within 15 days of filing unless the Commission issues an 
affirmative “stop order” indicating why the test-bed application requires further review or 
coordination or does not otherwise meet the test-bed criteria.  The Commission would thus retain 
its control and the typical NTIA coordination timeframe would be preserved, but the party 
making the investment in the technology would be relieved of the inhibition that results from 
fears of delay in the event of non-action and lack of information.   This will also permit 
experimenting parties to prepare for tests and demonstrations in an efficient and cost-effective 
way by assuring prompt authorizations. 
In the second phase of the proposed streamlining approach, the Commission and NTIA 
could incorporate recently implemented automation technologies to provide even quicker 
                                                                                                                                                             
implementing a new interface for non-federal government spectrum users with IRAC members to help search for 
workable compromises for experimental license applications.  Another possible approach mentioned by the Task 
Force would be to consider appointing an advocate or ombudsman for the private sector.  Id.

processing and coordination.  For example, the agencies could implement an experimental 
licensing system that resembles the approach used for the Millimeter Wave 70-80-90 GHz Radio 
Service, which consists of a non-exclusive nationwide license, combined with a site-based 
registration process.14  Eligibility for a test-bed experimental license would first be established 
and then individual experiments in designated bands and areas could be registered without any 
delay (assuming all appropriate information and certifications are entered by the licensee). 
B. The Commission Should Provide Incentives Through Forbearing From Imposing 
Limits on Market Studies and the Opportunity for Long-Term Access 
 
 
To promote active participation, innovation and success by parties in the test-bed 
program, NTIA and the Commission should consider establishing limited incentives for bona 
fide entrepreneurs – and removing one potential disincentive.  Parties need adequate incentives to 
undertake costly large-scale field testing of new wireless technologies.  This is particularly true 
when the focus is on sophisticated interference avoidance techniques applicable to a wide 
assortment of spectral environments.  The use of marketplace incentives to encourage parties to 
undertake the investments and risks can be quite effective and is a preferable alternative to total 
governmental funding of the tests.  In other contexts there have been legitimate concerns that 
allowing experimental field testing to progress to full-scale commercial deployment might 
inhibit other future uses of the band.  Such concerns should not be a deterrent with respect to the 
frequency-agile, cognitive radio technology that is the focus of the test-bed since such equipment 
is easily reconfigurable and operable on a large number of available bands and is remotely 
controllable.   Nevertheless, the thoughts raised in the Notices concerning the possibility that a 
                                                 
14 See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Announces Permanent Process for Registering Links in the 71-76 GHz, 
81-86 GHz, and 92–95 GHz Bands, DA 05-311 (Feb. 3, 2005); NTIA New Release, NTIA and FCC Launch On-Line 
Registration For High-Speed Wireless Links Sharing Spectrum in the 70-80-90 GHz Bands (Feb. 8, 2005). 
 
 
- 12 - 
successful experiment would translate into permanent usage or a rulemaking proceeding to 
explore rule changes consistent with the experiment results could also provide a compelling 
incentive if such expectations were made clear at the outset.  While the key benefit of frequency-
agile cognitive radio technology is the absence of the need for a permanently fixed, primary 
allocation, allowing long-term secondary access to certain bands beyond the two-year 
experimental license period would lower expected transaction costs associated with gaining 
access to other encumbered bands. 
Whether or not there are any expectations of permanent or long-term access to the test-
bed or other frequency bands, it is important that the Commission remove the disincentive 
created by the prospect of FCC-imposed limitations on “market studies” utilizing experimental 
licenses.  Under section 5.3 of the Commission’s Rules, the Commission staff has the discretion 
to define the permissible scope of such market studies on a case-by-case basis.15  SSC proposes 
that the Commission affirmatively dispense with the three limitations potentially applicable to 
market tests in Part 5 authorizations.  Specifically, to facilitate early deployment of cognitive 
radio technology in the test-bed bands, as well as in other bands, and for purposes of real-world 
experimentation, it should state as a general policy for such authorizations that the restrictions in 
section 5.3 will not be imposed unless and until the Commissions affirmatively directs the 
experimenter to cease using a specific experimental frequency or the authorization otherwise 
expires. 
Since the test-bed technology proposed herein will be capable of remotely instituted 
software changes in the frequencies actually used without hardware changes and by central 
direction of the Part 5 licensee, there is no need to worry about possible future claims of

Regulation, FCC 98-283 (released Oct. 27, 1998). 
 
- 13 - 
“squatter’s rights” by experimenters.  Moreover, strict application of limits on market tests will 
harm the ability to market cognitive radios that will also likely use non-test-bed bands.  Since 
such devices are frequency agile and are likely to be mobile, they will potentially be hopping in 
and out of several bands even during a single transmission; some of the bands may be test-bed 
bands, while others may be unlicensed bands or bands to which access was obtained through 
secondary market negotiations with primary licensees.   
Finally, imposing such limits will hinder the ability to rapidly deploy dynamic spectrum 
sharing devices and systems in times of emergency.  For example, if an unmanned aerial vehicle 
(UAV) equipped with an XG transceiver (which was sold and marketed by a test-bed licensee to 
a government agency) needs to be quickly deployed to assist in disaster assessment and relief 
efforts using non-government test-bed frequencies, the mere fact that the equipment is not 
“owned by” the test-bed licensee should not require additional licensing procedures (e.g., special 
temporary authority) or, in the absurd case, result in the inability to access test-bed spectrum on 
an non-interference basis.  
C. NTIA Should Utilize and Streamline Cooperative Research and Development 
Agreements and Promote Other Funding Programs 
 
In addition to, or as an alternative to, an experimental licensing approach, NTIA and 
other governmental agencies could enter into Cooperative Research and Development 
Agreements (CRADAs) that include the same terms outlined above and in the appendices for 
experimental licenses to ensure against harmful interference to incumbent users.  This way, 
government spectrum users can take advantage of new and novel spectrum sharing technologies 
as they are being developed.  Most importantly, since engaging in useful broad-scale test-bed 
experiments is likely to be a costly endeavor, government funding will be essential, especially 
 
- 14 - 
for small businesses like SSC.  Accordingly, SSC strongly advises the NTIA and FCC to 
establish or encourage the establishment of additional funding sources for spectrum sharing 
innovation test-bed research and development through new and existing programs including: 
• 
XG and other DARPA programs;16 
• 
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer 
Research (STTR) programs;17 and 
• 
National Science Foundation (NSF) programs, including the Networking Technology 
Systems (NeTS), Programmable Wireless Networks (ProWiN) and Global Environment for 
Networking Innovations (GENI) programs.18 
 
For purposes of funding test-bed activities, SSC would be pleased to enter into a CRADA with 
NTIA’s Institute for Telecommunications Sciences (ITS) or other Federal Laboratories. 
 
IV. Conclusion 
 
As the leading developer of dynamic spectrum sharing technologies for cognitive radios, 
Shared Spectrum Company encourages the rapid implementation of the Spectrum Sharing 
Innovative Test-Bed.  SSC is currently finding solutions to difficult problems so that previously 
untapped spectrum capacity can be used more efficiently and effectively for a multitude of 
applications and platforms.  However, efficient access to adequate spectrum resources without 
substantial transaction costs will be the key to the early successful development of advanced 
spectrum sharing technologies.  This test-bed presents a unique opportunity for the Commission 
and NTIA to truly facilitate innovation and spectrum sharing.

Thus, rather than squandering this opportunity for major progress on small niche services 
dependent on the quirks of a single band, the goal of the overall test-bed program should be to 
develop broadly applicable technology that can be rolled out in numerous bands to meet the 
growing and shifting needs that are likely to characterize the future of telecommunications.  SSC 
looks forward to working with both agencies to demonstrate the benefits to all users of the 
spectrum by greatly increasing effective communications capacity.

Appendix B – Test-Bed System Design Features Used to Minimize Interference 
The Test-Bed should use the following system design features. 
Omni-Directional Antennas 
In the initial demonstrations, the Test-Bed nodes will use donut shaped gain, “omni-directional” 
discone type antennas.  The transmitted effective radiated power is low. 
 
As experience is gained and no interference reports received, the test-bed will be allowed to use 
directional antennas. 
Low Antenna Heights 
In the initial demonstrations, the Test-Bed will use an antenna height of two-meters or less and 
fixed antennas. 
 
As experience is gained and no interference reports received, the Test-Bed will be allowed to use 
up to 30 meter antennas in fixed applications and 2 meter high mobile antennas. 
Low Power Density Waveform 
The Test-Bed signal instantaneous bandwidth should be at least 1.5 MHz.  This will provide an 
18 dB reduction in spectral density compared to the popular 25 kHz bandwidth signals.   
 
In the initial demonstrations, the maximum Test-Bed signal transmit power should be 1 Watt 
average power.  This limits the potential interference distance in non-line of sight conditions to a 
few km. 
 
As experience is gained and no interference reports received, the Test-Bed will be allowed to use 
up to 10 W of average power. 
Spurious Signals 
The Test-Bed equipment should be tested for spurious signal output due to switch noise, switch 
control signal bleed through, harmonics, and other RF impairments.  The Spectrum mask should 
meet the IEEE-802.16 or similar specification.  An example would be to require that the power 
spectral density in a 100 kHz bandwidth to be down 25 dB when 4.75 MHz from the center 
frequency and 50 dB when 14.75 MHz.  This assumes a 10 MHz wide Test-Bed signal.  These 
frequency offset values would scale linearly for smaller bandwidth Test-Bed signals.   
 
The spurious signal testing should be performed by the Test-Bed group and submitted to the 
FCC and NTIA as part of the application. 
Frequency Lockout 
Initially, only the frequencies authorized in the Test-Bed experimental license will be used by the 
Test-Bed system.  A list of blocked out channels will be checked by the Test-Bed software in 
each node continually.   If the Test-Bed software attempts to transmit on a blocked channel, the 
action will be blocked and the event recorded. 
 
As experience is gained and no significant  interference reports received, the Test-Bed will be 
allowed to gain access to other government and non-government bands pursuant to additional 
 
experimental licenses, other assignments, through secondary market transactions or other 
authorized means. 
 
Inherent Test-Bed Interference Avoidance Functionality 
The Test-Bed system will use dynamic spectrum sharing technology to detect non-cooperative 
“victim” transceivers within the Test-Bed radio’s interference distance.  When this condition 
occurs, the Test-Bed transceiver selects another channel.  Information about observed frequency 
use will be stored for a time period to be determined and considered with respect to subsequent 
possible use of the channel.  Thus, recurring non-cooperative channel use will be a factor to 
considering the channel for use – not just whether use is detected at present.  In particular, for 
both simplex and duplex frequencies the equipment will estimate the usage of transmitters that 
can not be directly observed based on the frequency observations that are detectable. 
 
For example, the Test-Bed system may use channel detectors that are much more sensitive than 
normal receivers in making observations about whether a channel is in use.  This is possible due 
to knowledge of the modulation which is being looked for and the fact that the detector does not 
need to have an adequate signal-to-noise ratio to demodulate the signal with usable fidelity, 
rather it only needs enough signal-to-noise ratio to detect the present of the assumed modulation.  
The detection versus reception advantage depends on the non-cooperative signal emission type 
and varies from 5 dB for FM modulation to 20 dB for BPSK. 
 
 
Appendix C -- Precautions to be Used to Minimize Interference During the Field 
Demonstrations 
 
During the initial Test-Bed field demonstrations, the following procedures will be used to 
minimize interference to other spectrum users.  Each of these precautions greatly reduces the 
probability of interference to non-cooperative “victim” receivers.  All of the precautions together 
make the probability of interference very low. 
 
As experience is gained and no significant interference reports received, the Test-Bed will be 
afforded more flexibility. 
 
Continuous Spectrum Monitoring and Logging 
Before each demonstration, the spectrum authorized by the FCC will be monitored at a 
“command and control center” using a spectrum analyzer, a pre-amplifier and an elevated, 
dedicated antenna.  The monitoring will be done for a 30 minute period before the 
demonstrations and during the operation.   
 
An initial check of incumbent spectrum occupancy should be made.  All channels with received 
signal levels above –154 dBm/Hz (-174 dBm/Hz + 20 dB NF + 25 kHz BW) will be excluded 
from use by the Test-Bed equipment.   Both co-channel and adjacent channel signals will be 
monitored. 
 
During each demonstration, the spectrum will be monitored to check from proper Test-Bed 
operation.  If a Test-Bed node has a fault and transmits on a non-approved frequency, the 
operator at the command and control center will stop the demonstration.  
 
Command and Control 
Centralized Control of All Test-Bed Transmitters.   
All Test-Bed transceivers will be networked to a command and control system via a back-haul 
system consisting of fixed or mobile data links, commercial satellite internet stations or some 
other backhaul method.  The command and control system can stop all transmissions by of any 
Test-Bed node within 10 seconds.  If the Test-Bed node to command and control center 
connection is lost for more that 5 minutes, the Test-Bed node will limit transmissions to a 
reduced list of frequencies that are “assigned” as emergency backup with temporary primary 
status.   
 
The Test-Bed group shall provide points of contact that are available to immediately cease 
transmission if interference occurs. 
Continuous Connection to the Outside World via the Internet and/or Other Means 
The command and control station should have continuous connection to the outside world (i.e., 
to the local spectrum manager) via the Internet and/or telephone.  If an interference complaint is 
received from the outside world, the Test-Bed system will be immediately turned off to minimize 
any problems and to diagnose if the Test-Bed system is the cause.   
 
 
Test-Bed group should maintain a secure web site with both up to date test schedule information 
and contact information and will provide access information to FCC and other entities designated 
by FCC.   
 
The Test-Bed group should agree to work with NTIA and FCC once a location is decided to 
determine what a reasonable notification of “neighbors” is. 
Accountability 
The Test-Bed nodes should log the time, location, frequency and transmit power levels 
continuously.  These logs should be used for analysis of the Test-Bed algorithms and to analyze 
any interference events that might occur. 
Brief Transmission Periods 
The initial Test-Bed demonstrations will involve short transmission periods (several minutes or 
less).  All of the equipment (Test-Bed nodes, non-cooperative “victim” receivers and test 
transmitters) are centrally controlled via computer.  They will be switched off between 
experiments. 
 
As experience is gained and no interference reports received, the Test-Bed will be allowed to use 
continuous transmissions. 
Demonstration Location 
The demonstration areas should be selected to be at least 1 km away from other co-channel non-
cooperative transmitters without prior coordination with the potentially affected party.  The 
transmitter locations of all known incumbent users should be made available to the Test-Bed user 
by the FCC/NTIA.  
Personnel Experience 
All field testing should be overseen by an experienced engineer with significant RF expertise.  
This person should be qualified to operate spectrum analyzers and other test equipment to be 
able to determine if incumbent signals are present, and to determine the actual Test-Bed 
frequency, bandwidth and power levels.
