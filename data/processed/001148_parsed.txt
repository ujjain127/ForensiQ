WALSH, J. /s/ Peter J. Walsh
Before the Court is the motion (Doc. # 5) of Avanti
Corporate Health Systems, Inc. ("Avanti") to dismiss the three
count complaint of Joseph A. Pardo, Trustee of the FPA Creditor
Trust ("Trustee") to avoid and recover fraudulent and preferential
transfers.  This dispute arises from the prepetition sale by Avanti
to APF Co. f/k/a FPA Medical Management, Inc. ("FPA") of a
physician practice management company and the medical practices it
serviced.  The Trustee seeks to avoid and recover, inter alia, the
$4 million in cash and the 1,402,123 shares of its stock FPA paid
for the acquisition.  Avanti moves to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12
and 9(b).1  For the reasons discussed below I will deny the motion
as to count I and grant the motion as to counts II and III of the
complaint.
BACKGROUND
FPA purchased Avanti Health Systems of Texas, Inc.
("Avanti-Texas") from Avanti.  On November 19, 1997, FPA and Avanti
executed a Stock Purchase Agreement by which FPA acquired all the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Avanti-Texas.  In exchange,
FPA (i) paid Avanti $4 million in cash, (ii) transferred 1,402,123
shares of its publicly traded stock to Avanti, then valued at
3

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to "§___" herein
are to a section of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et
seq.
approximately $27 million, (iii) assumed certain liabilities of two
related entities, Doctors Officenter Medical Group of Houston, PA
("DOMGH") and Doctors Officenter Medical Group of Dallas, PA
("DOMGD"), and (iv) made certain additional payments to two
individual doctors, Charles E. Smith ("Smith") and William Merlin
("Merlin").  Less than a year later, on July 19, 1998, FPA filed
for voluntary chapter 11 relief.
Plaintiff is the Trustee of the FPA Creditor Trust
established by the confirmed chapter 11 plan in this case.  He is
seeking recovery of the assets, or their value, which FPA paid for
the acquisition of Avanti-Texas, DOMGH and DOMGD.  Counts I and II
seek to avoid and recover the assets as fraudulent transfers under
§§ 548, 544 and 550.2  Count III seeks to avoid and recover the
assets as preferences under §§ 547 and 550.
Avanti moves to dismiss on four grounds.  First, it
argues dismissal is warranted as a matter of law because there was
no "transfer of an interest of the debtor in property" as required
by § 547, § 548 and at relevant state law under § 544 because a
corporation has no ownership interest in shares of its own stock.
Second, Avanti argues count II of the complaint fails to plead

The failure to plead a claim with the particularity required
by Rule 9(b) is a failure to state a claim upon which relief
may be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). 
intentional fraud with particularity as mandated by Rule 9(b).3
Avanti also moves to dismiss count II under § 544 because it does
not identify an actual unsecured creditor under whose rights the
Trustee is claiming nor does it identify the applicable state law
pursuant to which he is proceeding.  Finally, Avanti moves to
dismiss count III because it fails to adequately plead a preference
under § 547.  I will address each argument in turn.
DISCUSSION
A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) serves to test the
sufficiency of the complaint.  Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 183
(3d Cir. 1993); Loftus v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth.,
843 F.Supp. 981, 984 (E.D. Pa. 1994).  When deciding such a motion,
I accept as true all allegations in the complaint and all
reasonable inferences drawn from it which I consider in a light
most favorable to the plaintiffs.  Morse v. Lower Merion School
Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997); Rocks v. City of
Philadelphia, 868 F.2d 644, 645 (3d Cir. 1989).  I should not grant
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion "unless it appears beyond doubt that
[plaintiff] can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim
which would entitle [it] to relief."  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S.
5
41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102 (1957).
Avanti moves to dismiss counts I and II as a matter of
law because they fail to plead "a transfer of an interest of the
debtor in property" as required by § 548 or at state law under §
544.  Avanti argues that it is well-settled that a corporation has
no property interest in shares of its own stock and that
consequently, a transfer of the debtor's own stock cannot be the
basis of a fraudulent transfer.  In response, the Trustee argues
that although a corporation may not have an ownership interest in
capital stock, it does have an ownership interest in treasury
stock.  The Trustee also argues that dismissal based on the status
of the FPA stock alone is inappropriate because the complaint is
not limited to the FPA stock as the property fraudulently
transferred.  I agree with the Trustee for two reasons.
First, without regard to the FPA stock, counts I and II
state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.   For
purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, I take all "well pleaded
allegations of the complaint as true, construe the complaint in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under
any circumstances, the plaintiff might be entitled to any relief."
Helstoski v. Goldstein, 552 F.2d 564, 565 (3d Cir. 1977). 
The Trustee challenges the entire transaction between FPA
and Avanti as fraudulent.  Accordingly, the complaint attacks not
only the transferred stock, but also FPA's assumption of assorted
6
liabilities, its transfer of cash and the "additional payments" FPA
made to Merlin and Smith.  Complaint at ¶¶ 19 - 32.  Thus, even if
one ignores the value of the FPA stock, and construing the
allegations in a light most favorable to the Trustee, the complaint
adequately alleges "a transfer of an interest in property of the
debtor" for purposes of pleading a fraudulent conveyance.
Second, whether the FPA stock may be the basis of a
fraudulent transfer action may turn on whether it is treasury stock
or authorized and reissued stock.  Avanti cites authority for the
proposition that a corporate debtor does not have a property
interest in shares of its capital stock the transfer of which would
render it subject to a fraudulent conveyance action.  E.g.,Uranga
v. Geib (In re Paso del Norte Oil Co.), 755 F.2d 421, 424 (5th Cir.
1985); Hansen v. Finn (In re Curry and Sorensen, Inc.), 57 B.R.
824, 829 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1986).  There is case law, however, that
suggests a corporation does own treasury stock such that its
transfer would bring it within the scope of § 548 or relevant state
law under § 544.  See, e.g., Webster v. Barbara (In re Otis &
Edwards, 
P.C.), 
115 
B.R. 
900, 
909 
(Bankr. 
E.D. 
Mich.
1990)(principles of corporate finance theory regarding accounting
of treasury shares as noncorporate assets "are of limited use in
the fraudulent conveyance context"); Karasik v. Pac. Eastern Corp.,
180 A. 604, 606 (Del. Ch. 1935)("[S]tock when acquired [by the
corporation] becomes treasury stock which may be sold by the
7
corporation and realized upon as any other asset; or, if it is
desired not to sell the stock, its retention by the corporation
increases pro tanto the asset value underneath the stock held by
the general body of the stockholders who are in a material though
not technical sense the corporation . . .");  Martin J.
Bienenstock, Once in Bankruptcy, Whose Company is it Anyway?  573
PLI/Comm. 667, 675 n.10 (1991) ("[t]reasury stock owned by the
debtor is property of the estate and may be recovered if
fraudulently transferred").
The parties dispute whether FPA gave  treasury or capital
stock to Avanti.  See Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Opposition
to . . . Dismiss Complaint (Doc. # 14) at p. 5 n.2 ("On information
and belief, the stock transferred to Avanti by FPA was treasury
stock of the Debtors") and p. 12 ("Moreover, it is unclear whether
the FPA Stock . . . was unissued stock or treasury stock”) and
Reply Memorandum of . . . Avanti (Doc. # 17) at p. 10 n.2 ("Section
4.02(a) of the Stock Purchase Agreement provides that with
reference to the FPA Common Stock, 'no shares were held in the
treasury of FPA'").  It is not appropriate to adjudicate such a
dispute of fact in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  If
Avanti is right that the FPA stock is not treasury stock, it may be
possible to resolve the matter in a subsequent motion for partial
summary judgment.  At this time, however, the Trustee states at
least a colorable claim for relief so that dismissal of counts I
8
and II on this issue under Rule 12(b)(6) as a matter of law is not
proper.
Avanti next moves to dismiss those portions of counts I
and II which allege intentional fraud because they fail to comply
with the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b).  Avanti argues
dismissal is warranted because the complaint "omits mention of any
facts and circumstances constituting or suggesting intentional
fraud, much less identification of each defendant's contribution to
the alleged fraud."  Memorandum of Law of . . . Avanti . . . in
Support of Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 6) at p. 10 (emphasis in
original). 
Rule 9(b) requires that "[i]n all averments of fraud . .
. the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall be stated with
particularity."  Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).  The Third Circuit condones a
lenient approach to application of this standard. Seville Indus.
Machin. Corp. v. Southmost Machin. Corp., 742 F.2d 786, 791 (3d
Cir. 1984).  Although a plaintiff must plead with particularity the
circumstances of the alleged fraud, a plaintiff need not plead the
"date, place or time" of the fraud so long as they use an
"alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of
substantiation into their allegations of fraud."  Id.  Especially
in bankruptcy cases, where the plaintiff is a trustee acting on
behalf of the estate or a group of creditors, courts apply Rule
9(b) with greater flexibility recognizing that trustees often lack
9
knowledge or have only secondhand knowledge of prepetition
fraudulent acts involving the debtor and third parties.  E.g.,
Flexi-van Leasing, Inc. v. Perez (In re Perez), 155 B.R. 844, 849
(Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1993)(when applying Rule 9(b) "bankruptcy courts
do not necessarily require the rigid standards demanded in a non-
bankruptcy civil proceeding"); Davidson v. Twin City Bank (In re
Hollis & Co.), 83 B.R. 588, 590 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1988)
(recognizing more liberal approach to fraud pleading in bankruptcy
cases where trustee brings suit); Birnberg v. Rancho la Costa, Inc.
(In re Reach McClinton & Co.), 62 B.R. 978, 981 (Bankr. D.N.J.
1986)(discussing Rule 9(b) and noting trustees work at a
disadvantage and under greater disability).
I find that the Trustee's complaint meets the Rule 9(b)
pleading requirements.  The complaint alleges the circumstances
surrounding the alleged fraud as follows: 
In November 1997, FPA acquired Avanti-Texas and related
entities from Avanti, Smith and Merlin.  Complaint at ¶
19.
FPA executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with Avanti
pursuant to which FPA acquired all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Avanti-Texas.  Complaint at
¶ 20.
As consideration for the acquisition of Avanti-Texas, FPA
paid Avanti, Smith and Merlin $4 million in cash;
1,402,123 shares of FPA Stock with an approximate fair
market value of $27 million; and certain additional
payments to Smith and Merlin.  FPA also assumed certain
liabilities. Complaint at ¶¶ 21 -25.
In connection with the purchase, Smith sold his 100%
stock interest in DOMGH to Kevin Ellis, an officer of
10
FPA, for additional payments from FPA.  Complaint at ¶
24.
FPA made the transfers with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud entities to which FPA became indebted on
or after the date of the transfers and FPA was insolvent
or became insolvent as a result of the transfer at the
time they were made.  Complaint at ¶¶ 27-28.
This provides sufficient notice to Avanti of who committed the
alleged fraud and its surrounding circumstances to satisfy Rule
9(b).
Avanti also moves to dismiss count II under § 544(b)
because it fails to identify an unsecured creditor under whose
rights the Trustee is claiming.  Section 544(b) permits the Trustee
to exercise whatever rights of avoidance a creditor holding an
unsecured allowable claim could have exercised on its own behalf
under applicable state or federal non-bankruptcy law.  11 U.S.C. §
544(b). Avanti contends the Trustee must specifically plead the
existence of an identified creditor who held a claim at the time of
the transfer and the state law pursuant to which he is proceeding.
I am not persuaded that a trustee must do so, but I agree with
Avanti that in this case, the Trustee's complaint is deficient.
When analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint for
purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), courts do not generally require a
trustee to plead the existence of an unsecured creditor by name,
although the trustee must ultimately prove such a creditor exists.
Fisher v. MRM Group, Inc. (In re Multi-Risk Mgmt., Inc.), 1998 WL
11
566044, at *2 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1998) (trustee must not plead by
name existence of creditors under § 544(b)) citing Matter of
Leonard, 125 F.3d 543, 544 (7th Cir. 1997); Askanase v. Fatjo, 1993
WL 208682, at * 4 (S.D. Tex. 1993)("Although the trustee at trial
must establish the existence of an allowed claim that could have
been avoided, the complaint need not outline all the elements of a
§ 544(b) claim").  A complaint, however, "must set forth sufficient
information to outline the elements of [the] claim or to permit
inferences to be drawn that these elements exist."  Walker v. South
Cent. Bell Tel. Co., 904 F.2d 275, 277 (5th Cir. 1990).
Count II does not meet this standard.  Without more, the
Trustee simply incorporates the previous allegations of the
complaint (at ¶ 33) and adds the conclusory assertion that "[t]he
Debtors' transfers of property as a result of the Transaction
constitute fraudulent transfers under applicable nonbankruptcy law,
which are avoidable and recoverable by the Trustee pursuant to 11
U.S.C. § 544 and applicable state law."  Complaint at ¶ 34.  He
provides no other information.  This portion of the pleading is so
vague that drawing inferences regarding the elements of § 544(b) is
difficult.  Although liberal, the pleading requirements of the
Federal Rules are not intended to reduce a defendant to guesswork
and conjecture.  Avanti's motion to dismiss count II is therefore
granted.  I do so without prejudice to the Trustee’s right to amend
the complaint and I find that relation back under the circumstances
12
4
Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 permits a party to amend his pleading by leave
of the court, and "leave shall be freely given when justice so
requires." Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  An amendment “relates back to
the date of the original pleading when the claim . . .
asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,
transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set
forth in the original pleading.”   Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).  Courts
"almost always" dismiss complaints under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, 9(b)
and 12(b)(6) with leave to amend.  Glinka v. Dartmouth Banking
Co. (In re Kelton Motors, Inc.), 121 B.R. 166, 189 (Bankr.
D.Vt. 1990) citing Luce v. Edelstein, 802 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir.
1986).
would be proper.4
Finally, Avanti argues that count III for avoidance of a
preferential transfer under § 547(b) should be dismissed because it
does not adequately plead the necessary elements, specifically, the
complaint fails to identify the allegedly preferential transfers.
I agree.
Under section § 547, the Trustee must establish that:
(1)  an interest of the debtor was transferred;
(2) the transfer was made to or for the benefit of 
Avanti;
(3)
the transfer was because of an antecedent debt;
(4)
the debtor was insolvent at the time of the 
transfer;
(5)
the transfer occurred within ninety days before the
bankruptcy petition was filed; and
(6) the transfer permitted Avanti to receive more than
it would have received upon liquidation of the
debtor under the Code.
11 U.S.C. § 547(b); Glenshaw Glass Co. v. Ontario Grape
Growers Mktg. Bd. (In re Keystone Foods, Inc.), 145 B.R.
502, 508 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1992).
Count III recites the statutory language of § 547(b) and
then simply concludes that "[d]uring the ninety (90) days preceding
13
the Filing Date, the Debtors made a number of payments to
Defendants, some or all of which were as a result of the
Transaction (the "Preference Payments")."  Complaint at ¶¶ 36 -37.
The Trustee fails to provide even rudimentary facts surrounding the
preferences -- e.g., the date, time and amount of the allegedly
preferential payments, to whom made, the respective values, etc. --
a point which the Trustee essentially concedes.
Although the Federal Rules require only a "short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled
to relief," Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), a plaintiff must do more than merely
recite the statutory language to survive a motion to dismiss.
Accord e.g., State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Jenkin (In re Jenkin),
83 B.R. 733, 735 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1988)("A complaint that contains
a mere recitation of the statutory language, does not state a cause
of action...").  I will therefore grant Avanti's motion to dismiss
count III and as before, I do so without prejudice to the Trustee
to file an amended complaint that can relate back under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, I will deny in part and
grant in part Avanti's motion to dismiss the Trustee's complaint.
I deny the motion to dismiss count I of the complaint.  I find that
the Trustee pleads a colorable claim for relief to avoid and
recover the assets FPA transferred to Avanti in consideration for
14
FPA's acquisition of Avanti-Texas, DOMGH and DOMGD under § 548 and
§ 544.  However, I will grant Avanti's motion to dismiss counts II
and III of the complaint. I do so without prejudice to the
Trustee's right to file an amended complaint that can relate back
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).
