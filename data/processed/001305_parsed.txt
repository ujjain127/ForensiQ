Evapotranspiration 
of Corn and 
Forage Sorghum  
for Silage 
The  U.S. Southern High Plains is the center of 
large regional beef cattle and swine feeding industries 
with about 35% of all the U.S. feed beef cattle within a 
250 km radius from Amarillo, TX.  Recently, dairies 
have expanded within the region with two nearby large 
cheese processing plants.  The beef feedyards have util-
ized limited amounts of silages, primarily from corn in 
past years, but the dairies impose a much greater de-
mand for forages and silages.  Corn (Zea mays L.) has a 
large water use, yet it produces high grain yields and 
digestible nutrients.  Forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor 
(L.) Moench) can produce similar silage quality and 
uses less water, but forage sorghum also yields less bio-
mass than corn. 
Howell et al. (2006) presented a summary of crop coef-
ficient and evapotranspiration (ET) data from Bushland, 
TX for irrigated corn, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), 
sorghum, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), cotton 
(Gossypium hirsutum L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa 
L.).  Limited literature exists on ET of corn and forage 
sorghum grown for silage in the Southern High Plains.  
The purpose of this paper is to present a preliminary 
summary of water use and crop coefficient data for corn 
and forage sorghum produced for silage in the Southern 
High Plains having a semi-arid, advective environment 
for the 2006 and 2007 seasons.  Since the 2006 corn 
was replanted with a short-season hybrid, we’ll focus 
this report just on the 2007 season’s results.

These studies were conducted at the 
USDA-ARS Conservation and Pro-
duction Research Laboratory at Bushland, TX (35º 11' 
N lat.; 102º 06' W long.; 1,170 m elev. above MSL) in 
2006 and 2007.  Crop ET was measured with two 
weighing lysimeters (Marek et al., 1988) each located in 
the center of 4.4-ha 210 m E-W by 210 m N-S fields 
(two fields arranged in a rectangular  pattern).  The soil 
at this site is classified as Pullman clay loam (fine, 
mixed, superactive thermic Torrertic Paleustoll) (Unger 
and Pringle, 1981; Taylor et al., 1963) which is de-
scribed as slowly permeable because of a dense B22 
horizon about 0.3 to 0.5 m below the surface.  The plant 
available water holding capacity within the top 2.0 m of 
the profile is approximately 240 mm (Tolk and Howell, 
2001) ~200 mm to 1.5-m) depth).  A calcareous layer at 
about the 1.4-m depth limits significant rooting and wa-
ter extraction below this depth.  Variations of this soil 
series are common to more than 1.2 million ha of land 
in this region and about 1/3 of the sprinkler-irrigated 
area in the Texas High Plains (Musick et al., 1988).  
Weighing lysimeters offer one of the most accurate 
means to measure ET (Hatfield, 1990).  Predominate 
wind direction is SW to SSW, and the unobstructed 
fetch (fallow fields or dryland cropped areas) in this 
direction exceeds 1 km. The field slope is less than 0.3 
percent.  More descriptive information is provided in 
Howell et al. (1995b), Howell et al. (1997), Evett et al. 
(2000), and Howell et al. (2004).   
Lysimeter Procedures 
Lysimeter mass was determined using a Campbell Sci-
entific1 CR-7X data logger (Campbell Scientific, Inc., 
Logan, UT) to measure and record the lysimeter load 
cell (Interface SM-50, Scottsdale, AZ) signal at 0.5-Hz 
(2 s) frequency.  The load cell signal was averaged for 5 
min and composited to 30-min means (reported on the 
mid point of the 30 min interval, i.e. data were averaged 
from 0-30 minutes and reported at 15 min).  The 
lysimeter mass resolution was 0.01 mm, and its accu-
racy exceeded 0.05 mm (Howell et al., 1995a).  Daily 
ET was determined as the difference between lysimeter 
mass losses (from evaporation and transpiration) and 
lysimeter mass gains (from irrigation, precipitation, or 
dew) divided by the lysimeter area (9 m2).  A pump 
regulated to -10 kPa provided vacuum drainage, and the 
drainage effluent was held in two tanks suspended from 
the lysimeter (their mass was part of the total lysimeter 
mass) and independently weighed by load cells 
(drainage rate data are not reported here).  Lysimeter ET 
data included days with irrigations and rainfall.  
Weather Data 
Solar irradiance, wind speed, air temperature, dew point 
temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and baro-
metric pressure were measured at an adjacent weather 
station (Howell et al., 1995b) operated by the Texas 
High Plains ET Network (Porter et al., 2005) placed 
over an irrigated grass surface (cool-season lawn mix-
ture containing bluegrass, perennial rye-grass, etc.).   
Crop Coefficients 
Reference ET (ETos and ETrs) was computed with the 
ASCE/EWRI standardized equations (Allen et al., 
2005) using the Texas High Plains ET Network (Porter 
et al., 2005).  These calculations were verified using 
REF-ET© v2 (Allen, 2001).   Crop coefficients were 
computed as  
                            
  
 
 
where ETc is the crop water use expressed in mm d-1 
and 
represents a reference crop water use ex-
pressed in the same units (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; 
Jensen et al., 1990; Allen et al., 1998).  The symbols of 
ETo and Kco are used for clipped grass (0.12-m tall), and 
the symbols of ETr and Kcr were used for alfalfa (0.5-m 
tall) in this paper.  The Kc values are presented and dis-
cussed qualitatively, here, only on a time scale (day of 
year).  
Agronomic Procedures 
Corn (NC+7373RB, NC+ Hybrids, Lincoln, NB) was 
planted on 17 May in 2007 (DOY 137).  Forage sor-
ghum (Dairymaster, Richardson Seeds, Ltd., Vega, TX) 
was planted on 30 May in 2007 (DOY 150).  The forage 
sorghum hybrid was a “brown mid rib” variety that re-
portedly has a higher digestibility (Bean et al., 2007).  
The previous crop in 2005 was irrigated grain sorghum.  
In 2006, corn was grown on the NE lysimeter field, and 
the forage sorghum was grown on the SE lysimeter 
field.  In 2007, forage sorghum was grown on the NE 
lysimeter field, and corn was grown on the SE lysimeter 
field.  Cultural practices were typical for high yielding 
irrigated silage crops in this region.   
Irrigation 
The lysimeter fields were irrigated with a lateral-move 
sprinkler system to meet the crop water use.  The sprin-
kler system was a 10-span lateral-move system 
(Lindsay Manufacturing, Omaha, NB) with an end-feed 
hose and aboveground, end guidance cable.  The sprin-
kler system was aligned N-S, and irrigated E-W or W-E.

The system was equipped with gooseneck fittings and 
spray heads (Nelson Irrigation Corp., Walla Walla, WA) 
with concave spray plates on drops located about 1.5 m 
above the ground and 1.5 m apart.  Each spray head was 
equipped with a 100-kPa pressure regulator and a 1-kg 
polyethylene drop weight.  Irrigations were scheduled 
to meet the crop ET water use rate (by daily plotting the 
lysimeter masses in terms of water depth) and were 
typically applied in one to two 25-mm applications per 
week. 
Soil Water Measurements 
Soil water contents were measured periodically using a 
neutron probe (model 503DR Hydroprobe, CPN Inter-
national, Inc., Martinez, CA) at 0.2-m depth increments 
beginning with the 0.10-m depth using 30-s counts and 
methods described in Hignett and Evett (2002).  Two 
access tubes were located in each lysimeter (read to 1.9-
m depth), and four tubes were located in the field sur-
rounding each lysimeter (read to 2.3-m depth).  The 
probe was field calibrated for the Pullman soil using a 
method similar to that described by Evett and Steiner 
(1995). 
Plant and Yield Sampling 
In each field for the two crop species, plant samples 
from three separate 1.5-m2 areas were obtained periodi-
cally to measure crop development.  These field sam-
ples were taken at sites about 10 to 20 m away from the 
lysimeters in areas of the field representative of the 
lysimeter vegetation.  Leaf area index (LAI), crop 
height (CH), and aboveground dry matter (DM) were 
measured from three samples.  Final yield was meas-
ured by harvesting the lysimeter grain and aboveground 
plant matter from each lysimeter (9 m2), and dry matter 
and yield at harvest were measured from three adjacent 
1.5-m2 plant samples.  Forage quality samples were ob-
tained and sent to a testing laboratory for nutritive and 
digestibility analyses (results not presented here).  Field 
harvest was on 15 October in 2007 (DOY 288).

of the SE weighing lysimeter on 15 June 
2007 with silage corn.  The 2007 year re-
ceived 411 mm of rainfall (Fig. 2), which is 
below the long-term Bushland, TX annual 
precipitation of 480 mm.  The growing sea-
son rainfall was typical or exceeded the 
long-term growing season rainfall, however.  
Figure 2 illustrates the growing season rain-
fall and irrigation in 2007 along with the 
cumulative ETc from the two crops.  Table 1 
presents the crop water use, dry matter yield, 
and water productivity for each crop in 
2007.  Both crops are C4 species and should 
be expected to have similar water productiv-
ities.  The corn produced nearly identical 
water productivity (~3.6 kg m-3) to previous 
corn crops (see Howell et al., 1998 for crop 
water productivities for corn hybrids with 
differing maturity).  The forage sorghum had 
less ET and irrigation requirement in 2007 
but with comparable water productivity 
(~3.5 kg m-3) with corn (~3.6 kg m-3) al-
though the forage sorghum had less yield 
(~38%).  Figure 3 shows photographs of the 
fields (Fig. 3A) in 2007 and the forage sor-
ghum lysimeter (Fig. 3B).  Figure 4 shows a 
photograph of the forage sorghum silage 
harvest in 2006. 
Several reference ET equations were com-
pared with the ASCE-EWRI Standardized 
Penman-Monteith equation (ASCE PM 
ETso) for a short crop reference ET (ETso) 
(Allen et al., 2005) at Bushland, TX in Table 
2.  Of interest is the close agreement be-
tween the ETso (Allen et al., 2005) and the 
ASCE PM ETo, (Jensen et al., 1990), 1948 
Penman ETo (48 Pen ETo) and the 1996 
Kimberly Penman ETo (96 Kpen ETo) equa-
tions.  The tall crop reference ET (ETr) was 
consistently about 1.4 times ETso.  The two 
temperature-radiation reference ET equa-
tions [1985 Hargreaves (85 Harg ETo) and 
1972 Priestley-Taylor (72 P-T ETo)] consis-
tently underestimated ETso at Bushland, TX 
and had the lowest coefficients of determi-

nation (r2).  These relationships are 
important in translating crop coeffi-
cients (Kc) from location to location. 
Crop Development 
Both crops reached a maximum crop 
height of nearly 3 m in 2007 (Fig. 5).  
The forage sorghum had a maximum 
LAI of 5.4 while the corn LAI maxi-
mum was slightly greater than 7.  
The final harvest dry matter was 
1.70 kg m-2 for the forage sorghum 
and 2.44 kg m-2 for the corn. 
Soil Water 
The 2007 season had a larger initial 
soil water content than in 2006.  Fig-
ure 6 shows the mean and standard 
deviation of soil water content of the 
upper 1.5-m profile at four neutron 
tube sites nearby each weighing 
lysimeter in 2007.  Because the 
spray heads were not re-nozzled for 
the different crop fields, the irriga-
tion amounts applied to each crop 
during a growing season were ap-
proximately the same.  This slightly 
over- irrigated the forage sorghum 
while slightly deficit irrigating the 
corn.  The corn field and lysimeter, 
especially in 2007, had ample soil 
water in the soil profile to likely 
meet full crop needs.  But any deficit 
irrigation of corn may have slightly 
reduced the evaporation from the 
soil.  The mean soil water content for 
the forage sorghum illustrates this 
“recharge” of the profile (Fig. 6) un-
til the crop ET met or exceeded irri-
gation plus rainfall (Fig. 2).  The 
mean 1.5-m profile soil water con-
tent didn’t exceed the “field capac-
ity” of the Pullman soil, except once 
at one neutron tube site for the for-
age sorghum.  The corn utilized the 
available profile soil water when 
irrigation and rainfall were less than 
the crop ET.    
Crop Coefficients 
Crop coefficients for both species in 
Figures 7 and 8 for the short-crop 
reference ET (ETo) and the tall-crop 
reference ET (ETr), respectively, for 
the 2007 season.  Although with 
sprinkler irrigation it is difficult to 
achieve “basal” conditions (Wright, 
1982), we drew straight line seg-
ments like FAO-56 (Allen et al., 
1998) to estimate our approximation 
of the “basal” crop coefficients.  In 
2007, the forage sorghum initial 
“basal” Kc was estimated as 0.15 for 
ETo (Fig. 7) and 0.12 for ETr (Fig. 8) 
while the corn initial “basal” Kc was 
estimated as 0.20 for ETo (Fig. 7) 
and 0.17 for ETr (Fig. 8).  The maxi-
mum forage sorghum “basal” Kc was 
estimated as 0.90 for ETo (Fig. 7) 
and 0.70 for ETr (Fig. 8) in 2007 
while the corn maximum “basal” Kc 
was estimated as 1.1 for ETo (Fig. 7) 
and 0.85 for ETr (Fig. 8) in 2007.  
The initial “basal” Kc for sorghum at 
Davis, CA was 0.12 (Jensen et al., 
1990) for ETso.  Wright (1982) de-
termined the initial corn “basal” Kc 
at Kimberly, ID as 0.15 for ETsr.  
The maximum “basal” Kc at Davis, 
CA for grain sorghum was 1.08 for 
ETo (Jensen et al., 1990) and 0.93 for 
field corn for ETr at Kimberly, ID 
(Wright 1982).  The Bushland forage 
sorghum “basal” Kc was slightly 
lower than the reported for Davis, 
CA data for grain sorghum for the 
ETo reference ET (0.90 at Bushland 
in 2007 compared with 1.08 at

Davis, CA), but the California data were usually based 
on “real” mowed, irrigated grass reference ET.  The 
Idaho field corn Kc data were computed using the 1982 
Kpen reference ETr (Wright, 1982).  When the maxi-
mum field corn Kc at Kimberly, ID of 0.96 (Jensen et 
al., 1990) was converted using the 1982 Kpen mean ETr 
(Table 2) and the mean ASCE-EWRI ETsr (Table 2) 
[means for 1 March to 31 October], the adjusted Kim-
berly, ID corn maximum Kc is about 0.85 for ETr at 
Bushland, TX., which exactly matches the Bushland 
corn Kc value (0.85) for ETr.  The estimated Bushland 
“basal” Kc values generally agree with the “basal” Kc 
values from both Davis, CA and Kimberly, ID when the 
uncertainties in measuring ETc and in estimating refer-
ence   
are considered together with weather data 
uncertainties (Allen et al., 2005). 
Forage sorghum offers an attractive 
alternative to corn for silage in the 
Southern High Plains to conserve water while achieving 
nearly equal water productivity as corn.  However, the 
yield of forage sorghum will be less than corn for silage.  
In 2007, when a valid comparison between forage sor-
ghum and corn was feasible, the forage sorghum was 
about the same height as the corn with LAI being lower 
(~5.4 compared with ~7.1) and having less dry matter 
(~1,700 g m-2 compared with ~2,400 g m-2 for corn).  
However, the forage sorghum ET was significantly less 
(by ~180 mm in 2007 or ~27%).  The reduced irrigation 
demand of forage sorghum makes it more compatible 
with declining well yields as forage demands from dair-
ies increase on the Southern High Plains.  Forage sor-
ghum should be examined as an alternative to corn for 
silage in the regional water planning to meet future wa-
ter requirements with reduced water availability in the 
Southern High Plains from the Ogallala Aquifer. 
These data were obtained 
through the dedicated and 
meticulous work of numerous technicians in the USDA-
ARS Soil and Water Research Unit at Bushland, TX.  
Their tireless efforts were required to obtain these data, 
and we sincerely recognize their dedication.

Radiative transfer 
models for the soil-
plant-atmosphere continuum are the 
basic drivers for models that describe 
crop growth and development, 
evapotranspiration (ET), and gas ex-
change. Effective water resource man-
agement in irrigated regions, for exam-
ple, require accurate estimates of ET, 
which can be accomplished with two-
source energy balance models, where 
the energy balance of the soil and can-
opy layers are computed separately 
(Kustas and Norman, 1999; Kustas et 
al., 2004). Colaizzi et al. (2006) evalu-
ated a two-source energy balance 
model against ET measurements of 
various crops grown in large weighing 
lysimeters at the USDA-ARS Conser-
vation and Production Research Labo-
ratory at Bushland, TX. Overall model 
agreement with measured ET was ac-
ceptable; however, they observed sig-
nificant errors for some energy compo-
nents, such as net radiation partitioning 
between the soil and canopy layers for 
row crops with partial canopy cover. 
This pointed to the need to investigate 
and refine radiative transfer models 
designed for these conditions. 
Campbell and Norman (1998; 
hereafter referred to as CN98) de-
scribed a radiative transfer model for 
vegetation and soil that only required 
incident global radiation and basic 
knowledge of canopy characteristics. 
The CN98 model separates the visible 
and near-infrared portions of the short-
wave spectrum, and further separates 
these into their direct beam and diffuse 
components, all of which have very 
different transmittance and reflectance 
properties. We refined the CN98 model 
by including several new parameters 
that account for the “clumping” nature 
of row crops for any row orientation 
(e.g., circular rows typically found un-
der center-pivot irrigation systems). 
Briefly, these parameters were the frac-
tion of canopy cover normal to the so-
lar beam (fcs), the path length fraction 
(PLF) of a solar beam propagating 
through a canopy relative to nadir, and 
the multiple row function (MRF) to 
account for a solar beam propagating 
through more than one crop row at low 
zenith angles. These parameters were 
analogous to the “clumping factor” de-
scribed by Chen and Cihlar (1995), 
Anderson et al. (2005), and others. We 
evaluated the CN98 model with these 
refinements for grain corn, grain sor-
ghum, and upland cotton, which are 
important row crops for the Texas High 
Plains economy. 
The present study 
was conducted at the 
USDA-ARS Conservation and Produc-
tion Research Laboratory, Bushland, 
TX, USA (35º 11' N lat., 102º 06' W 
long., 1,170 m elevation M.S.L.). The 
climate is semi-arid with a high evapo-
rative demand of about 2,600 mm per 
year (Class A pan evaporation) and low 
precipitation averaging 470 mm per 
year. Strong advection of heat energy 
from the South and Southwest is typi-
cal. The soil was a Pullman clay loam 
(fine, mixed, super active, thermic tor-
rertic Paleustolls) with slow permeabil-
ity (Unger and Pringle, 1981).

radiation parameters are summarized 
in Table 1. All measurements were 
sampled every 6 s and reported as 0.5 
h averages (0.25 h in 2007). Only days 
with clear skies were used, which 
would be of primary interest for re-
mote sensing applications, and to re-
duce data sets to a manageable size. 
Incoming shortwave solar radiation 
(Rs), incoming photosynthetic active 
radiation (IPAR), transmitted short-
wave radiation (TRs), and transmitted 
PAR (TPAR) were measured for grain 
corn (Zea mays L.; 1989 and 2007 sea-
sons), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor 
L.; 1988 and 2007 seasons), and up-
land cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.; 
2000, 2001, and 2007 seasons) 
(Howell et al., 1997; 2004). Reflected 
shortwave (RRs), reflected PAR 
(RPAR), and total net radiation (Rn) 
were measured for corn (1989 only) 
and grain sorghum (RPAR measured 
in 1988 only). (Note that components 
commonly reported as PAR are actu-
ally the photosynthetic photon flux 
density in units of µmol m-2 s-1). In 
1992, measurements of RRs and 
RPAR were used over bare soil at two 
lysimeter sites to determine soil albedo 
and reflectance in the visible and near 
infrared spectrums. The RRs and 
RPAR measurements over bare soil 
used the same instrumentation as 1988 
grain sorghum and 1989 corn (Table 1; 
Tunick et al., 1994). 
Agreement between observed 
and predicted (i.e., modeled) radiation 
parameters (TRs, TPAR, RRs, RPAR, 
and Rn) was assessed using standard 
statistical parameters (observed and 
predicted mean; slope; intercept; coef-
ficient of determination, r2; root mean 
square error, RMSE; and bias), as well 
as, non-squared parameters described 
by Legates and McCabe (1999) 
(modified index of agreement, D; 
modified coefficient of efficiency, ε; 
and mean absolute error, MAE). D is 
similar to r2 in that 0 ≤ D ≤ 1, with 
greater values of D indicating better 
agreement between observed and pre-
dicted values. Values of ε range from -
∞ to 1, and ε = 0 indicates that the 
mean of all observed values is as good 
a predictor as the model (if ε < 0, then 
the mean of observed values is actually 
a better predictor than the model). 
MAE should be used in conjunction 
with RMSE, where the extent that 
RMSE > MAE indicates outliers in the 
data. We also computed RMSE di-
vided by the observed mean expressed 
as a percentage (RMSE/Ōobs). 
Statistical parame-
ters of model agree-
ment were tabulated 
for grain corn (Table 1), grain sorghum 
(Table 2), and upland cotton (Table 3) 
for each radiation parameter, consist-
ing of transmitted shortwave radiation 
(TRs), transmitted photosynthetically 
active radiation (TPAR), reflected 
shortwave radiation (RRs), reflected 
photosynthetically active radiation 
(RPAR), and total net radiation (Rn). 
Modeled vs. observed radiation pa-
rameters were plot for each crop 
(Figure 1). Overall, most data clustered 
about the 1:1 line with significant line-
arity (two-tailed Student t test, α = 
0.05). All root mean square error 
(RMSE) values were no greater than 
1.4 times the corresponding mean ab-
solute error (MAE) values, indicating 
reasonably low presence of outliers. 
The modified index of agreement (D) 
ranged from 0.664 for cotton Rn 
(Table 3) to 0.899 for corn TPAR 
(Table 1). All modified coefficient of 
efficiency (ε) values were greater than 
zero, meaning that all models contrib-
uted additional information beyond the 
means of observed values (Ōobs). The 
RMSE/Ōobs values were 30% or less, 
the largest resulting for corn RPAR 
(Table 1). These results were encour-
aging given the inherent difficulty in 
measuring radiation in plant canopy 
environments. 
Transmitted radiation (i.e., TRs 
and TPAR) tended to cluster at rela-
tively low values for corn and grain 
sorghum, because most measurements 
were obtained after canopy closure 
(Figure 1). Most of the greater values 
of TRs and TPAR were observed early 
in the season before full canopy, with 
very few occurring late in the season 
after leaf senescence. However, TRs 
and TPAR were more uniformly dis-
tributed across the range of values for 
cotton. These measurements were ob-
tained in a deficit-irrigated crop (i.e., 
50% of full irrigation requirement), 
with only about 40% of the soil surface 
covered. Therefore, a portion of the 
tube solarimeters (used to measure 
TRs) and line quantum sensors (used 
to measure TPAR) received direct 
sunlight during most of the day since 
the rows of the cotton crop were ori-
ented east-west. A similar experiment 
is presently underway with cotton rows 
oriented north-south, which will test 
the robustness of CN98 model refine-
ments. 
Reflected shortwave radiation 
(RRs) tended to be distributed some-
what uniformly in the observed range, 
whereas reflected photosynthetically 
active radiation (RPAR) tended to 
cluster at lower values of the observed 
range (Figure 1). This was expected 
because green leaves have much 
greater absorption (~0.85) of photo-
synthetically active radiation (i.e., visi-
ble spectrum around 400 to 700 nm) 
compared with near-infrared radiation 
(~0.15). The energy of visible and 
near-infrared radiation is distributed 
approximately equally in incoming 
shortwave radiation (Campbell and 
Norman, 1998). The modeled underes-
timates of RPAR for corn (first col-
umn, fourth plot in Figure 1) occurred 
late in the season, and were likely the 
result of tassels and senesced leaves 
not accounted for in the model. This 
was also observed for cotton, when 
leaf senescence may have exposed a 
greater amount of soil background 
(which has greater reflection in the 
visible spectrum). However, cotton 
RPAR was also overestimated early in 
the season when canopy cover was 
low, possibly due to reduced 
(underestimated) soil reflectance from 
wetting that was not accounted for. 
These errors could be easily addressed 
through actual measurements of sur-
face reflectance, which are routinely

obtained by ground-based, airborne, or 
satellite remote sensing platforms 
(Gowda et al., 2008). 
Total net radiation (Rn) had sys-
tematic bias, with overestimates for 
corn and grain sorghum but underesti-
mates for cotton, possibly the result of 
instrument calibration errors. The net 
radiometer deployed over the 2007 
grain sorghum had the closest agree-
ment with modeled values, which can 
be discerned as the cluster of points 
closest to the 1:1 line (second column, 
fifth plot in Figure 1). 
The Campbell and 
Norman (1998) ra-
diative transfer model (CN98) was 
evaluated with new refinements that 
accounted for the clumping nature of 
row crops for grain corn, grain sor-
ghum, and upland cotton. Acceptable 
model agreement was obtained for 
transmitted and reflected radiation, 
which is an important result for im-
proving crop water use models used in 
water resource management. Some 
error observed in reflected radiation 
parameters may have been due to leaf 
senescence later in the season that was 
not accounted for in the present ver-
sion of the model, and underestimates 
of soil reflectance due to wetting 
events. These errors could be easily 
addressed by using routine measure-
ments of surface reflectance from re-
mote sensing. Systematic bias was ob-
served for net radiation in all but one 
season, but this may have been due to 
instrument calibration errors. The 
CN98 model will continue to be vali-
dated and refined with different crop 
row orientations, as part of the Bush-
land Agricultural and Evapotranspira-
tion Experiment of 2008 BEAREX08).

Louis Baumhardt attended the 
statewide “Oklahoma No-Till 
Conference” for an invited 
presentation of research results 
on “Integrated crop-livestock 
production and tillage effects on 
crop yields”, Oklahoma City; 
February 11 and 12, 2008. 
 
From February 2-15, 2008, 
Research Soil Scientist Steve Evett traveled to Jordan to work 
with partners in the National Centre for Agricultural Research 
and Extension, the counterpart of USDA-ARS. A large (2.4 by 
3.0 by 2.5-m deep, 40-ton) weighing lysimeter was completed, 
calibrated and commissioned for service to determine crop 
water use and crop coefficients for irrigation scheduling in the 
Jordan Valley, where >80% of Jordanian irrigated agriculture 
exists. The weighing lysimeter is a key part of infrastructure 
for the Middle Eastern Regional Irrigation Management 
Information Systems project, a quadrilateral project managed 
by USDA-OIRP with research partners, weather stations, and 
irrigation trials in Israel, Jordan and Palestine and with USDA-
ARS partners at Bushland, Texas, and Fresno, California. The 
first crop for the lysimeter will be sweet corn, a high value 
crop in the Jordan Valley, which will be planted in April. 
Training on lysimeter operation, planning and conduct of field 
experiments, and analysis of lysimeter and weather data to 
complete knowledge of crop water use and irrigation 
scheduling coefficients was planned for the trip, but was 
postponed to a later time due to poor weather, equipment that 
was broken in shipping and the subsequent slippage in 
scheduling required to overcome these obstacles. Still, the 
completion of the $65,000.00 lysimeter after a multi-year 
effort is a major milestone on the road to more efficient 
utilization of water in irrigated agriculture of the region. 
 
José L. Chávez, Paul Colaizzi, Prasanna Gowda and Susan 
O’Shaughness welcomed students at a booth set up for the 
West Texas A&M University Spring Career Fair, February 28, 
2008, West Texas A& M University campus, Canyon, TX. 
 
Susan O’Shaughnessy led: In-House Training with Karen

Experiment 2008 (BEAREX08) field research activities. This 
resulted in an article “Measuring Water: Project aims to reduce 
use of aquifer by farms’ crops” by Mr. Welch in the Amarillo 
Globe News on Tuesday, June 10, 2008, page 6D. 
 
June 16, 2008, USDA Radio News interviewed Steve Evett 
about automated irrigation systems using infrared temperature 
sensors. Steve discussed the development of the automation 
system, first for drip irrigation and now for center pivot 
irrigation, and he pointed out that earlier research proved that 
the system works and developed the underlying theory and 
methods. System development is now focused on engineering 
robustness by including weather and soil water sensors and 
developing control code to produce as reliable a system as 
possible.

On September 2, 2008, Steve Evett plans to begin work at the Northwest 
Irrigation and Soils Research Laboratory, Kimberly, Idaho as Research 
Leader. Steve expects to continue strong collaborations with the Bush-
land research team, particularly since there are many parallel problems in 
irrigated agriculture being tackled by the two laboratories. This is a 
chance for Steve to assume a leadership role in ARS and to return to 
Southern Idaho where he was raised. Steve's e-mail address remains the 
same: Steve.Evett@ars.usda.gov. The main office number at USDA-
ARS, Kimberly is 208-423-5582. 
“We want everyone to know that we do not make this move lightly, particularly in light of the strong friendships that we have in 
the Amarillo area. There are a lot of pluses along with the minuses associated with leaving our Bushland family. In particular, we 
are excited to join the great ARS team at Kimberly and the Kimberly community and schools. Over the years there has been strong 
collaboration between the Bushland and Kimberly ARS teams, and I expect that this will only be reinforced by our move. Priscilla 
Sheets, my wife, will teach 5th grade at the Kimberly elementary school and Matthew, our son, will continue his education at the 
University of Colorado, Boulder. We want to express our sincere gratitude for all the friendships, collaborations, adventures and 
support that we experienced during the past 18 years in the Texas Panhandle as part of the Amarillo and Bushland communities 
and the great ARS team at Bushland. Anytime you all are in Southern Idaho, please look us up. We will be very glad to see you.”

Hello everybody! My name is Jairo 
Hernandez, and I joined the Soil and 
Water Management Research Unit in the 
USDA-ARS Conservation and 
Production Research Laboratory (CPRL), 
Bushland, TX as a post-doctoral 
researcher for Dr. Prasanna Gowda this 
May. My main research interests include 
groundwater modeling, ET remote 
sensing, and the application of artificial 
intelligence in water resources 
management. Currently I am involved in 
modeling of a 4-county area in the Texas 
Panhandle using the MODFLOW and ET 
remote sensing. This research is a part of 
the larger project titled “Impacts of 
alternative water policies on rural 
economies and aquifer hydrology” 
funded by the Ogallala Research 
Initiative.  
 
I am a Ph.D. graduate from Utah State 
University (USU) in the Biological and 
Irrigation Engineering Department 
specializing in irrigation engineering. I 
graduated in spring of 2008 and my 
dissertation’s title was “Canal Structure 
Automation Rules Using a Hydraulic 
Simulation Model, an Accuracy-based 
Learning Classifier System, and Genetic 
Algorithms.” Also, I have a M.S. degree 
in Water Resources and a B.S. degree in 
Civil Engineering from “Nacional de 
Colombia” University and “La Gran 
Colombia” University, respectively.  
 
I have more than twenty years of 
experience in hydrology and hydraulics, and I have worked for both private and public agencies in Bogota, Colombia before I 
moved to the USU to join the Ph.D. program under Dr. Gary Merkley. At USU, I worked in the Remote Sensing Services 
Laboratory as a graduate research associate and participated in developing a Geographic Information System (GIS) layers for 
irrigation management in the Dominican Republic. Finally, before starting with the USDA-ARS, I held a research assistant 
position at the USU Geomorphology Laboratory using remote sensing and GIS for monitoring sediment storage throughout river 
main channels, and mentored graduate students, too. I love computer programming, and I am proficient in Visual Basic, C++ and 
C#.  I am very pleased to be a part of the magnificent research team at CPRL. 
With the cost of gas soaring, a group of employees at the Conservation and Produc-
tion Research Laboratory recently invested in a used vehicle that was previously used 
by an adult daycare center. The “Bushland Express” is offered to fellow employees 
for a small fee. The route is approximately 50 miles round-trip. 
The Conservation and Production Research Laboratory employees 
have taken on the challenge of recycling materials used daily 
around the office. A trailer was purchased to transport cardboard to 
the recycling center. All boxes have to be completely flattened so 
that the recycler (Allied Waste) will accept the cardboard.
