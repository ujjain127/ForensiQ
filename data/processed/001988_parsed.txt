DIAMOND, INDUSTRIAL—2006 
21.1
DIAMOND, INDUSTRIAL
By Donald W. Olson
Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Linda M. White, statistical assistant, and Donald W. Olson, mineral 
commodity specialist. The world production tables were prepared by Glenn J. Wallace, international data coordinator.
In 2006, U.S. synthetic diamond production was estimated to 
be 258 million carats with an estimated value of $259 million. 
U.S. imports of all forms of industrial diamond totaled about 
373 million carats valued at almost $108 million, while exports 
totaled more than 101 million carats valued at almost $85.6 
million. The estimated U.S. apparent consumption of all forms 
of industrial diamond was 565 million carats with an estimated 
value of $302 million.
Diamond is best known as a gemstone, but some of its 
unique properties make it ideal for many industrial and research 
applications as well. Current information on gem-grade diamond 
can be found in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Minerals 
Yearbook, volume I, Metals and Minerals chapter on gemstones. 
Diamond that does not meet gem-quality standards for clarity, 
color, shape, or size is used as industrial-grade diamond. 
Production and consumption quantities and values reported are 
estimated to avoid disclosing company proprietary data and still 
provide useful data on the overall market. Trade data in this 
report are from the U.S. Census Bureau. All percentages in the 
report were computed using unrounded data.
Diamond is the hardest known material and has the highest 
thermal conductivity of any material at room temperature. 
Diamond is more than twice as hard as its nearest competitors, 
cubic boron nitride and silicon nitride (Ravi, 1994, p. 537). 
Because it is the hardest substance known, diamond has been 
used for centuries as an abrasive in cutting, drilling, grinding, 
and polishing. Industrial-grade diamond continues to be used as 
an abrasive for many applications. Even though it has a higher 
unit cost, diamond has proven to be more cost-effective in many 
industrial processes because it cuts faster and lasts longer than 
alternative abrasive materials (Boucher, 1997, p. 26.6). Diamond 
also has chemical, electrical, optical, and thermal characteristics 
that make it the best material available to industry for wear- 
and corrosion-resistant coatings, special lenses, heat sinks in 
electrical circuits, wire drawing, computing, and other advanced 
technologies.
Both synthetic and natural diamond have industrial uses. 
Synthetic industrial diamond is superior to its natural diamond 
counterpart because its properties can be tailored to speciﬁ c 
applications, and it can be produced in large quantities 
(Boucher, 1996). It is for these reasons that synthetic diamond 
accounts for nearly 99% of the industrial diamond used in the 
United States and about 88% of the industrial diamond used in 
the world.
Legislation and Government Programs
Congress has authorized the sale of all diamond in the 
National Defense Stockpile (NDS), which is managed by 
the Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC). The entire 
remaining inventory of the stockpiled diamond stones was 
authorized for sale in the NDS’s ﬁ scal year 2006 annual plan. 
One sale was held in October in which 126,523 carats valued 
at approximately $3.4 million were sold (Deister, 2006). At 
yearend 2006, the DNSC reported an NDS remaining inventory 
of about 393,000 carats of industrial diamond stone with a 
market value of $4.37 million (Jenkins, 2006). The DNSC 
planned to conduct additional sales until all NDS diamond stone 
stocks are sold.
Production
The USGS conducts an annual survey of domestic industrial 
diamond producers and U.S. ﬁ rms that recover diamond wastes. 
Although most of these companies responded to the 2006 
survey, one of the two U.S. primary producers of industrial 
diamond and one of the four industrial diamond recycling ﬁ rms 
withheld from reporting on the survey data that they deemed 
to be proprietary. To protect the proprietary data of other 
producers, only estimates of U.S. primary and secondary output 
are provided in this review.
As one of the world’s leading producers of synthetic industrial 
diamond, the United States accounted for an estimated output 
of 258 million carats valued at more than $259 million in 2006. 
Only two U.S. companies produced synthetic industrial diamond 
during the year—Diamond Innovations, Inc., Worthington, OH, 
and Mypodiamond, Inc., Smithﬁ eld, PA.
In 2006, nine companies also manufactured polycrystalline 
diamond (PCD) from synthetic diamond grit and powder. These 
companies were Dennis Tool Co., Houston, TX; Diamond 
Innovations; Novatek Inc., Provo, UT; Phoenix Crystal Corp., 
Ann Arbor, MI; Precorp Inc., Provo; SII Megadiamond 
Industries Inc., Provo; Tempo Technology Corp., Somerset, 
NJ; U.S. Synthetics Corp., Orem, UT; and Western Diamond 
Products, Salt Lake City, UT.
It is estimated that about 34.8 million carats of used industrial 
diamond was recycled in the United States during 2006. 
Recycling ﬁ rms recovered most of this material from used 
diamond drill bits, diamond tools, and other diamond-containing 
wastes. Additional diamond was recovered during the year from 
residues generated in the manufacture of PCD; most of this 
material was recovered from within the production operations of 
the PCD-producing companies.
The recovery and sale of industrial diamond was the principal 
business of four U.S. companies in 2006—Industrial Diamond 
Laboratory Inc., Bronx, NY; Industrial Diamond Powders Co., 
Pittsburgh, PA; International Diamond Services Inc., Houston, 
TX; and National Research Co., Fraser, MI. In addition to these 
companies, other domestic ﬁ rms may have recovered industrial 
diamond in smaller secondary operations.

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK—2006
There have been no commercially operated diamond mines 
in the United States since 2002. Diamond was produced at the 
Kelsey Lake diamond mine, located close to the Colorado-
Wyoming State line near Fort Collins, CO, for several years 
until April 2002. The Kelsey Lake property has now been fully 
reclaimed.
Studies by the Wyoming Geological Survey have shown that 
Wyoming has the potential for a $1 billion diamond mining 
business. Wyoming has many of the same geologic conditions 
that are found in the diamond-producing areas of Canada, 
and there is evidence of hundreds of kimberlite pipes in the 
State. There have been 20 diamondiferous kimberlite pipes 
and 1 diamondiferous maﬁ c breccia pipe identiﬁ ed in southern 
Wyoming. The State Line and the Iron Mountain kimberlite 
ﬁ elds of Wyoming are two of the largest kimberlite ﬁ elds in the 
United States, and the Leucite Hills lamproite ﬁ eld in Wyoming 
is the largest lamproite ﬁ eld in the United States. Several 
diamond mining ﬁ rms have shown interest in the northern 
Colorado and southern Wyoming area (Associated Press, 2002).
The success of Canadian diamond mines has also stimulated 
some interest in exploring for commercially feasible diamond 
deposits in the United States outside of Colorado and Wyoming, 
in Alaska, Minnesota, and Montana. Parts of Alaska have 
similar geologic terrain to the Northwest Territories; and some 
diamond indicator minerals, as well as some microscopic 
diamonds have been found near Anchorage, AK. This has 
lead to exploratory drilling by two Canadian companies. 
University of Minnesota geologists, teamed with an Australian 
mining company, have conducted a soil sampling program 
in Minnesota exploring for diamond and other mineral 
deposits. The samples are being analyzed by Australia’s WMC 
Resources Ltd., and they think that there is good chance of 
success owing to similarities between the geology in Canada 
and Minnesota (Diamond Registry Bulletin, 2005). Diamond 
deposit exploration is also being conducted near Lewistown, 
MT; a diamond-bearing kimberlite was found in a 32.4-hectare 
site known as the Homestead property. Preliminary tests have 
shown the presence of microscopic diamonds. Diamonds have 
been found in the stream beds and glacial valleys of Montana for 
years (Associated Press, 2004).
Consumption
The United States remained the world’s leading market for 
industrial diamond in 2006. Based on production estimates, 
trade data, and adjustments for Government stockpile sales, 
apparent U.S. consumption of industrial diamond during the 
year increased by about 28% to an estimated 565 million carats 
valued at $302 million. This apparent consumption was the 
combination of 564 million carats of diamond bort, grit, dust, 
and powder valued at $298 million and 1.30 million carats of 
diamond stone valued at $5.23 million.
The major consuming industries of industrial diamond in 
the United States during 2006 were construction, machinery 
manufacturing, mining services (exploration drilling 
for minerals, oil, and gas), stone cutting/polishing, and 
transportation systems (infrastructure and vehicles). Within 
these sectors, stone cutting and highway building/repair together 
made up the largest demand for industrial diamond. Research 
and high-technology uses included close-tolerance machining of 
ceramic parts for the aerospace industry, heat sinks in electronic 
circuits, lenses for laser radiation equipment, polishing of silicon 
wafers and disk drives, and other applications in the computer 
industry.
Diamond tools have numerous industrial functions. Diamond 
drilling bits and reaming shells are used principally for gas, 
mineral, and oil exploration. Other applications of diamond bits 
and reaming shells include foundation testing, masonry drilling, 
and inspecting concrete. The primary uses of point diamond 
tools are for dressing and truing grinding wheels and for 
boring, cutting, ﬁ nishing, and machining applications. Beveling 
glass for automobile windows is another application. Cutting 
dimension stone and cutting/grooving concrete in highway 
reconditioning are the main uses of diamond saws; other 
applications include cutting composites and forming refractory 
shapes for furnace linings. Very ﬁ ne diamond saws are used to 
slice brittle metals and crystals into thin wafers for electronic 
and electrical devices. Diamond wire dies are essential for high-
speed drawing of ﬁ ne wire, especially from hard, high-strength 
metals and alloys. The primary uses of diamond grinding 
wheels include edging plate glass, grinding dies, grinding parts 
for optical instruments, and sharpening and shaping carbide 
machine tool tips.
Two types of natural diamond are used by industry—diamond 
stone (generally larger than 60 mesh/250 micrometers) and 
diamond bort (smaller, fragmented material). Diamond stone is 
used mainly in drilling bits and reaming shells used by mining 
companies; it also is incorporated in single- or multiple-point 
diamond tools, diamond saws, diamond wheels, and diamond 
wire dies. Diamond bort is used for drilling bits and as a loose 
grain abrasive for polishing. Other tools that incorporate natural 
diamond include bearings, engraving points, glass cutters, and 
surgical instruments.
Synthetic diamond grit and powder are used in diamond 
grinding wheels, saws, impregnated bits and tools, and as a 
loose abrasive for polishing. Diamond grinding wheels can be as 
much as 1 meter in diameter.
Loose powders made with synthetic diamond for polishing 
are used primarily to ﬁ nish cutting tools, gemstones, jewel 
bearings, optical surfaces, silicon wafers, and wire-drawing 
dies for computer chips. Hundreds of other products made 
from ceramics, glass, metals, and plastics also are ﬁ nished with 
diamond powders.
The use of polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDCs) and 
polycrystalline diamond shapes (PDSs) continues to increase 
for many of the applications cited above, including some of 
those that employ natural diamond. The use of PDCs, PDSs, and 
matrix-set synthetic diamond grit for drilling bits and reaming 
shells has increased in recent years. PDCs and PDSs are used in 
the manufacture of single- and multiple-point tools, and PDCs 
are used in a majority of the diamond wire-drawing dies.
Apollo Diamond, Inc., near Boston, MA, has developed and 
patented a method for growing extremely pure, gem-quality 
diamond with ﬂ awless crystal structure by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD). The CVD technique transforms carbon 
into plasma, which then is precipitated onto a substrate as 
DIAMOND, INDUSTRIAL—2006 
21.3
diamond. CVD has been used for more than a decade to cover 
large surfaces with microscopic diamond crystals, but until this 
process, no one had discovered the combination of temperature, 
gas composition, and pressure that resulted in the growth of a 
single diamond crystal. CVD diamond precipitates as nearly 
100% pure, almost ﬂ awless diamond, and therefore may not 
be distinguishable from natural diamond by some tests (Davis, 
2003).
CVD diamond’s highest value besides its use as gemstones is 
as a material for high-tech uses. CVD diamond could be used 
to make extremely powerful lasers; to create cell phones that 
ﬁ t into a watch and storage devices for MP3 players that could 
store 10,000 movies, not just 10,000 songs; to create frictionless 
medical replacement joints; or as coatings for cars that would 
not scratch or wear out. The greatest potential use for CVD 
diamond is in computer technology (Maney, 2005). For diamond 
to be a practical material for use as a semiconductor, it must be 
affordably grown in large wafers. After Apollo’s process and 
technology are fully developed, CVD diamond could possibly 
be grown for prices as low as $5 per carat. CVD growth is 
limited only by the size of the seed placed in the diamond 
growing chamber. At the moment, the company is producing 10-
millimeter wafers but predicts it will reach about 10 times that in 
the near future (Davis, 2003). Scientists have said that diamond 
computer chips are more durable because they can work at 
temperatures up to 1,000° C, while silicon computer chips stop 
working at about 150° C. This means that diamond computer 
chips could work at a much higher frequency or faster speed and 
could be placed in a high-temperature environment (Diamond 
Registry Bulletin, 2003).
In early 2004, scientists at the Carnegie Institution of 
Washington’s Geophysical Laboratory published a study 
showing that researchers grew diamond crystals by a special 
CVD process at very high growth rates. They were able to grow 
gem-sized crystals in a day—a growth rate 100 times faster 
than other methods used before. This is a new way of producing 
diamond crystals for such new applications as diamond-based 
electronic devices and next generation cutting tools (Willis, 
2004). By early 2005, the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical 
Laboratory and the University of Alabama had jointly developed 
and patented the CVD process and apparatus to produce 10-
carat, ½-inch thick single diamond crystals at very rapid growth 
rates (100 micrometers per hour). This faster CVD method uses 
microwave plasma technology and allows multiple crystals 
to be grown simultaneously. This size is about ﬁ ve times that 
of commercially available lab-created diamonds produced by 
high pressures and high temperatures (HPHT) methods and 
other CVD techniques (Willis, 2004; Carnegie Institution of 
Washington, 2005; Science Blog, 2005).
Both Apollo Diamond and the Carnegie Institution have 
noted that their diamonds produced by the CVD method are 
harder than natural diamonds and diamonds produced by HPHT 
methods.
Prices
Natural and synthetic industrial diamonds differ signiﬁ cantly 
in price. Natural industrial diamond normally has a more limited 
range of values. Its price varies from an average of $0.94 per 
carat for bort size material to about $2 to $10 per carat for most 
stones, with some larger stones selling for up to $200 per carat.
Synthetic industrial diamond has a much larger price range 
than natural diamond. Prices of synthetic diamond vary 
according to particle strength, size, shape, crystallinity, and the 
absence or presence of metal coatings. In general, synthetic 
diamond prices for grinding and polishing range from as low as 
$0.37 to $1.67 per carat. Strong and blocky material for sawing 
and drilling sells for $1.50 to $3.50 per carat. Large synthetic 
crystals with excellent structure for speciﬁ c applications sell for 
many hundreds of dollars per carat (Law-West, 2002, p. 23.8).
Foreign Trade
The United States continued to lead the world in industrial 
diamond trade in 2006; imports were received from 49 
countries, exports were sent to 44 countries, and reexports were 
sent to 33 countries (tables 1-4). Although the United States 
has been a major producer of synthetic diamond for decades, 
growing domestic markets have become more reliant on foreign 
sources of industrial diamond in recent years. U.S. markets 
for natural industrial diamond always have been dependent on 
imports and secondary recovery operations because there has 
been no domestic production of natural diamond.
During 2006, U.S. imports of industrial-quality diamond 
stones (natural and synthetic) increased by 3% from those of 
2005 to about 2.17 million carats valued at more than $27.4 
million (table 1). Imports of diamond dust, grit, and powder 
(natural and synthetic) increased by 30% from those of 2005 to 
371 million carats valued at almost $80.5 million (table 2).
Reexports may account for a signiﬁ cant portion of total 
exports/reexports; therefore, exports and reexports are listed 
separately in tables 3 and 4 so that U.S. trade and consumption 
can be calculated more accurately. During 2006, U.S. exports 
of industrial diamond stones increased from those of 2005 to 
7,450 carats valued at $16,300, and U.S. reexports of industrial 
diamond stone increased by 9% from those of 2005 to 1.56 
million carats valued at $26.8 million (table 3). U.S. exports of 
industrial diamond dust, grit, and powder (natural and synthetic) 
decreased by 2% from those of 2005 to 90.3 million carats 
valued at $49.7 million, and reexports of industrial diamond 
dust, grit, and powder (natural and synthetic) decreased by 19% 
from those of 2005 to 9.41 million carats valued at $9.09 million 
(table 4).
World Industry Structure
In 2006, industrial diamond was produced in 28 countries 
(tables 5-6). Total industrial diamond output worldwide was 
estimated by the USGS to be about 646 million carats valued 
between $646 million and $1 billion. Natural industrial diamond 
production worldwide was estimated to be more than 79.9 
million carats, a 7% decrease compared with that of 2005. 
Congo (Kinshasa) was the leading producing country, followed 
by Australia and Russia, in descending order of quantity. These 
three countries produced more than 74% of the world’s natural 
industrial diamond (table 5). Synthetic industrial diamond 
21.4 
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK—2006
production worldwide was estimated to be more than 566 
million carats, a slight increase compared with that of the 
previous year. The United States was the leading producing 
country, followed by Russia, Ireland, and South Africa, in 
descending order of quantity. These four countries produced 
about 81% of the world’s synthetic industrial diamond (table 6).
In addition to the countries listed in table 6, Germany and 
the Republic of Korea produced synthetic diamond, but speciﬁ c 
data on their output could not be conﬁ rmed. China may have 
produced more than the output listed in the table (Wilson Born, 
President, National Research Co., oral commun., March 17, 
2004).
In 2006, 80% of the total global natural and synthetic 
industrial diamond output was produced in Ireland, Japan, 
Russia, South Africa, and the United States. Synthetic diamond 
accounted for more than 88% of global diamond production and 
consumption.
World Review
Canada.—The Ekati Diamond Mine, Canada’s ﬁ rst operating 
commercial diamond mine, completed its eighth full year 
of production in 2006. Ekati produced 2.52 million carats 
of diamond from 4.48 million metric tons (Mt) of ore (BHP 
Billiton Ltd., 2007). BHP Billiton Ltd. has an 80% controlling 
ownership in Ekati, which is in the Northwest Territories in 
Canada. Ekati has estimated reserves of 60.3 Mt of ore in 
kimberlite pipes that contain 54.3 million carats of diamond, 
and BHP Billiton projected the mine life to be 25 years. 
Approximately one-third of the Ekati diamond production is 
industrial-grade material (Darren Dyck, senior project geologist, 
BHP Diamonds, Inc., oral commun., May 27, 2001).
The Diavik Diamond Mine, also in the Northwest Territories, 
completed its fourth full year of production. In 2006, Diavik 
produced 9.8 million carats of diamond from two adjacent 
kimberlite pipes located within the same pit (Diavik Diamond 
Mines Inc., 2007). The mine will also be producing from a third 
kimberlite pipe by yearend 2007. Diavik has estimated the mine’s 
remaining proven and probable reserves to be 24.5 Mt of ore in 
kimberlite pipes, containing 81.7 million carats of diamond, and 
projected the mine life to be 16 to 22 years (Diavik Diamond 
Mine Dialogue, 2007). The mine is an unincorporated joint 
venture between Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. (60%) and Aber 
Diamond Mines Ltd. (40%). The mine is expected to produce a 
total of about 110 million carats of diamond at a rate of 8 million 
carats per year (Diavik Diamond Mines Inc., 2000, p. 10-12; 
Diavik Diamond Mine Dialogue, 2007).
Canada’s third diamond mine, the Jericho Diamond Mine 
wholly owned by Tahera Diamond Corp., began production of 
rough diamonds during the ﬁ rst quarter of 2006 and declared 
commercial production on July 1, 2006. The Jericho mine is 
located in Nunavut. Jericho experienced startup difﬁ culties, 
which persisted throughout 2006, but 539,000 t of kimberlite ore 
was processed, resulting in production of 296,000 carats. Tahera 
estimated the Jericho Diamond Mine’s reserves at 2.6 Mt of ore 
and 3.11 million carats of diamond.
Diamond exploration is continuing in Canada, with several 
other commercial diamond projects and additional discoveries 
located in Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, 
the Nunavut Territory, Ontario, and Quebec. Canada produced 
about 7% of the world’s combined natural gemstone and 
industrial diamond production in 2006.
Outlook
The United States will most likely continue to be the world’s 
leading market for industrial diamond well into the next decade. 
The United States also is expected to remain a signiﬁ cant 
producer and exporter of industrial diamond. The strength 
of U.S. demand will depend on the vitality of the Nation’s 
industrial base and on how well the diamond life cycle cost-
effectiveness compares with competing materials that initially are 
less expensive. Diamond offers many advantages for precision 
machining and longer tool life. In fact, even the use of wear-
resistant diamond coatings to increase the life of materials that 
compete with diamond is a rapidly growing application. Increased 
tool life not only leads to lower costs per unit of output but also 
means fewer tool changes and longer production runs (Advanced 
Materials & Processes, 1998). In view of the many advantages 
that come from increased tool life and reports that diamond ﬁ lm 
surfaces can increase durability by a factor of 50, much wider use 
of diamond as an engineering material is expected.
The most dramatic increase in domestic use of industrial 
diamond is likely to be in the construction sector as the 
Nation builds and repairs the U.S. highway system in its 
implementation of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efﬁ cient 
Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-59), which 
was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 
10, 2005, and by the U.S. Senate on May 17, 2005. This Act 
authorized appropriations for ﬁ scal years 2005 through 2009 for 
Federal-aid highway programs out of the Highway Trust Fund 
(U.S. House of Representatives, 2005). Demand for saw-grade 
diamond alone is expected to increase in 2007 if goals mandated 
by the Act for the repair and replacement of roads, bridges, 
and other components in the transportation infrastructure of the 
country are fulﬁ lled.
PCD for abrasive tools and wear parts will continue to 
replace competing materials in many industrial applications 
by providing closer tolerances as well as extending tool life. 
For example, PDCs and PDSs will continue to displace natural 
diamond stone and tungsten carbide products used in the 
drilling and tooling industries (Wilson Born, President, National 
Research Co., written commun., 1998).
Truing and dressing applications will remain a major domestic 
end use for natural industrial diamond stone. Stones for these 
applications have not yet been manufactured economically. No 
shortage of the stone is anticipated, however, because new mines 
and more producers selling in the rough diamond market will 
maintain ample supplies. More competition introduced by the 
additional sources also may temper price increases.
World demand for industrial diamond will continue to 
increase during the next few years. Constant dollar prices of 
synthetic diamond products, including CVD diamond ﬁ lms, will 
decline as production technologies become more cost effective 
and as competition increases from low-cost producers in China 
and Russia.
