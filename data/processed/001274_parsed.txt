Abstract
Thermochron iButtons incorporate the latest in digital technology, making
them smaller, less expensive, durable and potentially more reliable than
many other temperature logging devices. The objective of this study was to
test the accuracy of an inexpensive air temperature measurement system,
composed of a Thermochron iButton and radiation shield. Sixty-one iButtons
were subjected to a sequence of two water baths (0 °C and 24·9 °C) to
assess the absolute accuracy of the sensors. Five solar radiation shields
were tested in a greenhouse setting to evaluate the reduction in radiative
heating. Signiﬁcant differences (p < 0·05) were detected between instruments
subsequent to both water-bath treatment analyses. The accuracy of the
sensors was well within the manufacturer’s stated speciﬁcation of ±1·0 °C
with a collective temperature variance of ±0·21 °C. Temperature responses
generated by the Thermochron iButtons in different radiation shields were
consistent, but varied signiﬁcantly (p < 0·05) from 28 to 44 °C based on
diurnal temperature ranges. Results indicate that the Thermochron iButton
is an accurate, inexpensive alternative to more expensive temperature data-
logging systems, and is well suited for obtaining quality spatially distributed
data for hydrologic and water quality investigations. Copyright 2005 John

Introduction
Temperature is one of the most frequently measured environmental
variables for hydroclimatic investigations. Given the variability of air
temperature in natural systems, especially in complex mountainous
terrain, it is often most desirable to obtain spatially distributed continuous
measurements. For example, air temperature data are frequently needed
to assess micrometeorological variability for investigations dealing with
snow-cover processes, evapotranspiration rates, atmospheric boundary-
layer processes such as cold air drainage, water temperature dynamics,
and ecological processes. A number of small, relatively inexpensive
sensors for environmental applications have recently entered the market
(e.g. Hobo, Stowaway Tidbit, Optic Stowaway, Thermochron iButton).
When these sensors are used to measure air temperature, radiation shields
are also required to reduce sensor heating. The cost and size of these
sensors make them ideal for spatially distributed applications; however,
the performance of both the sensors and radiation shields must be
evaluated to assure data quality.
The Thermochron iButton (Maxim/Dallas, Dallas, TX) is a self-
contained temperature sensor and data logger enclosed in a watertight

two-terminal stainless steel can (Figure 1). This study
focuses on the DS1921L-F52 temperature data logger,
which is the most applicable for hydrologic applica-
tions given the speciﬁed temperature range of 20
to C85 °C at 0Ð5 °C resolution and with a manufac-
turer’s stated accuracy of š1 °C. Each iButton has a
unique digital identiﬁcation code and can store up to
2048 data points conﬁgurable from 1 to 255 min time
intervals. The unit contains 512 bytes of non-volatile
memory to store time, temperature, and a code for the
sampling location. It can also be programmed to ﬁll-
and-stop, or overwrite (ring-mode) ﬁnal data storage.
The iButton can log data for up to one million total
temperature measurements over the expected lifetime
of the unit (Marsh, 2003). The internal clock measures
seconds to years accurately to within š1 min per
month (Maxim/Dallas, Dallas, TX). Data are stored
as both raw values and in histogram format. The data
logger can be conﬁgured to record events outside of a
speciﬁed temperature range, as well as the start time,
duration, and whether the temperature was above or
below a given value (Marsh, 2003). Internal power
comes from a 3 V lithium power source that switches
to ‘parasite mode’ to obtain power from a peripheral
device during data transfer. The power unit can last
up to 10 years, depending on mode of application.
Within its protective stainless-steel enclosure, a
single silicon chip integrates a digital thermometer,
clock/calendar and protected memory. The iButton
uses a DS18S20 temperature sensing integrated cir-
cuit (IC) to measure temperature. IC temperature sen-
sors differ from many other types of sensor in two
important ways. The ﬁrst is operating temperature
range. Normally, the full range possible for tempera-
ture sensing ICs is 55 to C150 °C. However, some
devices are designed to go beyond this range, whereas
Figure 1. The dimensions (mm) of the Thermochron iButton are
identical for the entire DS1921 family and others. IO: input/output.
GRD: ground. A single data lead and ground is all that is needed for
data transfer
others, because of package or cost constraints, oper-
ate over a narrower range. The second major differ-
ence is functionality. A silicon temperature sensor is
an IC and can, therefore, include signal-processing
circuitry within the same small package as the sen-
sor (Maxim/Dallas, Dallas, TX). The sensing element
of the Thermochron iButton is a band-gap circuit,
which outputs a differential voltage proportional to
temperature. The digital thermometer measures tem-
perature with 8-bit (š0Ð5 °C) resolution by employing
a differential measurement between two diodes oper-
ating at different bias currents to derive temperature
values. Differential voltage is less prone to process
variations relative to a single diode (Marsh, 2003).
Further discussion regarding the functionality of this
device is beyond the scope of this study but can be
accessed through the Dallas/Maxim iButton Website
(www.ibutton.com). At the time of writing, Ther-
mochron iButtons sell for less than 16Ð00 USD each
and require a 15Ð00 USD interface kit and a PC with
a serial port (Maxim/Dallas, 2004).
To date, there has been no independent assess-
ment of the accuracy and precision of Thermochron
iButtons that we are aware of. The objectives of
this study were to test the performance of iButton
units and assess their efﬁcacy within a solar radiation
shield for distributed air temperature measurement.
The ﬁrst speciﬁc objective was to test the accuracy
of the DS1921L-F52 iButton, the stability of measure-
ment over time, and the variability between individual
devices. This work was also undertaken to assess
whether Thermochron iButtons are accurate to within
Dallas/Maxim speciﬁcations (i.e. š1 °C). The second
speciﬁc objective was to test the efﬁcacy of differ-
ent solar radiation shields and quantify the maximum
expected error due to solar heating.
Methods
Sensor variability assessment
Sixty-one Thermochron iButtons were evaluated in
0 °C and 24Ð9 °C water baths to span the range of
relevant temperatures for most warm-season environ-
mental investigations. The 0 °C ice bath consisted of
deionized water and deionized crushed ice that were
mixed to create an ice slurry in an insulated con-
tainer. A calibrated and certiﬁed mercury thermome-
ter (Kessler Instruments Inc., Amityville, NY) with
a range of 8 to C32 °C and resolution of 0Ð1 °C

was used to record the temperature of the ice bath.
The ice bath was agitated continuously throughout the
20 min test period to maintain a homogeneous tem-
perature of 0 °C throughout. Since they are watertight,
the iButtons were placed directly in the ice bath and,
therefore, were free to move around during the agi-
tation process. The iButtons were programmed to log
time and temperature data every minute during the
experiment. The warm water bath consisted of the
same regimen as the ice bath. The warm water bath
portion of the experiment took place in a Magni Whirl
temperature bath (Lindburg/Blue M Co., Asheville,
NC), at a constant temperature of 24Ð9 °C for 20 min.
The Magni Whirl contained two trays that were sub-
merged in deionized water and mechanically agitated.
The same calibrated mercury thermometer was used
to establish the reference temperature. The procedures
for both the ice and the warm water baths were con-
sistent with those outlined for mercury thermometer
calibration in the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM, 1981) and the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1990).
Radiation shield assessment
Five iButtons were installed in a greenhouse to assess
and compare the efﬁcacy of different solar radiation
shields relative to an unshielded sensor. The radia-
tion shield experiment was designed to subject the
sensors to a worst-case scenario (e.g. solar heating
with negligible ventilation), to gain a better apprecia-
tion for temperature response of the sensors in vary-
ing shield types. Three Gill model 41 002, six-plate
radiation shields (R. M. Young Co., Traverse City,
MI) and one Spectrum six-plate (Spectrum Technolo-
gies, Plainﬁeld, IL) radiation shield were used for the
radiation shield experiment. One of the Gill shields
was aspirated with a 12 V (1Ð6 W) 5 cm2 computer
processor cooling fan as a reference shield. It is gener-
ally accepted that mechanically aspirated temperature
measurements are the most accurate (WMO, 1996).
For the aspirated shield used here, the fan was sand-
wiched between the third and ﬁfth plates (fourth plate
removed) of the radiation shield, thereby pulling air
up past the iButton data logger and out beneath the top
plate of the shield. The cost of each of these shields
is approximately 160Ð00 USD and 45Ð00 USD for the
Gill and Spectrum shields respectively.
All ﬁve iButtons and their respective shields (one
without a radiation shield) were installed in a green-
house for a 24 h period under cloudless conditions
to assess thermal response variation between differ-
ing types of shield. All windows and doors were
closed and no fans operated in the greenhouse during
the experiment. The radiation shields were oriented
approximately 2 m above the ground on PVC scaf-
folding created for this experiment. The shields were
held in a nearly concentric ring around the centre of
the scaffold with a distance of at least 40 cm from
each other. In this manner, all shields were occupying
similar space, without altering the microclimate of a
neighbouring shield. Data acquired using the two non-
aspirated Gill shields were averaged for subsequent
analysis.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were followed with one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect signiﬁcant
differences (95% conﬁdence interval) in mean val-
ues between control and treatment variables. Where
signiﬁcant differences did occur (p < 0Ð05), one-way
ANOVA was followed by post hoc multiple compar-
ison tests of speciﬁc means using the Dunnett test
or Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference (HSD) test
(Sokal and Rohlf, 1981; Zar, 1996). The Dunnett test
treats one group (data set) as a control and com-
pares all other groups against it and was thus used
for the ice and warm water bath experiments where
the control was the calibrated mercury thermometer.
Tukey’s HSD test compares all groups against each
other and, therefore, was used for the solar radiation
shield assessment (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981; Zar, 1996).
Results
During the ice bath experiment, all of the Ther-
mochron iButtons recorded temperatures within the
Maxim/Dallas stated accuracy of š1 °C. The mini-
mum temperature recorded was 0Ð5 °C. The collec-
tive mean of temperature data collected by the iButton
sensors during the ice bath experiment was 0Ð19 °C,
which is well within the stated accuracy range of
š1 °C. Of the total 1220 data points (time and tem-
perature) collected during the ice bath portion of this
experiment 34, 712, 454, and 20 (3%, 58%, 37%, and
2% respectively) of those data points corresponded
to 0Ð5 °C, 0Ð0 °C, 0Ð5 °C, and 1Ð0 °C respectively

(Figure 2). One-way ANOVA generated for the ice
water bath revealed that despite close proximity to
the reference temperature (0Ð0 °C), with a collective
mean temperature of 0Ð19 °C, there was a signiﬁcant
difference (p < 0Ð05) detected between the reference
temperature and the group mean of the Thermochron
iButtons (0Ð19 °C).
For treatment and control multiple comparisons,
one-way ANOVA was followed by the Dunnett test.
Results indicated that at the p < 0Ð05 conﬁdence
interval, 28 of the 61 Thermochron iButtons used in
this portion of the experiment recorded mean temper-
atures signiﬁcantly different from the mean tempera-
ture of the calibrated thermometer (0Ð0 °C) for a total
of 45Ð9% of the devices. This indicates that these 28
devices, at some point in the experiment, recorded
temperatures that were between 0Ð5 and 1Ð0 °C differ-
ent than the reference temperature. This is still within
the Maxim/Dallas stated accuracy of š1 °C.
Descriptive statistics of the warm water bath exper-
iment showed that the Thermochron iButtons again
recorded temperatures within the Maxim/Dallas stated
accuracy of š1 °C. In this portion of the experiment
all iButtons recorded temperatures that were within
1 °C of the calibration temperature of 24Ð9 °C. The
overall minimum temperature recorded by a Ther-
mochron iButton was 24Ð0 °C, and the maximum was
25Ð5 °C. The overall mean for this portion of the
experiment was 24Ð67 °C, placing the iButtons well
within the stated accuracy range with a collective
average only 0Ð23 °C below the reference temperature
of 24Ð9 °C.

Of the total 1220 data points collected during the
warm water bath portion of this experiment, 20, 776,
404, and 20 (2%, 63%, 33%, and 2% respectively)
of the data points corresponded to 24Ð0 °C, 24Ð5 °C,
25Ð0 °C, and 25Ð5 °C respectively (Figure 3). One-way
ANOVA indicated that, again, despite the relative
proximity to the calibrated thermometer temperature
(24Ð9 °C), there was a signiﬁcant difference at the
p < 0Ð05 level detected between the calibrated mer-
cury thermometer mean and the group mean of the
Thermochron iButtons (24Ð67 °C). For treatment ver-
sus control multiple comparisons of the warm water
bath, the Dunnett multiple comparison test followed
one-way ANOVA. Results indicated that, at the p <
0Ð05 level, 55 out of the total 61 Thermochron iBut-
tons used in this portion of the experiment resulted
in mean temperatures that were signiﬁcantly differ-
ent from the mean temperature of the reference ther-
mometer (24Ð9 °C) for a total of 90Ð2% of the devices.
During at least some of the recording time, these
55 devices recorded temperatures that were between
0Ð5 and 0Ð9 °C different than the reference tempera-
ture (still within the Maxim/Dallas stated accuracy of
š1 °C).
Solar radiation experiment
Descriptive statistics for the solar radiation data
(Table I) revealed that mean temperatures recorded
by the Thermochron iButton shielded by the aspirated
Gill radiation shield were lower and less variable
than all other radiation shields, with a mean temper-
ature of 18Ð26 °C collected at 1 min resolution. The

temperature of 23Ð42 °C during the same time period.
The non-aspirated Gill and Spectrum radiation shields
exhibited mean daily temperatures of 20Ð46 °C and

stated accuracy. Within the group of iButtons,
only two devices logged temperatures that were
exactly 1Ð0 °C over the calibration temperatures, and
no instruments registered temperatures greater than
š1 °C beyond the respective reference temperatures.
Since all the Thermochron iButtons received the same
treatment in these experiments, it is assumed that the
temperature departure is attributable to variations in
instrument manufacture.
Although the observed temperature differences

temperatures
exactly
the
same
as
the
mercury
thermometer (total data points: 952) do not surpass
the guaranteed accuracy of š1 °C (most less than
š0Ð5 °C of calibration temperatures), quantitatively
the temperature differences are signiﬁcant at the
95% conﬁdence level, as demonstrated by statistical
analysis.
With 61 instruments and 1220 data points (time
and temperature), the ice bath experiment yielded
an average iButton temperature of 0Ð19 °C above the
reference temperature of 0Ð0 °C whereas iButtons in
the warm water experiment averaged 0Ð23 °C below
the reference temperature of 24Ð9 °C recorded by
the reference thermometer. It may be worth noting
that the average difference was greater for the warm
water bath than the ice bath. Although this may be
negligible, it may indicate that Thermochron iButtons
respond to higher temperatures differently than lower
temperatures. This can only be ascertained through
further investigation. Of the data collected by the
Thermochron iButtons in the ice bath, 95% were
within š0Ð5 °C of the reference temperature of 0Ð0 °C,
and 98% were within š0Ð5 °C of the reference in the
warm water.
Although an accuracy of š1 °C may be acceptable
for many hydrological investigations, this research
suggests that pre-screening sensors in controlled-
temperature environments may improve upon the
manufacturer-speciﬁed accuracy. For example, sen-
sors that measure absolute temperature differences in
excess of 0Ð5 °C could be discarded, such that the
remaining sensors all exhibit accuracy within 0Ð5 °C
of reference temperatures. Results from this investi-
gation indicate that less than 3% of sensors would be
rejected given these constraints. Given the low cost
of these devices, rejection of a small percentage of
sensors may be an acceptable option.
Radiation shield experiment
The results of the work conducted with differing radi-
ation shield types will be of value to researchers
requiring spatially distributed air temperature mea-
surements. The resulting data analysis showed compa-
rable trends yet contrasting maximum responses due
to solar diurnal cycling on the part of all the iButtons.
In light of the large difference in cost of the
devices used in this work (¾45Ð00 USD and ¾160Ð00
USD for the Spectrum and Gill shields respectively),
the relatively small difference in accuracy between
devices may not be worth the extra expense. It is
worth noting that these results represent a worst-case
scenario for air temperature measurement because of
the low natural ventilation in the greenhouse setting.
In a natural setting, the differences between the nat-
urally ventilated and mechanically aspirated shields
are expected to be lower. However, large differences
may result under clear conditions when installed over
a high-albedo surface, causing sensors to receive
upwelling solar radiation (Georges and Kaser, 2002).
Conclusions
The Thermochron iButton temperature data logger is
factory guaranteed to measure temperature to within
š1 °C. The results showed that, collectively, the Ther-
mochron iButtons were accurate well within š1Ð0 °C
greater than 99% of the time. Statistical analyses
showed that there was a signiﬁcant difference between
temperatures recorded by some Thermochron iBut-
tons, although these differences may be negligible
depending on the application. Pre-screening of sen-
sors using similar methods may increase the accuracy
of a group of sensors to within š0Ð5 °C, which is
suitable for most hydrological or other environmen-
tal applications. The solar radiation shield experiment
showed a relatively close relationship between the
control (aspirated Gill shield) and the other shield
employed, indicating that the type of radiation shield
may not be as important as whether or not it is aspi-
rated. Future validation studies for the Thermochron
iButton should involve ﬁeld-testing procedures sim-
ilar to those conducted here, testing a wider range
of environmental conditions and the signiﬁcance of
ventilation relative to shielding, as well as consider-
ing whether the calibration of Thermochron iButtons
changes with use and sensor aging.

SCIENTIFIC BRIEFING
Thermochron iButtons exhibit many advantages
over other temperature data-logging systems, the pri-
mary one being their cost. Other beneﬁts include
their small size and applicability to a vast range of
environmental research questions. Disadvantages of
Thermochron iButtons include a lack of ﬁnal stor-
age space. Storage space equipped to handle 2048
data points often does not allow for long term, high-
resolution recordings. This number has recently been
doubled in the DS1922L/T sensor to 4096 data points.
However, this can still be somewhat limiting for
environmental applications. Results from this study
showed that the Thermochron iButton is a practical,
inexpensive replacement for more expensive temper-
ature data-logging systems, and is thus well suited for
obtaining quality spatially distributed data for hydro-
logic and water quality investigations.
