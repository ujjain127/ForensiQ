Dear Madame/Sir:

I am writing in regard to the concern about the safety of dental amalgams.  The following facts have been scientifically established:

            1.  Mercury is a severe neurotoxin.

            2.  Mercury is emitted by amalgam fillings and absorbed by the host.

            3.  Approximately 80% of the mercury load of an individual with amalgam fillings results from these fillings.

I am well aware that there has yet to be a study that corrects amalgam fillings with health risks, but these studies have a finite accuracy.  That is, these studies are unable to show that amalgam fillings affect human health to within a certain accuracy (e.g., 5%-20% accuracy).  Even if 1% of the population was affected by amalgam fillings, it is a large number of affected people.

Today with the availability of nontoxic ceramic filling materials that have been proven to be effective and reliable, it is unethical to still be using this dangerous and outdate material.  

I understand that this is a hot political issue.  The dental establishment is holding on to dental amalgams because they cannot face the fact that they have been endangering their clients and themselves for so many years.  On the other hand, it is time for the FDA for once to stand up and do what is right and proper for the people of the US.
